The central question this year's group addressed was the relationship between the prescriptive traditions mandated by the many strands of Judaism, and the actual practices of Jews. Historians were no more likely to assume that a single, normative Jewish tradition existed than anthropologists were, but the research questions, the methodologies, and the sources of evidence varied significantly from one researcher to another. We asked how to integrate them in order to have a more dynamic understanding of Judaism and Jewish culture.\n\nOne of the key questions of the year was how to understand the relationship between sacred texts and practices, and as a corollary, under what social conditions texts become authoritative, to which communities and why. These questions allowed the seminar to focus on a particularly broad spectrum of Jewish life in both time and space: work was conducted on Jews in both the West and the Near East, in virtually every time period, and in Christian, Islamic, and secular societies, as well as in the modern State of Israel. We also reflected on an equally wide range of formulations of Judaism, which included, for example, mysticism, Sephardic saint veneration, Karaite and rabbinic rituals, pilgrimage, magic, Renewal, and nationalism.\n\nThese conversations led us to challenge some of the boundaries in the field that separated elite formulations from popular expressions, texts reflecting visual, oral, or embodied practices, and competing expressions of Jewish identity. We asked if an anthropology of Judaism could exist in the way that histories of Judaism do, and in so asking problematized the notion of a single Judaism or the dominance of text and history. The documents in this exhibition will reflect our rethinking of authority, textuality, and representation in the many expressions of Judaism that we study.\n\n**Riv-Ellen Prell, University of Minnesota**\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### The Second Benjamin\n\nDan Ben-Amos\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Ben-Amos.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/second-benjamin?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Ben-Amos-h.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/second-benjamin?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Ben-Amos-e.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/second-benjamin?item=2)\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: right\">\u003Cstrong>ישראל בן יוסף בנימין, ספר מסעי ישראל, בו יסופר מאחינו בני ישראל בארצות אסיה ואפריקה, מצבם המדיני והמוסרי, מדותיהם דעותיהם ומנהגיהם, טובם ועשרם, ענים ומרודיהם, דבר לא נעדר, ככל אשר ראה בעיניו והתבונן על כל דרכיהם במסעותיו זה שנים רבות בארצות הקדם, הנוסע המפורסם בימינו אלה\u003C/strong>.\u003Cbr>תרגם דוד גארדאן. ליק, תרי\"ט 1859\u003C/p>\n\nIsrael Joseph Benjamin (1818-1864), who was born in Falticeni, Moldavia, became an explorer by default. A lumber trader, he lost money in his business at the age of 25, and decided to travel in search of the Ten Lost Tribes, leaving behind his pregnant wife and five year old son. Fashioning himself as _Binyamin ha-Sheni_, (The Second Benjamin)---the medieval Benjamin of Tudela (12th century) being the first---he recorded his travels to the Jewish communities in the Near East, Central Asia, and North Africa in his book _Masey Jsrael_. The book appeared first in French as _Cinq annees de voyage en orient 1846-1851_ (Paris: M. Levi, 1856), and later, adding to his reports three more years of travels in German in two successive editions as _Acht jahre in Asien und Afrika von 1846 bis 1855_ (Hannover, 1858) and in English as _Eight Years in Asia and Africa, from 1846-1855_(Hanover, 1859). The Hebrew translation, now extremely rare, was done by David Gordon.\n\nIn his travels through Turkey, Erez Israel, Syria, Armenia, Iraq, Kurdistan, India, Afghanistan, Singapore, China, Iran and Egypt. After a brief return to Europe, he continued his travels through Spain to North Africa. Benjamin describes the rural and urban landscapes in these countries. In his book descriptions of the Jewish communities he offers not only his impressions of their economic and social conditions, but also record numerous traditions of local legends associated with tombs, caves and other geographical features. In Morocco he recorded a unique version of the martyrdom story of Sol (Suleika) Hachuel, of Tangier (1817-1834), the news of whose death reverberated through Europe in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\n### Less is More, None is All\n\nMenahem Ben-Sasson\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Ben-Sasson.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nWhat are the essential elements that make a ceremony what it is, and what do they mean? Are there commonly agreed upon meanings assigned to ceremonial expressions that would be accepted in more than one culture, context and set of events? And if so how do historians interpret these expressions?\n\nThe empty space found around the heads of hierarchical figures is one such expression. A figure represented in this way visually emphasizes his or her importance. In a few \"Jewish-National-Ceremonies\" of the Middle Ages, this empty space signifies the leader among the people - such as the empty seat next to the Exchilarch and the space between the Gaon and the people before and after him. This feature is well-documented in non-Jewish chancelleries where official documents of the Caliphate were written with capacious line-spacing notably greater than the amount of space allotted for any regular office of the administration. We find the same phenomenon in the original writings of Jewish leaders. In addition, a Jewish leader's signature usually will be found at the end of a document separated from the others by a generous empty space. This spacing pattern points to the hierarchy of the signatories (if more than one name is signed) or to the importance of an individual signatory. Such documents can easily be found in our CAJS collection, among them Halper 365 \\[Fustat. 1066-1108?\\], copied by a Hillel ben Eli, in which a certain Sitt al-Dar, wife of Sedaka ha-Levi, promises to comply with the stipulation of her late brother (also named Sedaka), that she should provide for her mother and for her mother's funeral. At bottom, the witnesses Yosef ben Elazar ha-Mumheh, Elazar ben Eli ha-Kohen, Yosef ben Nisim ha-Kohen, and Yakhin ben Avraham sign the document, their signatures appearing in the order and length respective to each witness' status.\n\n### Virtual Martyrs\n\nRa'anan (Abusch) Boustan\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Boustan.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/virtual-martyrs?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Boustan1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/virtual-martyrs?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Boustan2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/virtual-martyrs?item=2)\n\nTitle page of _Sefer Yihus ha-Tsadikim_ (_Genealogy of the Righteous_), edited by Abraham Moshe Lunz (Jerusalem, 1896). This text, likely assembled in something resembling its final form in the late fifteenth century, is a fully developed itinerarium for Jewish pilgrims to the Holy Land. Several pages from a first edition edited by Solomon ben Yohai in Constantinople, 1515-1520 are preserved. The oldest extant edition was printed by Gershom ben Asher of Scarmela in Mantua, 1561 and reprinted in the edition pictured here by Abraham Moshe Lunz, the blind researcher and collector of medieval Jewish geographic literature about Palestine.\n\nThis text represents the culmination of a long evolutionary process, which shaped Jewish pilgrimage practice in the Middle Ages (on which see Elchanan Reiner, \"Traditions of Holy Places in Medieval Palestine: Oral versus Written,\" in _Offerings from Jerusalem: Portrayals of Holy Places by Jewish Artists_, ed. R. Sarfati \\[Jerusalem: The Israel Museum\\], 9-19 \\[English\\] and 9-17 \\[Hebrew\\]). The creator(s) of this text collected and edited numerous legal and legendary traditions from earlier rabbinic (and para-rabbinic?) sources into what might best be called \"hagiographic catenae.\" These catenae are to be recited at the tombs of sages as well as at such holy sites as the ruins of the Jerusalem Temple. A hagiography of the R. Ishmael ben Elisha (buried at Kefar Kana) appears on pp. 85-87; this narrative is constructed from: the opening of the martyrology in MekhY, Nezikin 18 on Exod 22:22; sections of the \"martyr-narrative\" in Hekhalot Rabati (Synopse, ''107-109, 111); parts of the \"David-apocalypse\" (Synopse, ''122-126); and the beginning of the havurah-account in Hekhalot Rabati (Synopse, ''203). Different hagiographic accounts of \"R. Ishmael\" (buried at Farod) and \"R. Ishmael ben Kohen Gadol\" (buried at Shizur) appear on pp. 62-63 and 68-69 respectively, thereby attesting to the dynamism and creativity of this genre of literature. Various legendary traditions concerning \"Rabban Gamaliel, who was among the ten martyrs\" are collected on p. 88. The sources and composition of this text, especially its reception and use of Hekhalot literature, deserves further consideration.\n\n### Proving the Soul\n\nYossi Chajes\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Chajes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n_Nishmat Hayim_ (Amsterdam, 1652) was written and published by R. Menasseh ben Israel (1604-1657). The work is a sustained attempt to argue for the eternality of the soul against skeptics who argued that such a belief could not be maintained for philosophical (and scriptural) reasons. To confute the skeptics, Menasseh marshalled evidence from a wide range of sources to prove that souls endure after bodily death. Biblical passages, classical rabbinic literature, Gentile scholarship, and kabbalistic texts are all adduced to make this case. On top of them all, Menasseh adds what he considered to be the the best empirical evidence of the existence of a spirit world: contemporary ethnographic accounts (often travelers' reports from the New World) and stories of spirit possession. In an era when belief in God was being questioned by the likes of Spinoza—himself a former pupil of Rabbi Menasseh—eye-witness accounts of demonic activity furnished an indirect proof for His existence in the hip empiricist language of the day.\n\n### Writing Orality\n\nTalya Fishman\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Fishman.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/writing-orality?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Fishman1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/writing-orality?item=1)\n\nWriting in twelfth century France, at a time when variant manuscripts of the Babylonian Talmud were in circulation, the most famous talmudic glossator, the Tosafist Rabbenu Jacob ben Meir Tam, attacked the rampant practice of textual emendation of rabbinic writings in his Introduction to _Sefer ha-Yashar_, i.e., \"The Book of Probity.\" This critical perspective points to the emergence of two new historical conditions: (a) Written texts of the Oral Torah were no longer be regarded as _aides de memoire_, for had that been the case, lexical variants would not be a cause for concern. (b) There were now critical readers who paid attention to changes between one manuscript recension and another.\n\n### Mordecai Ha-Cohen\n\nHarvey Goldberg\n\n\\[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Goldberg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\\]\n\nMordecai Ha-Cohen (second from left) was born in Tripoli, Libya, in 1856 and died in Benghazi in the late 1920s. His grandfather, originally from Genoa, settled in Tripoli, while his father, a merchant, died in a shipwreck and the family lost all its wealth. Growing up with limited means, Ha-Cohen became an autodidact, persistently seeking Jewish and general knowledge. Influenced by the Hebrew _haskala_, he authored a book on the history, institutions, and customs of the Jews of his native land, calling the book _Highid Mordekhai_ (Jerusalem, Ben-Zvi Institute, 1978). In 1906 he served as a guide to Russian-born Nahum Slouschz, a Sorbonne-trained orientalist sent on a mission to Tripoli by the Alliance Israilite Universelle. Ha-Cohen guided Slouschz as they visited small Jewish communities in the Tripolitanian hinterland, including mountain areas where Berber-speaking groups lived. _Highid Mordekhai_ contains rich descriptions of these communities, which in many ways are more valuable than the ethnography provided by Slouschz in his publications. This ethnographic material appears in English as _The Book of Mordechai_ (London, Darf, 1993, ed. Harvey E. Goldberg). Later in life, Ha-Cohen moved to Benghazi where he became a member of the rabbinic court. In the picture, the secretary of the court is to his left and two other judges are to his right.\n\n### Responsa from Heaven\n\nEphraim Kanarfogel\n\n### [\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Kanarfogel.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/responsa-heaven?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Kanarfogel2b.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/responsa-heaven?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Kanarfogel1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/responsa-heaven?item=2)\n\nIn the first years of the thirteenth century, Rabbi Jacob of Marvège produced a unique treatise entitled _Responsa from Heaven_ (_She'elot u-Teshuvot min ha-Shamayim_). He attempted to answer halakhic questions or dilemmas of long standing by addressing these questions to the Almighty, apparently through a mystical technique known as the dream question (_she'elat halom_). The answers were transmitted to Jacob by a cohort of angels, often in the form of biblical verses. The versions of this work found in manuscript form (which sometimes contain questions not found in the published edition) suggest that it enjoyed a degree of popularity. A number of medieval and modern rabbinic authorities cite this work as an authoritative source, despite the rabbinic interpretation of the biblical phrase (\"for it is not in heaven,\" _lo ba-shamayim hi_), that Jewish law should not be decided through heavenly means or intervention.\n\n### Operations Exodus\n\nTamar Katriel\n\n### [\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Katriel_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/operations-exodus?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Katriel.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/operations-exodus?item=1)\n\nThe post-independence history of Israel has been punctuated by national events known as _aliyot hatzala_, which I have translated as \"salvage immigrations,\" which resulted in the transport of practically entire Jewish communities (or what was left of them) to Israel. These rescue projects, such as \"Operation Magic Carpet\" that brought Jews from Yemen and \"Operation Ezra and Nehemia\" that trasported Iraqi Jews, both in the early 1950s, or \"Operations Moses\" and \"Operation Solomon\" that transported Ethiopian Jews 1984-5 and 1991, respectively, have become part of Israel's foundation mythology. They are also part of a trans-communal narrative of peoplehood within the Jewish world that is grounded in shared belonging and mutual commitment. My study attempts to re-capture the human and national dramas depicted in hegemonic versions of \"salvage immigration\" narratives, but also attends to the ways in which they have been renegotiated and contested by various participants on the Israeli cultural scene over the years.\n\n### Pulp Pilgrims\n\nOran Kosansky\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Kosansky_Shanot.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/pulp-pilgrims?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Kosansky_Pinto.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/pulp-pilgrims?item=1)\n\nIn Jewish Morocco, the twentieth century witnessed the emergence and transformation of new forms of hagiographic literature dedicated to recounting the lives and miracles of deceased, sainted rabbis. These texts, and the social contexts in which they have been animated, demonstrate the ways in which Judaic practice in Morocco is situated at the intersection between authoritative rabbinic traditions and historical developments. The Hebrew text depicted here is the cover of a hagiographic volume entitled _Shenot Haim_. Published in 1961 as a Judeo-Arabic translation of a Hebrew original, _Shenot Haim_ deals predominantly with a single rabbinic lineage whose past members are buried in shrines which remain the object of pilgrimage. The text is constituted as a hybrid genre drawing on European Jewish literary precedents, rabbinic textual forms of authorization, and local language practices. _Shenot Haim_ is crafted, and in many cases is popularly recognized, as a form of authoritative rabbinic exegesis through which Moroccan hagiographic and pilgrimage traditions are constituted in resolutely Judaic terms.\n\nDespite the obvious formal differences between the Hebrew text and the French comic strip, the latter published at the end of the twentieth century, there are significant continuities between the two. Not only do both deal with the same saint (Rabbi Haim Pinto); the narrative of the comic strip is in fact taken almost verbatim from an episode recounted in _Shenot Haim_. Moreover, both texts were produced under the guidance of living members of the Pinto lineage who, in their respective times, exploited current technologies and popular idioms to disseminate their message to the widest possible audience. Finally, insofar as both these and similar texts continue to circulate, they contribute to the ongoing vitality of hagiographic and pilgrimage traditions in Morocco and its Jewish diaspora.\n\n### How \"to how to\"\n\nJack Kugelmass\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Kugelmass.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Kugelmass1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n\"How to\" books are a strikingly productive genre of American Jewish culture. Basically, parodic etiquette guides, these generally slim volumes focus on the incongruities between Jewish and the majority culture. Given the centrality of language to culture, not surprisingly these books make much of the uniqueness of Jewish American speech styles. The humorous strategies vary from book to book: Molly Katz's _Jewish As A Second Language_ focuses primarily on syntax and conversational style; Lawrence Lariar's Yankee Yiddish plays on the humorous homonymy of parallel speech codes.\n\n### Messianic Geography: The Mount of Olives in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Tradition\n\nOra Limor\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Limor.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nSince the seventh century, believers of the three faiths — Judaism, Christianity and Islam — have lived in Jerusalem side by side, struggling with and influencing each other. While some of their sacred traditions concerning Jerusalem and its particular holy sites are held only by believers of one religion, many others are common to two religions or even to all three. These common traditions were sometimes a basis for dialogue, but more often they became a bone of contention between the believers.\n\nThe Mount of Olives, situated to the east of Jerusalem, is an outstanding example of the complex nature of religious processes and religious dialogue revealed in sacred spaces. For believers of all three religions the Mount is charged with messianic tension as the arena of eschatological events at the End of Time, and as bearing signs of messianic promises in the past and in the present. All three groups of believers agreed that the Mount would be the stage of Resurrection and Judgment, where the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth would be launched. They disagreed over the details of the myth: Who would be the Messiah — the Judge, where is the precise site of his future appearance, and who will be redeemed. Thus, my project is a comparative historical research of the traditions and rituals of the three religions relating to one and the same place — the Mount of Olives, using literary, historical, and anthropological investigation of religious practices.\n\n### Suburban Judaism\n\nRiv-Ellen Prell\n\n### [\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Prell.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/suburban-judaism?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Prell1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/suburban-judaism?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Prell3.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/suburban-judaism?item=2)\n\nFollowing World War II American Jews living in major urban centers underwent two related changes. A significant number of them (there are no exact figures) moved to the suburbs and there they joined synagogues. Six hundred new synagogues were built in the period immediately following the end of the war. This period also had the highest rate of synagogue affiliation, about 52%. American Jews made choices similar to other whites in this regard, however a far greater percentage of Jews moved to the suburbs in comparison to other religious and ethnic group.\n\nThe impact of suburbanization on Jews was a subject regularly debated in Jewish journals and magazines of the time. Intellectuals, social workers, writers, rabbis, lay leaders and ordinary Jews wrote about the differences between the urban environment where Jewish life was \"natural,\" versus the suburban world in which Jews were a minority and the streets reflected nothing of a public Jewish life. Other Jews defended the suburbs as a place where young families were building new Jewish communal organizations, and in which the synagogue emerged as a more important institution than it had been in the city.\n\nThis debate was closely linked to a related one about the post war \"religious revival.\" United Synagogue Review, a magazine directed to the laity of the Conservative movement, posed that revival as a debate. A great many Jewish publications took up this debate as well. Were Jews actually becoming more observant and serious about Judaism or were there other motivations for synagogue membership? In this era, terms like \"country club\" Judaism or \"dancing school\" Judaism suggested that synagogue life was simply one more club that conformist suburbanites joined. Furthermore, parents required their children to go to religious school and attend a synagogue. Suburban Judaism was often called \"child oriented.\" Advocates for a vital post war Judaism countered that adult classes, young rabbis, and living among non-Jews allowed American born, new suburbanites to feel pride and excitement about their Judaism for the first time.\n\nThese debates signal that a remarkable transformation in what constituted American Jewish life was initiated in the 1940s. The fundamental definitions of what it meant to be a Jew and an American were no less contested than during the period of immigration at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\n### A Jewish Shrine at the Cemetery of Mainz?\n\nLucia Raspe\n\n### [\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Raspe.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/jewish-shrine-cemetery-mainz?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Raspe_a.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/jewish-shrine-cemetery-mainz?item=1)\n\nA headstone commemorating the eleventh-century liturgical poet R. Shim'on b. Yitzhak was unearthed during construction works in Mainz in 1922. Numerous similar finds indicate that it had been removed from its location and used for building purposes when the Jewish cemetery of that city was vandalized in 1438. Strangely, this particular epitaph was undated; it simply read \"This is the grave of _rabbana_ R. Shim'on bar Yitzhak. May his soul have eternal life.\" In both its shape and the execution of its inscription, the stone did not resemble those preserved from the eleventh century but seemed closer to the headstones produced in the twelfth or even thirteenth century. Apparently, then, this was not an original tombstone but a later replacement, intended to mark the grave after the original had been lost, perhaps during the persecutions of 1096. Similar memorial markers were found for Rabbenu Gershom _me'or hagola_ and the _payyetan_ R. Meshullam b. Kalonymos. The Jews of Mainz, it seems, felt a need to know exactly where these sages had been buried, though possibly only several generations after the original headstones had disappeared. Even after the Jews were expelled from Mainz in 1473, R. Shim'on's grave kept coming up in various hagiographic legends connected to his person, anchoring these tales in a contemporary reality. One narrator, apparently not from Mainz himself, mentions his own visit at his protagonist's grave, another tells us that there was a miraculous spring nearby. After a Jewish community was reestablished in the city in 1583, the grave was localized in a corner of the new cemetery adjacent to the plot used in medieval times; the surrounding area can be shown to have served as a preferred site for the burial of the privileged from the seventeenth century onward. Contemporary sources refer to the place as the \"cave\" of R. Shim'on, pointing to a certain degree of conflation with the talmudic legends about R. Shim'on bar Yohai. To some extent, then, a sacred grave located in the Holy Land had been transferred to Ashkenazic soil. Perhaps only by way of such an association were Ashkenazic Jews able to sacralize the space they were themselves inhabiting. Or had Ashkenaz indeed replaced the Holy Land in the minds of local Jews?\n\n### The Third Rabbinic Bible of 1547-1548\n\nElhanan Reiner\n\n### [\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Reiner.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/third-rabbinic-bible-1547-1548?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Reiner-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/third-rabbinic-bible-1547-1548?item=1)\n\nThe four volumes of the interpreted \"_\\`Esrim ve-'arba\\`ah_ \" (the “Twenty Four”, the traditional title to the whole Hebrew Bible) were printed three times in Venice by the end of the first half of the sixteenth century. These editions known as \"_Mikra'ot gedolot_\", a partial translation of the Latin name of the edition \"Magna Biblica Rabbinica\", are one of the most important and influential Hebrew compositions to have been printed. These editions mark a sharp turn in the history of Hebrew culture; they allowed the Jewish scholars as well as Christian Hebraists to read the ‘Rabbinically’ interpreted Bible as a whole.\n\nThe first edition of \"_Mikra'ot gedolot_\" was printed in Venice in the years 1515-1517, in the printing press of the Christian printer, Daniel Bomberg. It was edited by Felix Pratensis a convert who dedicated it to Pope Leo X. Seven years later, in the years 1525-1526 a second edition of \"_Mikra'ot gedolot_\" was printed in the same printing house but it was totally different from the former. It was edited by Jacob ben Hayyim ben Isaac ibn Adonijah, a Tunisian Jewish scholar who also in time converted to Christianity. This was the best and most important edition of the Hebrew Bible. As opposed to the first edition, this one succeeded in bringing the most accurate version of the Rabbinical Bible according to the ‘Masora’ with an apparatus accompanying it (‘_Masora_ magna’ and ‘_Masora_ Parva’). The Biblical text was surrounded by the Aramaic translation and by medieval interpretations. Besides Rashi, all of them were written by Sefaradi interpreters. Printing these interpretations around the text made them canonical also out of their original realm of culture.\n\nThe third and last edition printed in the first half of the sixteenth century was printed in the years 1547-1548 by Cornelio Edel Kind (Israel Cornelius Adelkind), one of the most important agents of the Jewish culture in the Early Modern Age, who received his expertise in the printing house of Daniel Bomberg. It seems to be the least interesting edition since not much was added to it that did not exist in the former ones. Yet as opposed to the first two editions that were accepted only gradually and mainly addressed Jewish scholars and Christian Hebraists, this edition appeared at a time when the idea of the whole ‘Rabbinically’ interpreted Bible had already been accepted by the Jewish public even in the Ashkenazi world. The third edition appeared in a cultural climate that had already been prepared by the two former editions and so it made its way easily to the Jewish _bate midrash_ as well as to the desks of learned Jews. Lengthy discussions about the Scriptures, among them discussions for and against the importance of learning them, took place in the second half of the sixteenth century in the Ashkenazi community due to the appearance of this third edition of the _Mikra'ot gedolot_, thus indicating its acceptance within the Jewish community. This is the reason I have chosen to present this edition from the collection of the library rather than its more famous former editions.\n\n### Ceremonies for Woman in Labor and Confinement\n\nShalom Sabar\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Sabar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nBooks on Jewish life and ceremonies, which were written by Christian Hebraists in 17th-18th cent. Europe, are at times accompanied by captivating black and white copper engravings prepared by professional contemporary engravers. Serving to enhance and illustrate the text on the facing pages, these illustrations provide rare glimpses into aspects of Jewish practices and daily life not available in Jewish art of the time. Despite some polemic overtones, the illustrations are generally accurate and filled with captivating and curious details on bygone Jewish customs and practices, Jewish quarters and synagogues, the interiors of Jewish homes and their contents, Jewish daily and festive dress, etc.\n\nThe attached cooper-engraving is taken from a book on Jewish ceremonies by Paul Christian Kirchner, the son of a Chazzan from Frankfurt a/Main, who converted to Christianity around 1715, and taught Judaism and Hebrew literature in various German institutions. The engraving depicts in three panels and four episodes events related to the first week in the life of a new Jewish male baby in early 18th c. Germany. The top panel shows two episodes at the actual time of childbirth: at left, the husband (marked with the letter a), the rabbi (b) and other figures are standing outside the room where the baby is going to be delivered, holding open books and reciting biblical passages believed to assist the safe delivery of the baby (e.g., Isaiah 54). At right is the interior of the \"birthing room\" — a room in the house where the delivery takes place: the birthing woman had been moved from her bed to the special delivery chair, while four women or midwives support and assist her. On the table at left is a Torah scroll (labeled c), which was brought from the Torah ark in the synagogue - in the belief that its holiness may protect the woman. On the wall are written several magic inscriptions in Hebrew — including the names of the three angels, who are supposed to ward off Lilith - the demon who is believed to kill babies at birth.\n\nTwo additional episodes are depicted in the two smaller panels underneath. As the custom has been that the birthing woman may not remain alone in the days following delivery, the left panel (labeled d) shows her in the company of visitors. At left is a group of men feasting around the table, and at right women who entertain the birthing woman. The last episode (labeled e) depicts the night before circumcision (in Yiddish Wachnacht) — Lilith's \"last chance\" to harm the mother or the baby. Men with open books stand around the bed of the woman, guarding her the entire night; she is lying in her bed with the baby safely in her arms; behind her large pillow is a sword with which she would fight Lilith. According to Kirchner, at midnight the mother would stand in the center of the room, take the sword and brandish it in four directions — as if she is attacking Lilith from whichever direction she may come.\n\n### Greener Grasses ...

The Dutch translation of the German edition illustrates very well the diasporic, \"routed\" character of the Jewish Enlightenment: The work of a scholar, living in Amsterdam, struggling for the re-admission of the Jews to England, was published in German as part of the debate on Jewish emancipation in Prussia and almost simultaneously transferred to the Netherlands.\n\nWhile we read in Menasseh ben Israel's work: \"Our captivity under the Mahometans is far more burdensome and grievous than under the Christians \\[…\\] as our nation have found experimentally,\" Mendelssohn is unable to sum up historical experience so neatly and adds a footnote, stating that \"\\[t\\]he number of Jews in the Mahometan states, probably, is greater than in the Christian. It is there, that they more frequently attain wealth and distinction by excelling as physicians, or even statesmen.\" The Ottoman Empire and Morocco are evoked as places that disrupt the prevalent order of hierarchies between West and East, North and South. They certainly did not present alternative political models, but they offered instances of diverging legal and political arrangements, which thoroughly questioned Eurocentric conceptions of rationalization and progress. From the East and the South it could be learned that the present situation in Prussia was not inevitable. The Maskilim drew a map of the diaspora, which showed many places, where some achievements could be observed, while \"civil improvement\" remained highly desirable — Berlin was just one of them.\n\n### The Avodah Genre and Its Popularity\n\nMichael Swartz\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Swartz.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nA papyrus fragment (Moscow, Pushkin Museum I.1.b 1028) from Palestine, dating to the end of the Byzantine period. The papyrus contains fragments of an _Avodah_ service for Yom Kippur. The Avodah, which was usually recited in the additional service (_musaf_) on the morning of Yom Kippur, narrates the sacrifice of expiation that took place in the Temple according to Leviticus 16 and the Mishnah tractate Yoma. Although early examples of the Avodah followed Mishnah Yoma's narration closely, the service developed by the fourth century into a complex example of synagogue poetry (_piyyut_). Avodah piyyutim included a lengthy preamble relating world history from creation to the selection of Aaron and his sons as priests, and went on to describe the sacrifice as performed by the High Priest. A distinctive feature of this genre is its glorification, in ornate poetry, of the High Priest as physically splendid and pious man who represents Israel before God in the Holy of Holies. The Avodah genre and its popularity in the synagogue testify to the persistence of interest in Israel's sacrificial system among Jews in the Rabbinic period, centuries after the destruction of the Temple.\n\n### Four Worlds of Kabbalah\n\nChava Weissler\n\n### [\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Weissler.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/four-worlds-kabbalah?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Weissler1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/four-worlds-kabbalah?item=1)\n\n\"Aleph: The Alliance for Jewish Renewal,\" is a contemporary Jewish movement that seeks to promote spirituality among American Jews. The movement draws upon and reinterprets the resources of the Jewish mystical tradition (Kabbalah and Hasidism). A central kabbalistic motif adapted by Renewal Jews is the idea that the cosmos is composed of Four Worlds, ranging from Atzilut (\"Emanation\": the divine world of the Sefirot, aspects of the Godhead), through Beriah (\"Creation\": the world of the Divine Chariot and the higher angels), and Yetzirah (\"Formation\": the world of angelic beings), to Assiyah (\"Making\": the physical world). As the first illustration shows, these worlds are associated with the letters of the Tetragrammaton, the four-letter Name of God. Renewal Jews stress the identification, found in some later Hasidic material, of these worlds with aspects of human life: spiritual communion, intellect, emotion, and physical being. Typically, Jewish Renewal services are conceptualized as a ladder of ascent through these four worlds, from physical being all the way to spiritual communion. Members of the Renewal movement also consider each of the worlds as holy, and all of them as essential to a balanced spiritual life. Thus, the letters, and the worlds, are also mapped onto the human form, as shown in the second illustration.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Abramowicz, Hirsz.** _Profiles of a lost world: memoirs of East European Jewish life before World War II._, Translated by Eva Zeitlin Dobkin; edited by Dina Abramowicz and Jeffrey Shandler; with introductions by David E.

The central question this year’s group addressed was the relationship between the prescriptive traditions mandated by the many strands of Judaism, and the actual practices of Jews. Historians were no more likely to assume that a single, normative Jewish tradition existed than anthropologists were, but the research questions, the methodologies, and the sources of evidence varied significantly from one researcher to another. We asked how to integrate them in order to have a more dynamic understanding of Judaism and Jewish culture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the key questions of the year was how to understand the relationship between sacred texts and practices, and as a corollary, under what social conditions texts become authoritative, to which communities and why. These questions allowed the seminar to focus on a particularly broad spectrum of Jewish life in both time and space: work was conducted on Jews in both the West and the Near East, in virtually every time period, and in Christian, Islamic, and secular societies, as well as in the modern State of Israel. We also reflected on an equally wide range of formulations of Judaism, which included, for example, mysticism, Sephardic saint veneration, Karaite and rabbinic rituals, pilgrimage, magic, Renewal, and nationalism.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These conversations led us to challenge some of the boundaries in the field that separated elite formulations from popular expressions, texts reflecting visual, oral, or embodied practices, and competing expressions of Jewish identity. We asked if an anthropology of Judaism could exist in the way that histories of Judaism do, and in so asking problematized the notion of a single Judaism or the dominance of text and history. The documents in this exhibition will reflect our rethinking of authority, textuality, and representation in the many expressions of Judaism that we study.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Riv-Ellen Prell, University of Minnesota\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-second-benjamin\">The Second Benjamin\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Dan Ben-Amos\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/second-benjamin?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Ben-Amos.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/second-benjamin?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Ben-Amos-h.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/second-benjamin?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Ben-Amos-e.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: right\">\u003Cstrong>ישראל בן יוסף בנימין, ספר מסעי ישראל, בו יסופר מאחינו בני ישראל בארצות אסיה ואפריקה, מצבם המדיני והמוסרי, מדותיהם דעותיהם ומנהגיהם, טובם ועשרם, ענים ומרודיהם, דבר לא נעדר, ככל אשר ראה בעיניו והתבונן על כל דרכיהם במסעותיו זה שנים רבות בארצות הקדם, הנוסע המפורסם בימינו אלה\u003C/strong>.\u003Cbr>תרגם דוד גארדאן. ליק, תרי\"ט 1859\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Israel Joseph Benjamin (1818-1864), who was born in Falticeni, Moldavia, became an explorer by default.

Fashioning himself as \u003Cem>Binyamin ha-Sheni\u003C/em>, (The Second Benjamin)---the medieval Benjamin of Tudela (12th century) being the first---he recorded his travels to the Jewish communities in the Near East, Central Asia, and North Africa in his book \u003Cem>Masey Jsrael\u003C/em>. The book appeared first in French as \u003Cem>Cinq annees de voyage en orient 1846-1851\u003C/em> (Paris: M.

Are there commonly agreed upon meanings assigned to ceremonial expressions that would be accepted in more than one culture, context and set of events? And if so how do historians interpret these expressions?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The empty space found around the heads of hierarchical figures is one such expression. A figure represented in this way visually emphasizes his or her importance. In a few “Jewish-National-Ceremonies” of the Middle Ages, this empty space signifies the leader among the people - such as the empty seat next to the Exchilarch and the space between the Gaon and the people before and after him. This feature is well-documented in non-Jewish chancelleries where official documents of the Caliphate were written with capacious line-spacing notably greater than the amount of space allotted for any regular office of the administration. We find the same phenomenon in the original writings of Jewish leaders. In addition, a Jewish leader’s signature usually will be found at the end of a document separated from the others by a generous empty space. This spacing pattern points to the hierarchy of the signatories (if more than one name is signed) or to the importance of an individual signatory. Such documents can easily be found in our CAJS collection, among them Halper 365 [Fustat. 1066-1108?], copied by a Hillel ben Eli, in which a certain Sitt al-Dar, wife of Sedaka ha-Levi, promises to comply with the stipulation of her late brother (also named Sedaka), that she should provide for her mother and for her mother’s funeral. At bottom, the witnesses Yosef ben Elazar ha-Mumheh, Elazar ben Eli ha-Kohen, Yosef ben Nisim ha-Kohen, and Yakhin ben Avraham sign the document, their signatures appearing in the order and length respective to each witness’ status.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"virtual-martyrs\">Virtual Martyrs\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Ra’anan (Abusch) Boustan\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/virtual-martyrs?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Boustan.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/virtual-martyrs?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Boustan1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/virtual-martyrs?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Boustan2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Title page of \u003Cem>Sefer Yihus ha-Tsadikim\u003C/em> (\u003Cem>Genealogy of the Righteous\u003C/em>), edited by Abraham Moshe Lunz (Jerusalem, 1896). This text, likely assembled in something resembling its final form in the late fifteenth century, is a fully developed itinerarium for Jewish pilgrims to the Holy Land. Several pages from a first edition edited by Solomon ben Yohai in Constantinople, 1515-1520 are preserved. The oldest extant edition was printed by Gershom ben Asher of Scarmela in Mantua, 1561 and reprinted in the edition pictured here by Abraham Moshe Lunz, the blind researcher and collector of medieval Jewish geographic literature about Palestine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This text represents the culmination of a long evolutionary process, which shaped Jewish pilgrimage practice in the Middle Ages (on which see Elchanan Reiner, “Traditions of Holy Places in Medieval Palestine: Oral versus Written,” in \u003Cem>Offerings from Jerusalem: Portrayals of Holy Places by Jewish Artists\u003C/em>, ed.

The creator(s) of this text collected and edited numerous legal and legendary traditions from earlier rabbinic (and para-rabbinic?) sources into what might best be called “hagiographic catenae.” These catenae are to be recited at the tombs of sages as well as at such holy sites as the ruins of the Jerusalem Temple. A hagiography of the R. Ishmael ben Elisha (buried at Kefar Kana) appears on pp. 85-87; this narrative is constructed from: the opening of the martyrology in MekhY, Nezikin 18 on Exod 22:22; sections of the “martyr-narrative” in Hekhalot Rabati (Synopse, ”107-109, 111); parts of the “David-apocalypse” (Synopse, ”122-126); and the beginning of the havurah-account in Hekhalot Rabati (Synopse, ”203). Different hagiographic accounts of “R. Ishmael” (buried at Farod) and “R. Ishmael ben Kohen Gadol” (buried at Shizur) appear on pp. 62-63 and 68-69 respectively, thereby attesting to the dynamism and creativity of this genre of literature. Various legendary traditions concerning “Rabban Gamaliel, who was among the ten martyrs” are collected on p. 88.

Menasseh ben Israel (1604-1657). The work is a sustained attempt to argue for the eternality of the soul against skeptics who argued that such a belief could not be maintained for philosophical (and scriptural) reasons. To confute the skeptics, Menasseh marshalled evidence from a wide range of sources to prove that souls endure after bodily death. Biblical passages, classical rabbinic literature, Gentile scholarship, and kabbalistic texts are all adduced to make this case. On top of them all, Menasseh adds what he considered to be the the best empirical evidence of the existence of a spirit world: contemporary ethnographic accounts (often travelers’ reports from the New World) and stories of spirit possession. In an era when belief in God was being questioned by the likes of Spinoza—himself a former pupil of Rabbi Menasseh—eye-witness accounts of demonic activity furnished an indirect proof for His existence in the hip empiricist language of the day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"writing-orality\">Writing Orality\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Talya Fishman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/writing-orality?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Fishman.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/writing-orality?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Fishman1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Writing in twelfth century France, at a time when variant manuscripts of the Babylonian Talmud were in circulation, the most famous talmudic glossator, the Tosafist Rabbenu Jacob ben Meir Tam, attacked the rampant practice of textual emendation of rabbinic writings in his Introduction to \u003Cem>Sefer ha-Yashar\u003C/em>, i.e., “The Book of Probity.” This critical perspective points to the emergence of two new historical conditions: (a) Written texts of the Oral Torah were no longer be regarded as \u003Cem>aides de memoire\u003C/em>, for had that been the case, lexical variants would not be a cause for concern.

His grandfather, originally from Genoa, settled in Tripoli, while his father, a merchant, died in a shipwreck and the family lost all its wealth. Growing up with limited means, Ha-Cohen became an autodidact, persistently seeking Jewish and general knowledge. Influenced by the Hebrew \u003Cem>haskala\u003C/em>, he authored a book on the history, institutions, and customs of the Jews of his native land, calling the book \u003Cem>Highid Mordekhai\u003C/em> (Jerusalem, Ben-Zvi Institute, 1978). In 1906 he served as a guide to Russian-born Nahum Slouschz, a Sorbonne-trained orientalist sent on a mission to Tripoli by the Alliance Israilite Universelle. Ha-Cohen guided Slouschz as they visited small Jewish communities in the Tripolitanian hinterland, including mountain areas where Berber-speaking groups lived. \u003Cem>Highid Mordekhai\u003C/em> contains rich descriptions of these communities, which in many ways are more valuable than the ethnography provided by Slouschz in his publications. This ethnographic material appears in English as \u003Cem>The Book of Mordechai\u003C/em> (London, Darf, 1993, ed. Harvey E. Goldberg). Later in life, Ha-Cohen moved to Benghazi where he became a member of the rabbinic court.

The versions of this work found in manuscript form (which sometimes contain questions not found in the published edition) suggest that it enjoyed a degree of popularity.

These rescue projects, such as “Operation Magic Carpet” that brought Jews from Yemen and “Operation Ezra and Nehemia” that trasported Iraqi Jews, both in the early 1950s, or “Operations Moses” and “Operation Solomon” that transported Ethiopian Jews 1984-5 and 1991, respectively, have become part of Israel’s foundation mythology. They are also part of a trans-communal narrative of peoplehood within the Jewish world that is grounded in shared belonging and mutual commitment. My study attempts to re-capture the human and national dramas depicted in hegemonic versions of “salvage immigration” narratives, but also attends to the ways in which they have been renegotiated and contested by various participants on the Israeli cultural scene over the years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"pulp-pilgrims\">Pulp Pilgrims\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Oran Kosansky\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/pulp-pilgrims?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Kosansky_Shanot.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/pulp-pilgrims?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Kosansky_Pinto.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In Jewish Morocco, the twentieth century witnessed the emergence and transformation of new forms of hagiographic literature dedicated to recounting the lives and miracles of deceased, sainted rabbis. These texts, and the social contexts in which they have been animated, demonstrate the ways in which Judaic practice in Morocco is situated at the intersection between authoritative rabbinic traditions and historical developments. The Hebrew text depicted here is the cover of a hagiographic volume entitled \u003Cem>Shenot Haim\u003C/em>. Published in 1961 as a Judeo-Arabic translation of a Hebrew original, \u003Cem>Shenot Haim\u003C/em> deals predominantly with a single rabbinic lineage whose past members are buried in shrines which remain the object of pilgrimage. The text is constituted as a hybrid genre drawing on European Jewish literary precedents, rabbinic textual forms of authorization, and local language practices. \u003Cem>Shenot Haim\u003C/em> is crafted, and in many cases is popularly recognized, as a form of authoritative rabbinic exegesis through which Moroccan hagiographic and pilgrimage traditions are constituted in resolutely Judaic terms.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Despite the obvious formal differences between the Hebrew text and the French comic strip, the latter published at the end of the twentieth century, there are significant continuities between the two. Not only do both deal with the same saint (Rabbi Haim Pinto); the narrative of the comic strip is in fact taken almost verbatim from an episode recounted in \u003Cem>Shenot Haim\u003C/em>. Moreover, both texts were produced under the guidance of living members of the Pinto lineage who, in their respective times, exploited current technologies and popular idioms to disseminate their message to the widest possible audience. Finally, insofar as both these and similar texts continue to circulate, they contribute to the ongoing vitality of hagiographic and pilgrimage traditions in Morocco and its Jewish diaspora.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"how-to-how-to\">How “to how to”\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jack Kugelmass\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Kugelmass.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Kugelmass1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>“How to” books are a strikingly productive genre of American Jewish culture.

While some of their sacred traditions concerning Jerusalem and its particular holy sites are held only by believers of one religion, many others are common to two religions or even to all three. These common traditions were sometimes a basis for dialogue, but more often they became a bone of contention between the believers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Mount of Olives, situated to the east of Jerusalem, is an outstanding example of the complex nature of religious processes and religious dialogue revealed in sacred spaces. For believers of all three religions the Mount is charged with messianic tension as the arena of eschatological events at the End of Time, and as bearing signs of messianic promises in the past and in the present. All three groups of believers agreed that the Mount would be the stage of Resurrection and Judgment, where the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth would be launched. They disagreed over the details of the myth: Who would be the Messiah — the Judge, where is the precise site of his future appearance, and who will be redeemed. Thus, my project is a comparative historical research of the traditions and rituals of the three religions relating to one and the same place — the Mount of Olives, using literary, historical, and anthropological investigation of religious practices.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"suburban-judaism\">Suburban Judaism\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Riv-Ellen Prell\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-4\">\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/suburban-judaism?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Prell.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/suburban-judaism?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Prell1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/suburban-judaism?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Prell3.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Following World War II American Jews living in major urban centers underwent two related changes. A significant number of them (there are no exact figures) moved to the suburbs and there they joined synagogues. Six hundred new synagogues were built in the period immediately following the end of the war. This period also had the highest rate of synagogue affiliation, about 52%. American Jews made choices similar to other whites in this regard, however a far greater percentage of Jews moved to the suburbs in comparison to other religious and ethnic group.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The impact of suburbanization on Jews was a subject regularly debated in Jewish journals and magazines of the time. Intellectuals, social workers, writers, rabbis, lay leaders and ordinary Jews wrote about the differences between the urban environment where Jewish life was “natural,” versus the suburban world in which Jews were a minority and the streets reflected nothing of a public Jewish life. Other Jews defended the suburbs as a place where young families were building new Jewish communal organizations, and in which the synagogue emerged as a more important institution than it had been in the city.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This debate was closely linked to a related one about the post war “religious revival.” United Synagogue Review, a magazine directed to the laity of the Conservative movement, posed that revival as a debate. A great many Jewish publications took up this debate as well. Were Jews actually becoming more observant and serious about Judaism or were there other motivations for synagogue membership? In this era, terms like “country club” Judaism or “dancing school” Judaism suggested that synagogue life was simply one more club that conformist suburbanites joined. Furthermore, parents required their children to go to religious school and attend a synagogue. Suburban Judaism was often called “child oriented.” Advocates for a vital post war Judaism countered that adult classes, young rabbis, and living among non-Jews allowed American born, new suburbanites to feel pride and excitement about their Judaism for the first time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These debates signal that a remarkable transformation in what constituted American Jewish life was initiated in the 1940s. The fundamental definitions of what it meant to be a Jew and an American were no less contested than during the period of immigration at the turn of the twentieth century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"a-jewish-shrine-at-the-cemetery-of-mainz\">A Jewish Shrine at the Cemetery of Mainz?\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Lucia Raspe\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-5\">\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/jewish-shrine-cemetery-mainz?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Raspe.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/jewish-shrine-cemetery-mainz?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Raspe_a.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A headstone commemorating the eleventh-century liturgical poet R. Shim’on b. Yitzhak was unearthed during construction works in Mainz in 1922. Numerous similar finds indicate that it had been removed from its location and used for building purposes when the Jewish cemetery of that city was vandalized in 1438. Strangely, this particular epitaph was undated; it simply read “This is the grave of \u003Cem>rabbana\u003C/em> R. Shim’on bar Yitzhak. May his soul have eternal life.” In both its shape and the execution of its inscription, the stone did not resemble those preserved from the eleventh century but seemed closer to the headstones produced in the twelfth or even thirteenth century. Apparently, then, this was not an original tombstone but a later replacement, intended to mark the grave after the original had been lost, perhaps during the persecutions of 1096. Similar memorial markers were found for Rabbenu Gershom \u003Cem>me’or hagola\u003C/em> and the \u003Cem>payyetan\u003C/em> R. Meshullam b. Kalonymos. The Jews of Mainz, it seems, felt a need to know exactly where these sages had been buried, though possibly only several generations after the original headstones had disappeared. Even after the Jews were expelled from Mainz in 1473, R. Shim’on’s grave kept coming up in various hagiographic legends connected to his person, anchoring these tales in a contemporary reality. One narrator, apparently not from Mainz himself, mentions his own visit at his protagonist’s grave, another tells us that there was a miraculous spring nearby. After a Jewish community was reestablished in the city in 1583, the grave was localized in a corner of the new cemetery adjacent to the plot used in medieval times; the surrounding area can be shown to have served as a preferred site for the burial of the privileged from the seventeenth century onward. Contemporary sources refer to the place as the “cave” of R. Shim’on, pointing to a certain degree of conflation with the talmudic legends about R. Shim’on bar Yohai. To some extent, then, a sacred grave located in the Holy Land had been transferred to Ashkenazic soil. Perhaps only by way of such an association were Ashkenazic Jews able to sacralize the space they were themselves inhabiting. Or had Ashkenaz indeed replaced the Holy Land in the minds of local Jews?\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-third-rabbinic-bible-of-1547-1548\">The Third Rabbinic Bible of 1547-1548\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Elhanan Reiner\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-6\">\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/third-rabbinic-bible-1547-1548?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Reiner.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/third-rabbinic-bible-1547-1548?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Reiner-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The four volumes of the interpreted “\u003Cem>`Esrim ve-‘arba`ah\u003C/em> ” (the “Twenty Four”, the traditional title to the whole Hebrew Bible) were printed three times in Venice by the end of the first half of the sixteenth century. These editions known as “\u003Cem>Mikra’ot gedolot\u003C/em>”, a partial translation of the Latin name of the edition “Magna Biblica Rabbinica”, are one of the most important and influential Hebrew compositions to have been printed.

Seven years later, in the years 1525-1526 a second edition of “\u003Cem>Mikra’ot gedolot\u003C/em>” was printed in the same printing house but it was totally different from the former. It was edited by Jacob ben Hayyim ben Isaac ibn Adonijah, a Tunisian Jewish scholar who also in time converted to Christianity. This was the best and most important edition of the Hebrew Bible. As opposed to the first edition, this one succeeded in bringing the most accurate version of the Rabbinical Bible according to the ‘Masora’ with an apparatus accompanying it (‘\u003Cem>Masora\u003C/em> magna’ and ‘\u003Cem>Masora\u003C/em> Parva’). The Biblical text was surrounded by the Aramaic translation and by medieval interpretations. Besides Rashi, all of them were written by Sefaradi interpreters. Printing these interpretations around the text made them canonical also out of their original realm of culture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The third and last edition printed in the first half of the sixteenth century was printed in the years 1547-1548 by Cornelio Edel Kind (Israel Cornelius Adelkind), one of the most important agents of the Jewish culture in the Early Modern Age, who received his expertise in the printing house of Daniel Bomberg. It seems to be the least interesting edition since not much was added to it that did not exist in the former ones. Yet as opposed to the first two editions that were accepted only gradually and mainly addressed Jewish scholars and Christian Hebraists, this edition appeared at a time when the idea of the whole ‘Rabbinically’ interpreted Bible had already been accepted by the Jewish public even in the Ashkenazi world. The third edition appeared in a cultural climate that had already been prepared by the two former editions and so it made its way easily to the Jewish \u003Cem>bate midrash\u003C/em> as well as to the desks of learned Jews. Lengthy discussions about the Scriptures, among them discussions for and against the importance of learning them, took place in the second half of the sixteenth century in the Ashkenazi community due to the appearance of this third edition of the \u003Cem>Mikra’ot gedolot\u003C/em>, thus indicating its acceptance within the Jewish community. This is the reason I have chosen to present this edition from the collection of the library rather than its more famous former editions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ceremonies-for-woman-in-labor-and-confinement\">Ceremonies for Woman in Labor and Confinement\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Shalom Sabar\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-7\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Sabar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Books on Jewish life and ceremonies, which were written by Christian Hebraists in 17th-18th cent. Europe, are at times accompanied by captivating black and white copper engravings prepared by professional contemporary engravers. Serving to enhance and illustrate the text on the facing pages, these illustrations provide rare glimpses into aspects of Jewish practices and daily life not available in Jewish art of the time. Despite some polemic overtones, the illustrations are generally accurate and filled with captivating and curious details on bygone Jewish customs and practices, Jewish quarters and synagogues, the interiors of Jewish homes and their contents, Jewish daily and festive dress, etc.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The attached cooper-engraving is taken from a book on Jewish ceremonies by Paul Christian Kirchner, the son of a Chazzan from Frankfurt a/Main, who converted to Christianity around 1715, and taught Judaism and Hebrew literature in various German institutions. The engraving depicts in three panels and four episodes events related to the first week in the life of a new Jewish male baby in early 18th c. Germany. The top panel shows two episodes at the actual time of childbirth: at left, the husband (marked with the letter a), the rabbi (b) and other figures are standing outside the room where the baby is going to be delivered, holding open books and reciting biblical passages believed to assist the safe delivery of the baby (e.g., Isaiah 54). At right is the interior of the “birthing room” — a room in the house where the delivery takes place: the birthing woman had been moved from her bed to the special delivery chair, while four women or midwives support and assist her. On the table at left is a Torah scroll (labeled c), which was brought from the Torah ark in the synagogue - in the belief that its holiness may protect the woman. On the wall are written several magic inscriptions in Hebrew — including the names of the three angels, who are supposed to ward off Lilith - the demon who is believed to kill babies at birth.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Two additional episodes are depicted in the two smaller panels underneath. As the custom has been that the birthing woman may not remain alone in the days following delivery, the left panel (labeled d) shows her in the company of visitors. At left is a group of men feasting around the table, and at right women who entertain the birthing woman. The last episode (labeled e) depicts the night before circumcision (in Yiddish Wachnacht) — Lilith’s “last chance” to harm the mother or the baby. Men with open books stand around the bed of the woman, guarding her the entire night; she is lying in her bed with the baby safely in her arms; behind her large pillow is a sword with which she would fight Lilith. According to Kirchner, at midnight the mother would stand in the center of the room, take the sword and brandish it in four directions — as if she is attacking Lilith from whichever direction she may come.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"greener-grasses--between-west-and-east\">Greener Grasses … Between West and East\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Andrea Schatz\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-8\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Schatz.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Menasseh ben Israel’s short treatise \u003Cem>Vindiciae Judaeorum\u003C/em> (London, 1656) was translated into German by Marcus Herz and published with an introduction and a number of footnotes by Moses Mendelssohn in 1782. The Dutch translation of the German edition illustrates very well the diasporic, “routed” character of the Jewish Enlightenment: The work of a scholar, living in Amsterdam, struggling for the re-admission of the Jews to England, was published in German as part of the debate on Jewish emancipation in Prussia and almost simultaneously transferred to the Netherlands.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While we read in Menasseh ben Israel’s work: “Our captivity under the Mahometans is far more burdensome and grievous than under the Christians […] as our nation have found experimentally,” Mendelssohn is unable to sum up historical experience so neatly and adds a footnote, stating that “[t]he number of Jews in the Mahometan states, probably, is greater than in the Christian. It is there, that they more frequently attain wealth and distinction by excelling as physicians, or even statesmen.” The Ottoman Empire and Morocco are evoked as places that disrupt the prevalent order of hierarchies between West and East, North and South. They certainly did not present alternative political models, but they offered instances of diverging legal and political arrangements, which thoroughly questioned Eurocentric conceptions of rationalization and progress. From the East and the South it could be learned that the present situation in Prussia was not inevitable. The Maskilim drew a map of the diaspora, which showed many places, where some achievements could be observed, while “civil improvement” remained highly desirable — Berlin was just one of them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-avodah-genre-and-its-popularity\">The Avodah Genre and Its Popularity\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Michael Swartz\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-9\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Swartz.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>A papyrus fragment (Moscow, Pushkin Museum I.1.b 1028) from Palestine, dating to the end of the Byzantine period. The papyrus contains fragments of an \u003Cem>Avodah\u003C/em> service for Yom Kippur. The Avodah, which was usually recited in the additional service (\u003Cem>musaf\u003C/em>) on the morning of Yom Kippur, narrates the sacrifice of expiation that took place in the Temple according to Leviticus 16 and the Mishnah tractate Yoma. Although early examples of the Avodah followed Mishnah Yoma’s narration closely, the service developed by the fourth century into a complex example of synagogue poetry (\u003Cem>piyyut\u003C/em>). Avodah piyyutim included a lengthy preamble relating world history from creation to the selection of Aaron and his sons as priests, and went on to describe the sacrifice as performed by the High Priest. A distinctive feature of this genre is its glorification, in ornate poetry, of the High Priest as physically splendid and pious man who represents Israel before God in the Holy of Holies. The Avodah genre and its popularity in the synagogue testify to the persistence of interest in Israel’s sacrificial system among Jews in the Rabbinic period, centuries after the destruction of the Temple.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"four-worlds-of-kabbalah\">Four Worlds of Kabbalah\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Chava Weissler\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-10\">\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/four-worlds-kabbalah?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Weissler.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/challenging-boundaries/four-worlds-kabbalah?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901172755im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Weissler1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Aleph: The Alliance for Jewish Renewal,” is a contemporary Jewish movement that seeks to promote spirituality among American Jews. The movement draws upon and reinterprets the resources of the Jewish mystical tradition (Kabbalah and Hasidism). A central kabbalistic motif adapted by Renewal Jews is the idea that the cosmos is composed of Four Worlds, ranging from Atzilut (“Emanation”: the divine world of the Sefirot, aspects of the Godhead), through Beriah (“Creation”: the world of the Divine Chariot and the higher angels), and Yetzirah (“Formation”: the world of angelic beings), to Assiyah (“Making”: the physical world). As the first illustration shows, these worlds are associated with the letters of the Tetragrammaton, the four-letter Name of God. Renewal Jews stress the identification, found in some later Hasidic material, of these worlds with aspects of human life: spiritual communion, intellect, emotion, and physical being. Typically, Jewish Renewal services are conceptualized as a ladder of ascent through these four worlds, from physical being all the way to spiritual communion. Members of the Renewal movement also consider each of the worlds as holy, and all of them as essential to a balanced spiritual life. Thus, the letters, and the worlds, are also mapped onto the human form, as shown in the second illustration.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Abramowicz, Hirsz.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Profiles of a lost world: memoirs of East European Jewish life before World War II.\u003C/em>, Translated by Eva Zeitlin Dobkin; edited by Dina Abramowicz and Jeffrey Shandler; with introductions by David E.

In time, modern rabbinical seminaries in central Europe and universities in France, England, the US and Israel would provide new and necessary forms of institutionalization. The needs and strategies of the discipline and its political and cultural functions varied in different countries and political contexts. The turn to history in the 19th century fundamentally recast the nature of Jewish thinking in Europe and beyond, influencing even those who challenged or rejected the dominance and mandate of historical-critical scholarship. The predominant narrative in this history of the academic study of Jews and Judaism is that of the _Wissenschaft des Judentums_ (WdJ), which fulfilled crucial cultural, political, and religious functions in its day, and which, despite recent scholarship, remains to be fully contextualized. This past year's Fellows explored critical questions about how academic categories and methodologies have framed how Jews and Judaism are understood—be they in parallel with Christian theology, political science, history, classical philology, or in relation to traditional learning contexts. In this exhibition, we find examples of the fruits of their intellectual labors in reconstructing the history of the academic study of Judaism from these early, diverse seedbeds.\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### The Making of the World Congress of Jewish Studies (Kenesiyah gedolah le-hokhmat yisra’el)\n\nNatalia Aleksiun\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aleksiun-proposal1-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/making-world-congress-jewish-studies-kenesiyah?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aleksiun-proposal2-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/making-world-congress-jewish-studies-kenesiyah?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aleksiun-proposal3-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/making-world-congress-jewish-studies-kenesiyah?item=2)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aleksiun-proposal4-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/making-world-congress-jewish-studies-kenesiyah?item=3)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aleksiun-proposal5-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/making-world-congress-jewish-studies-kenesiyah?item=4)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aleksiun-proposal6-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/making-world-congress-jewish-studies-kenesiyah?item=5)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aleksiun-Letter1-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/making-world-congress-jewish-studies-kenesiyah?item=6)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aleksiun-Letter2-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/making-world-congress-jewish-studies-kenesiyah?item=7)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aleksiun-Letter3-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/making-world-congress-jewish-studies-kenesiyah?item=8)\n\nFollowing a festive inauguration of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1925, Jewish scholars who formed the Governing Council of the Institute of Jewish Studies discussed the need to create an international organization representing all aspects of Jewish studies. A member of the Council - Mojżesz Schorr (1874-1941)—a distinguished historian and a Warsaw rabbi—took the initial steps in designing the future “World Congress of Jewish Studies.” In the summer of 1928, he circulated his ideas among leading Jewish intellectuals worldwide. Schorr argued that such a congress had become necessary given the rapid growth of the field and the “spiritual renaissance of the Jewish people.” Indeed, like other full-fledged scholarly disciplines, Jewish studies merited an organized forum.\n\nCyrus Adler (1863-1940)—one of the addressees of the proposal—voiced numerous reservations or, as he put it in his letter to Schorr in January 1929, “I do not find myself very much in sympathy with this idea.” Pointing to the limited financial resources available to Jewish scholars worldwide and in particular the lack of “Government patronage,” Adler opted for focusing resources on already existing scholarly initiatives. Moreover, he suggested a more grass-roots approach, with “local academies” serving as the organizing principle for Jewish studies. While Adler’s response focuses on the structural weaknesses of Jewish studies and its practitioners, the debate with Schorr allows us to see the maturing of international academic networks and the influence of institutional models borrowed from other, more established fields.\n\n### Cardoso, _Philosophia Libera_\n\nAndrew Berns\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/berns900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe physician and philosopher Isaac Cardoso (d. 1683), who began life as a converso in Spain and died a professing Jew in Italy, published a lavish folio volume in 1673 entitled _Philosophia Libera_. Cardoso had received his medical education in Salamanca, and published his book in one of Europe's most important printing centers: Venice. The book is a schematic survey and critique of the history of philosophy, and contains much information on the Jewish origins of philosophy and science. Two scriptural quotations are prominently featured on the frontispiece. One is directly related to the book's theme, and is taken from the thirty-sixth chapter of Job. Elihu proclaims the majesty of God''s creation: \"All people have looked on it; everyone watches it from far away.\" Cardoso's aim was to \"look on it\" from a much closer perspective. Indeed _Philosophia Libera_ does so and offers a fine justification for studying nature: \"we shall investigate Nature and its Founder, so that from the world and its multitude of things, as if by a ladder, with enlightened and instructed mind, we may be lifted to God its Maker; for His creatures are the ladder by which we ascend to God, the organ with which we praise God, and the school in which we learn God.\" There is perhaps no better summary of Cardoso's mission, as well as that of scientifically-inclined Jews in Italy and Spain from the Middle Ages through the Enlightenment.\n\n### Honoring a Founder: From the Life of Leopold Zunz, edited by Siegmund Maybaum\n\nAmos Bitzan\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/bitzan900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn 1894, on the centenary of the birth of Leopold Zunz (1794-1886), the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums in Berlin, published its 12th annual report together with a supplement devoted to the great scholar whom the institution saw as its founder. Zunz had called for the revival of scholarship devoted to Jewish literature in a famous 1818 essay, \"On Rabbinic Literature.\" The wealth of scholarly publications that appeared in the following decades testify to the reception of his call. Although most of Zunz's scholarly oeuvre was decidedly not popular and sometimes difficult to digest, Zunz's persona and life were represented in popular terms after his death. This 1894 publication by Maybaum (1844-1919), himself a great scholar of Jewish antiquity and late antiquity, gathered some of Zunz's personal correspondence from the years between 1818 and 1839, when Zunz struggled to secure a permanent position for himself as a rabbi or communal teacher. The correspondence consists mainly of his applications for candidacy and requests for assistance as well as a few rejections and negative appraisals sent by or about him. In Maybaum's words, \"these failed attempts ... led him to the realization that his nature was suited only for work in complete independence\" (p. 2). That is to say, they mark Zunz's turn to Wissenschaft (scholarship) alone and for its own sake.\n\nThe attached image is from Maybaum p. 11 and consists of Maybaum's reproduction of a chart that Zunz prepared in which he documented all the sermons he had given at the \"German Synagogue in Berlin.\" The table lists the date of the sermon and the verse(s) that it discussed.\n\n### Elia Benamozegh and the printing of Levantine Jewish scholarship\n\nClémence Boulouque\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/boulouque900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nAn Italian rabbi, kabbalist, and thinker of Moroccan descent who lived in the Tuscan port city of Livorno, Elia Benamozegh (1823-1900) authored an abundance of works, encompassing exegesis, historical studies and various newspaper contributions, written in Hebrew, Italian and French. Through his posthumous masterwork, _Israel and Humanity_ (1914), he significantly influenced the Christian-Jewish dialogue in Europe and rekindled the Noachide movement. In the books penned in French or Italian, brimming with references to Western philosophy and literature, he never made mention of his Oriental roots and rarely cited Sephardic contemporary authors. Yet his publishing activities situated him in the Middle East and North-African world. If various prayer books, spanning all Sephardic rituals, arguably signal a more commercial side of his activity, Benamozegh also showed perceptiveness with regards to his selection of Sephardic thinkers.\n\nThe catalogue of the volumes he published demonstrate his commitment to foster a sense of identity which embraces tradition in a modern key, as well as a sense of unity of Oriental Jews. And, because his endeavors displeased some more conservative actors, Benamozegh seems to have used his press as a way to publish his like-minded contemporaries, thus mapping out a landscape of modern Sephardic thought. This is certainly the case for the haggadah revised by Shelomoh Bekhor Hutsin (1843-1892) which Benamozegh published in 1887. This book, printed in Judeo-Arabic, Arabic, and Hebrew, according to the Baghdadi minhag (liturgical custom), lies at the juncture of tradition and modernity. Hutsin was a student of rabbi Abdallah Somekh (1813-1902) and a graduate of the very selective Yeshiva set up by Somekh, called Beth Zilkha, from which all the graduates became community leaders. Hutsin wrote liturgical works, numerous articles and was an advocate of a version of Jewish enlightenment that was respectful of Jewish values and modern culture. In 1863, Barukh Moshe Misrahi established the first press of Baghdad. In 1882 the activities ceased, only to be resumed by Hutsin in 1888– this is exactly in the interim that Benamozegh published this Haggadah. This cooperation seems to show that Benamozegh was in the know about both the business side but also the life of ideas in Baghdad; it is evidence of the sustained intense intellectual contacts in the Mediterranean and the Levant—and of a different kind of Enlightenment.\n\n### Abraham Geiger and Quranic scholarship\n\nDaniel Boušek\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/bousek900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn 1833, Abraham Geiger published _Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judenthume aufgenommen?_ (“What did Muhammad borrow from Judaism?”). The essay, originally written in Latin and submitted to the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Bonn the previous year, was awarded a prize by the Faculty in August of 1832. Geiger's work has rightly been judged a methodological breakthrough and a turning point in European scholarship about the origins and sources of Islam. Geiger was the first scholar to \"historize\" the Qurʾān, i.e. to read the text critically in light of the historical contexts in which it was written. For example, Geiger scrutinizes the vocabulary of the Qur’ān in order to identify words and ideas which were, as he assumed, borrowed from Judaism and earlier Jewish traditions. Although some of Geiger's assumptions may today appear naïve and judgmental, his major contribution was to approach the relationship between the two religions conceptually rather than polemically, and systematically rather than haphazardly. The book aroused something of a stir among Geiger's Christian colleagues by portraying the Prophet Muhammad as \"a sincere religious enthusiast (schwärmer) who was himself convinced of his divine mission\" and not as a skilled imposter and charlatan, as viewed by Silvestre de Sacy, the leading Arabist of the time. But the main importance of Geiger's _Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judenthume aufgenommen?_ lies in the fact that it has for the first time posed questions that stand in the center of Qur’ānic research till today.\n\n### Zacharias Frankel, Darkhe ha-mishnah ve-darkhe ha-sefarim ha-nilvim eleha Tosefta, Mekhilta, Sifra, Sifre. Helek rishon: petihah leha-Mishnah, Leipzig 1859\n\nAndreas Brämer\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/bramer1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nDuring the 1850s the religious spectrum of German Jewry encompassed various Orthodox orientations, from an Old Orthodoxy hostile to emancipation and modernity, to a Neo-Orthodoxy that combined a strict Torah-true religious adherence to the Law with an affirmative attitude toward German culture and the German nation. On the other hand, there were radical and moderate versions of a Reform Judaism that looked at tradition through the prism of historical criticism, and evaluated conceptions of faith and its practice using yardsticks calibrated in terms of the cultural and social parameters of the non-Jewish environment. Between Reform Judaism and Orthodoxy, representatives of a third religious current began to distance themselves from Reform and Orthodoxy and express their views in the public arena. Prominent among them was Zacharias Frankel, born in Prague in 1801. After obtaining his doctorate in Budapest in 1830, Frankel was appointed rabbi (_Kreisrabbiner_) in Leitmeritz (Litoměřice) in Bohemia, before the Dresden Jewish Community elected him as chief rabbi in 1836. In Saxony he served until 1854, establishing a reputation as a \"moderate reformer.\" He then moved to Breslau after having been appointed director of the newly founded Jewish Theological Seminary, the first modern rabbinical training institute on German soil.\n\nAs one of the pioneers of modern _Wissenschaft des Judentums_, Frankel gained fame mainly as a historian of Jewish religious law. In his scholarship he freely adapted concepts originally developed by Friedrich Carl von Savigny and other scholars of the German Historical School of Jurisprudence. In 1859 Heinrich Hunger, a German non Jewish publishing house, seated in Leipzig, printed Frankel’s magnus opum, a scientific introduction to the Mishna. The author initially conceptualized the book as the first part in a series of works dedicated to the history of Tannaitic halakhic literature. However, no further volumes were ever to be published.\n\nFrankel’s book _Darkhe ha-mishnah_ is considered a milestone in modern Jewish scholarship. There also is good reason to call the research he presented \"counter-history\" because Frankel used key texts of Orthodox Judaism against Orthodoxy in order to corroborate his view of a tradition that had not been revealed at Sinai but developed over the course of history and by that process had gained sacred status. Frankel was severely attacked by conservative religious circles who perceived his introduction as a threat—partly because of its use as a textbook at the seminary, but also due to the circumstance that it was written in Hebrew in order to aim at a traditionalist audience in Eastern Europe.\n\n### Celebrating Maimonides’ 800th Birthday in Córdoba\n\nMichal Rose Friedman\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/friedman-celebration1-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-cordoba?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/friedman-celebration2-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-cordoba?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/friedman-celebration3-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-cordoba?item=2)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/friedman-fromadler-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-cordoba?item=3)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/friedman-telegram-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-cordoba?item=4)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/friedman-telegramresponse-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-cordoba?item=5)\n\nIn 1935, elaborate commemorative events took place throughout the world marking the octocentennial of the birth of Maimonides (Rabbi Moses bar Maimon 1135-1204), the medieval Jewish communal leader, philosopher, and physician. With Cyrus Adler at its helm, Dropsie College in Philadelphia took a leading role in the organization of the official commemorative events in the United States. In a letter, dated December 7th, 1934, found in the Adler papers at the Library at the Katz Center, we find Adler being made aware of the planning in Spain, particularly in Maimonides’ native city of Córdoba, for the upcoming celebrations in March of the coming year. The author of the letter, Leon H. Elmaleh, long-time cantor and lecturer at the Spanish and Portuguese Congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia, sent Adler under separate cover what he originally wrote to the editor of the _Philadelphia Jewish Exponent_ to inform its readers about the historic recognition by Spain of its ties to the Jewish sage of Córdoba. Elmaleh emphasized the significance of the events and the vitality of the scholarly and professional community in Spain, despite recent, albeit temporarily quelled, political turmoil. Well aware of Dropsie College’s long-standing commitment to Sephardic Studies, Elmaleh most likely forwarded his letter to Adler in the hope he would help disseminate news of the events and perhaps even send a representative to Spain, as Jewish leaders from other nations were planning on attending. Adler indeed immediately sent on the letter to Jewish leaders and sought advice about how to support the Spanish efforts.\n\nElmaleh’s letter to Adler also included an English translation of the August 1934 manifesto published by the Royal Academy of Sciences and Fine Arts of Córdoba, in collaboration with the City of Córdoba, and signed by the city’s highest political and academic officials, declaring their intention to commemorate the eighth centennial of the birth of the Cordoban native. The manifesto emphasizes local and regional pride, as it declared Maimonides as “one of its most illustrious sons.” The national government of the Spanish Republic which faced the twin threats of political disintegration and rising fascism soon followed suit by publishing an official decree (on December 8, 1934) signed by Prime Minister Alejandro Lerroux, declaring official government sponsorship of the public celebration to take place in Córdoba between March 25 and March 31 of 1935. The commemorative rites in Cordoba thus provided a context for redeeming and reclaiming the Spanish Republic through the re-envisioning of a tolerant transnational and diasporic Spanish patria, specifically through the reintegration of the memory of “Sepharad” and living Sephardim into its fold.\n\nDropsie College does not seem to have sent a representative to Spain in 1935 and the Republic fell and civil war broke out shortly after the commemoration. Spain nonetheless, came to the attention of Cyrus Adler once again in 1938: On February 1st he received an urgent telegram from “American Friends of Spanish Democracy” asking him to support their message to President Roosevelt supporting public protest against the bombing of residential districts in Spanish cities by the Nationalist rebel faction. In a demonstration of his resounding support for the Spanish Republic, Adler immediately responded by telegram that he would “gladly” sign the message. Adler’s support, as well as the fact that his signature was considered important for this cause (he was also approached by the Abraham Lincoln Brigades and the Social Worker´s Committee to aid Spanish Democracy for Child Welfare) indicates broad public awareness of Adler’s public advocacy on behalf of socially liberal causes, as well as the participation of Jewish leadership in the international fight against fascism.

The editor and publisher Peretz Smolenskin (1842-1885) dedicated the journal to Hebrew literature and Judaic studies (Chochmat Israel). The significance of the journal's title and subtitle, _Ha-Shahar (The Dawn): will illuminate the path of the children of Israel in the past and in the present_ is explained in the Opening Manifesto (volume 1, III-VI) in which the editor expressed the distinct enlightened-national viewpoint of the journal. The use of the Hebrew language for Jewish science, literature and poetry was a clear ideological manifestation of this outlook and a vehicle for promoting Jewish cultural nationalism. In the twelve volumes of _Ha-Shahar_ we find the publications of entire novels by Smolenskin himself along with novels of other Hebrew writers of the era. Most of the Hebrew poets of the time contributed regularly to Ha-Shahar, among them Yehuda Leib Gordon (YaLaG). A prominent part of the journal was dedicated to scholarly works of Judaic Studies, historiographic articles and book critics. Therefore _Ha-Shahar_ was a pioneering journal, not only for the Hebrew _Haskalah_ literature, but also in the national version of Jewish studies in the Hebrew language.\n\n### Gotthard Deutsch and the updating of Wissenschaft des Judentums in the United States\n\nMichael Meyer\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/meyer900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe need to update historical study is generally recognized as essential to the progress of Wissenschaft des Judentums, the modern critical approach to Judaism. New questions arise, new sources are discovered, and conclusions reached in recent books and articles augment and alter what is contained in standard works. Gotthard Deutsch (1859-1921) was a German-trained Jewish historian who taught at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati beginning in 1891. He had been a student of the greatest Jewish historian of the nineteenth century, Heinrich Graetz (1817-1891), and owned a set of his multi-volume _Geschichte der Juden_. However, Deutsch realized that if he were to become a successor to Graetz, he had to update Graetz's work with the multiple new facts that had become known since Graetz published his history. So whenever Deutsch encountered a significant new source or study, he inscribed its essence into his interleaved copy of the relevant Graetz volume. For example, when Ludwig Geiger published a history of the Berlin Jewish community with passages relevant to the Reform movement, Deutsch added material from Geiger to update Graetz on the blank page opposite his treatment of the first permanent Reform synagogue, the Hamburg Temple.\n\n### Mendez Pinto's Travels and Oriental Scholarship\n\nKatalin Rac\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/rac-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/mendez-pintos-travels-and-oriental-scholarship?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-12/rac-illustration1200.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/mendez-pintos-travels-and-oriental-scholarship?item=1)\n\n_The Voyages and Adventures of Ferdinand Mendez Pinto, the Portuguese_ is one of the best-known travelogues of all time. Pinto (who died in 1583) was the first European who described in writing what he saw and experienced during his travels in South East Asia. His manuscript was printed not only in the original Portuguese; the English edition in Henry Cogan's translation was published in London in 1663 and over the centuries several other translations and editions saw light. The Library at the Katz Center holds the 1897 English edition, which is an abridged version of the original Cogan translation and includes an introduction by the Hungarian Jewish orientalist Armin Vambery. Vambery, a self-taught Turkologist, traveler, and popular author of travelogues, stressed the importance of Pinto's book in advancing European knowledge about Asia in the early modern period. He also emphasized the saliency of travel in modern Oriental scholarship. His introduction illustrates that nineteenth-century orientalists believed that traveling complemented philological, archeological, and historical research. Like Pinto and Vambery, they wrote travelogues to inform readers about their experiences in far-away lands, educate European audiences about distant cultures, and, consequently, to popularize their scholarship. Publishing travelogues ensured a steady income, which allowed them to continue their scholarly research. In addition, for Jewish scholars like Vambery, the publication of travelogues and shorter reports about the Orient was an important means to claim membership in the modern European public sphere and demonstrate that not only fellow academics, but also the broader public found their research interesting.\n\n### Religious Reform in 19th Century Italy: Calls to Abolish Circumcision and _Metsitsah be-peh_\n\nAsher Salah\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/salah-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/religious-reform-19th-century-italy-calls-abolish?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/salah-responsa1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/religious-reform-19th-century-italy-calls-abolish?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/salah-gazzetta900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/religious-reform-19th-century-italy-calls-abolish?item=2)\n\nDepicted here (left, top) is the frontispiece of a small notebook containing a handwritten text conceived for a course held in the month of February and March, 1838, at the Rabbinical Seminary of Padua by the renowned physician Dr. Samuel Medoro (1788-1854). In his lessons concerning the performance of circumcision, Dr. Medoro supports the abolishment of _metsitsah be-peh_ (sucking by mouth the blood from the wound) from a medical as well as from a social standpoint, not only because it can endanger the newborn's health but also because he deems it to be indecorous. Moreover, his booklet reveals a tight cooperation between the students and appointed teachers at the rabbinical seminar of Padua—the first of its kind in Europe and one of the main centers of the science of Judaism in Italy—and some of the most distinguished Jewish representatives of the medical profession, educated in the best Italian universities (such as the physicians Donato Benvenisti, his son Moise, and Amedeo Conegliano, who served like Medoro himself as surgeons in the local confraternity \"Il Sovvegno\" which endowed medical assistance to Jews in the city). The importance of this document is manifold. It sheds new light upon at least three aspects of intellectual history of 19th century Italian Jews: first, the role of scientific thought in the redefinition of halakhic boundaries during the emancipation period; second, the diffusion and impact of reformist trends even within the most traditional and orthodox circles; third, the existence of trans-regional networks connecting Jewish communities throughout the different States in which was divided the Italian peninsula capable of implementing concerted changes in Mosaic law. Written prior to the wide-ranging debate that stirred Europe when the newly established in Frankfurt _Verein der Reformfreunde_ (the Society of the Friends of Reform) in 1842 affirmed the optional status of circumcision, Medoro's work proves that religious reforms were addressed in Italy independently from the successes and backlashes of similar trends in the German-speaking areas.\n\nBut perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the bundle of documents purchased by the Penn Libraries at auction in Israel in 2012 is the copies of the responsa of fourteen rabbis written in Italian between November 18th, 1847, and May 6th, 1852, plus a page with excerpts from an article published in the _Gazzetta Medica Italiana—province venete_, 14 (1864), accompanying Medoro's tractate (left, bottom). These sources, collected and transcribed later in the second half of the 19th century, which recommended the elimination of the metsitsah, reveal an interesting and up to now unknown reformist plan involving the main figures of Italian rabbinate of the time and some of the most important Jewish communities of Central and Northern Italy well before the proclamation of the newly independent and unified Kingdom of Italy in 1861. If on the one hand the religious status of circumcision is defended as compatible with the spirit of the Jewish legislator and required by modern standards of hygiene, on the other some components of its performance, such as the _metsitsah_ and the _tselifat ha-yain_ (wine aspersion over the wound) might be omitted, fusing thereby tradition with modernity, orthodoxy with science in what can be rightfully considered a specifically Italian blend.\n\n### Sources for Study: The Ancient Samaritan Community\n\nStefan Schorch\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schorch1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe Samaritans, an offspring of the tradition of Ancient Israel, became independent from the Jewish tradition in the 2nd century BCE. A main point of difference between Jews and Samaritans has been the question of the central holy place, which according to the Samaritan beliefs is not found in Jerusalem, but on Mount Gerizim in the vicinity of Nablus, or the Biblical city of Shechem.\n\nAlthough their sanctuary on Mount Gerizim was destroyed in 128 BCE, the Samaritans have continued to celebrate the yearly Passover sacrifice in accordance with the Biblical text of Exodus 12. The present manuscript from the collections of the Katz Center \\[CAJS Rar Ms 104, 31v-32r\\], a booklet with 190 pages, contains the festival liturgy for this holiday with prayers in Samaritan Aramaic and Hebrew, and with commentaries and explanations in Arabic. It was written in 1844, at a time when the Samaritan holy places on the summit of the mountain were generally inaccessible for the Samaritans due to restrictions imposed by the Ottoman authorities. The manuscript gives witness to this difficult situation since the prayer on the morning of Passover is reported to be held in the city of Nablus, and not on Mount Gerizim, according to the title of that part. The page shown on this image gives a list of Biblical passages to be recited during this service.\n\nThe manuscript was among those brought from Nablus to London by the Samaritan Jacob ash-Shalaby in 1854, and it became part of the manuscript collection of Mayer Sulzberger in 1912. Sulzberger (1843‒1923), a leading judge and a most important public figure in Philadelphia, and the first president of Dropsie College, was born in Germany and came to the US as a child after the revolution of 1848. His collection of Samaritan manuscripts is one of the biggest and most important world-wide.\n\n### A century of Letterheads of the Dropsie College - Annenberg Institute - Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies\n\nDani Schrire\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schrire7-900%402x.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/century-letterheads-dropsie-college-annenberg?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schrire6-900%402x.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/century-letterheads-dropsie-college-annenberg?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schrire5-900%402x.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/century-letterheads-dropsie-college-annenberg?item=2)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schrire4-900%402x.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/century-letterheads-dropsie-college-annenberg?item=3)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schrire2-900%402x.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/century-letterheads-dropsie-college-annenberg?item=4)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schrire2-900%402x_0.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/century-letterheads-dropsie-college-annenberg?item=5)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schrire1-900%402x.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/century-letterheads-dropsie-college-annenberg?item=6)\n\nAmong singular and unique items found in the archives of the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, some documents testify to mundane practices that are part of institutional everyday life. An example of such items is the various letterheads of the Katz Center in all its incarnations (from the Dropsie College through the Annenberg Institute). While one may think of letterheads as mere \"frames\" of the actual—important singular and unique—content of letters, they in fact deserve much scholarly attention if one wants to examine institutional history, in this case a key institution in the history of Jewish Studies. The letterheads presented here tell an institutional story that kept transforming in the course of a century in ways that reveal some key tensions in the way Jewish Studies developed as a field.\n\nOne can begin by reflecting on the transformations in the title of the letterheads: the letterhead of \"The Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning Philadelphia\" demonstrates that the key factor in determining this institute's scope related to language. It may indicate a specific concern with textual material, making one wonder if Yiddish, Ladino and Judeo-Arabic cultures would have been conceived as 'cognate.' When Dropsie University transformed into the \"Annenberg Research Institute for Judaic and Near Eastern Studies,\", one notices a shift from language to a more general idea of Judaism which appears in conjunction with a clear geographic indicator; while the literature and history of American Jewry seems to fall under the category of 'Judaic,' it seems beyond the key concept of an institute that examined also the 'Near East.' Once the Institute was encompassed as part of the University of Pennsylvania, the general form of \"Judaic Studies\" remained, leaving more room for interpretation. Under the leadership of David Ruderman another transformation of the Center is apparent in the letterhead—the addition of a small but important adjective, 'advanced'—an immediate reminiscence of the Center for Advanced Studies in Princeton and other centers that were modeled after it.\n\nInterestingly, individual names on the letterheads play an important role only in the Annenberg Institute letterhead and do not play a role in the other letterheads. With the integration of the center into the University of Pennsylvania system, this has changed: the growing prominence of the Penn iconography secured the institutional authority of the Center; although the Center was housed in the same building of the Annenberg Institute (both letterheads relate to the same address on Walnut street), the letterheads convey an important shift from being tied to prominent individual figures to a well-established academic institution.\n\nOther changes in fonts and graphic sensibilities add to the idea that letterheads are not just containers of messages; rather they deliver other messages that are very clear to those who compose them and are clear in much more subtle ways to those who use them (or read them) in their scholarly everyday life.\n\n### Solomon Schechter accepts the post of director of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA) in New York City\n\nMirjam Thulin\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/thulin1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn 1902 Solomon Schechter moved from Cambridge/ England to New York City in order to take office as the director of and instructor in Talmud and history at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA). The image displayed shows the first page of Schechter's acceptance letter to Max Cohen, member of the Board of Trustees of the JTSA. After the demise in 1873 of Maimonides College, the first modern rabbinical seminary in the United States, the reform-oriented movement of Judaism established the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati in 1875. In 1886, the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS), the successor to Maimonides College's more traditional orientation, was founded in New York under the supervision of the Reverend Sabato Morais, who had taught Bible at Maimonides College and was the minister of the Spanish and Portuguese Congregaton Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia. In 1902, five years after Morais' death, the JTS merged with a new legal corporation: the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA). During the previous decade, the Seminary's leaders had recruited Schechter to succeed Morais and lead the institution.\n\nIn his acceptance letter, Schechter expresses his thoughtful balance of reasons about his decision whether or not to follow the call to New York. As Schechter writes, he finally came to the solution to accept the position offered because he felt it was his \"duty.\" In the same letter, he already started the negotiations with the JTSA board about his post, e.g., he raised the question if he was actually going to be the director of the seminary or rather in charge to change and advancing the outdated curriculum. In fact, with Schechter's move to America the curriculum of the seminary was transformed towards the concepts of the European _Wissenschaft des Judentums._ Higher requirements to the instructors and students and an emphasis on the academic approach would finally change American Jewish scholarship to a great extent and not least cement the formation of a \"Conservative\" understanding and practice of _Wissenschaft des Judentums_ in the United States.\n\n### B.Z.

Goldberg to the editor of The New Palestine, we have a glimpse into a broader ideological clash—in this case, between two Jewish émigrés from Eastern Europe—regarding the nature of Soviet Communism and its treatment of Jews in the very early stages of the Cold War. Goldberg accuses renowned demographer Jacob Lestschinsky, in his article \"Soviet Jews or Soviet Jewry,\" of drastically inflating Jewish casualties on Soviet territory during World War II and of groundlessly attributing these deaths to the policies of the Soviet government. He also takes Lestschinsky to task for misquoting Goldberg's own journalistic reports made during a tour of the USSR in 1946. Characterizing Lestschinsky as a \"Soviet baiter,\" Goldberg argues that Soviet policies towards its Jewish population are in fact remarkably progressive: antisemitism has been virtually eradicated; Yiddish language and culture enjoys far greater prestige in the USSR than in the United States; Jews have been granted their own autonomous region in Birobidzhan; and they were given priority status for evacuation to Soviet Central Asia during the war.\n\nGoldberg's letter also offers insight into the highly politicized nature of \"counting Jews\" in both life and death. In dismissing Lestschinsky as a \"weeper,\" Goldberg's rhetoric closely parallels that of Soviet Jewish demographers in the early 1930s who mocked Lestschinsky for allegedly inflating the number of anti-Jewish pogrom casualties during the Russian Civil War. In challenging Lestschinsky's arithmetic, Goldberg contests the pessimism underlying prevailing conceptions of Jewish identity: \"Does being Jewish consist only of fighting discrimination?\" he queries. His answer: \"There is an active and vigorous Jewish life in the USSR, but it is a confident, positive Jewish life, not a fearful and defensive one.\" Events transpiring between 1948 and 1953—the Anticosmopolitan Campaign, the arrest and execution of Soviet Yiddish cultural figures, and the Doctor's Plot—would ultimately force Goldberg to acknowledge that late Stalinism had destroyed this brave new model of Soviet Jewishness. His 1961 book _The Jewish Problem in the Soviet Union: Analysis and Solution_ offers a long-term reflection on why the vision outlined in his letter to the editor proved illusory.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Aleksiun, Natalia.** _DokaL(d dalej?: ruch syjonistyczny w Polsce (1944-1950) Other title: Ruch syjonistyczny w Polsce (1944-1950)._ (Warszawa: Centrum Badania i Nauczania DziejoLw ZLydoLw w Polsce im.

In time, modern rabbinical seminaries in central Europe and universities in France, England, the US and Israel would provide new and necessary forms of institutionalization. The needs and strategies of the discipline and its political and cultural functions varied in different countries and political contexts. The turn to history in the 19th century fundamentally recast the nature of Jewish thinking in Europe and beyond, influencing even those who challenged or rejected the dominance and mandate of historical-critical scholarship. The predominant narrative in this history of the academic study of Jews and Judaism is that of the \u003Cem>Wissenschaft des Judentums\u003C/em> (WdJ), which fulfilled crucial cultural, political, and religious functions in its day, and which, despite recent scholarship, remains to be fully contextualized. This past year’s Fellows explored critical questions about how academic categories and methodologies have framed how Jews and Judaism are understood—be they in parallel with Christian theology, political science, history, classical philology, or in relation to traditional learning contexts. In this exhibition, we find examples of the fruits of their intellectual labors in reconstructing the history of the academic study of Judaism from these early, diverse seedbeds.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-making-of-the-world-congress-of-jewish-studies-kenesiyah-gedolah-le-hokhmat-yisrael\">The Making of the World Congress of Jewish Studies (Kenesiyah gedolah le-hokhmat yisra’el)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Natalia Aleksiun\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/making-world-congress-jewish-studies-kenesiyah?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aleksiun-proposal1-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px;

A member of the Council - Mojżesz Schorr (1874-1941)—a distinguished historian and a Warsaw rabbi—took the initial steps in designing the future “World Congress of Jewish Studies.” In the summer of 1928, he circulated his ideas among leading Jewish intellectuals worldwide. Schorr argued that such a congress had become necessary given the rapid growth of the field and the “spiritual renaissance of the Jewish people.” Indeed, like other full-fledged scholarly disciplines, Jewish studies merited an organized forum.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Cyrus Adler (1863-1940)—one of the addressees of the proposal—voiced numerous reservations or, as he put it in his letter to Schorr in January 1929, “I do not find myself very much in sympathy with this idea.” Pointing to the limited financial resources available to Jewish scholars worldwide and in particular the lack of “Government patronage,” Adler opted for focusing resources on already existing scholarly initiatives. Moreover, he suggested a more grass-roots approach, with “local academies” serving as the organizing principle for Jewish studies. While Adler’s response focuses on the structural weaknesses of Jewish studies and its practitioners, the debate with Schorr allows us to see the maturing of international academic networks and the influence of institutional models borrowed from other, more established fields.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"cardoso-philosophia-libera\">Cardoso, \u003Cem>Philosophia Libera\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Andrew Berns\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/berns900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The physician and philosopher Isaac Cardoso (d. 1683), who began life as a converso in Spain and died a professing Jew in Italy, published a lavish folio volume in 1673 entitled \u003Cem>Philosophia Libera\u003C/em>. Cardoso had received his medical education in Salamanca, and published his book in one of Europe’s most important printing centers: Venice. The book is a schematic survey and critique of the history of philosophy, and contains much information on the Jewish origins of philosophy and science. Two scriptural quotations are prominently featured on the frontispiece. One is directly related to the book’s theme, and is taken from the thirty-sixth chapter of Job. Elihu proclaims the majesty of God”s creation: “All people have looked on it; everyone watches it from far away.” Cardoso’s aim was to “look on it” from a much closer perspective. Indeed \u003Cem>Philosophia Libera\u003C/em> does so and offers a fine justification for studying nature: “we shall investigate Nature and its Founder, so that from the world and its multitude of things, as if by a ladder, with enlightened and instructed mind, we may be lifted to God its Maker; for His creatures are the ladder by which we ascend to God, the organ with which we praise God, and the school in which we learn God.” There is perhaps no better summary of Cardoso’s mission, as well as that of scientifically-inclined Jews in Italy and Spain from the Middle Ages through the Enlightenment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"honoring-a-founder-from-the-life-of-leopold-zunz-edited-by-siegmund-maybaum\">Honoring a Founder: From the Life of Leopold Zunz, edited by Siegmund Maybaum\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Amos Bitzan\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/bitzan900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>In 1894, on the centenary of the birth of Leopold Zunz (1794-1886), the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums in Berlin, published its 12th annual report together with a supplement devoted to the great scholar whom the institution saw as its founder. Zunz had called for the revival of scholarship devoted to Jewish literature in a famous 1818 essay, “On Rabbinic Literature.” The wealth of scholarly publications that appeared in the following decades testify to the reception of his call. Although most of Zunz’s scholarly oeuvre was decidedly not popular and sometimes difficult to digest, Zunz’s persona and life were represented in popular terms after his death. This 1894 publication by Maybaum (1844-1919), himself a great scholar of Jewish antiquity and late antiquity, gathered some of Zunz’s personal correspondence from the years between 1818 and 1839, when Zunz struggled to secure a permanent position for himself as a rabbi or communal teacher. The correspondence consists mainly of his applications for candidacy and requests for assistance as well as a few rejections and negative appraisals sent by or about him. In Maybaum’s words, “these failed attempts … led him to the realization that his nature was suited only for work in complete independence” (p. 2). That is to say, they mark Zunz’s turn to Wissenschaft (scholarship) alone and for its own sake.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The attached image is from Maybaum p. 11 and consists of Maybaum’s reproduction of a chart that Zunz prepared in which he documented all the sermons he had given at the “German Synagogue in Berlin.” The table lists the date of the sermon and the verse(s) that it discussed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"elia-benamozegh-and-the-printing-of-levantine-jewish-scholarship\">Elia Benamozegh and the printing of Levantine Jewish scholarship\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Clémence Boulouque\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/boulouque900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>An Italian rabbi, kabbalist, and thinker of Moroccan descent who lived in the Tuscan port city of Livorno, Elia Benamozegh (1823-1900) authored an abundance of works, encompassing exegesis, historical studies and various newspaper contributions, written in Hebrew, Italian and French. Through his posthumous masterwork, \u003Cem>Israel and Humanity\u003C/em> (1914), he significantly influenced the Christian-Jewish dialogue in Europe and rekindled the Noachide movement. In the books penned in French or Italian, brimming with references to Western philosophy and literature, he never made mention of his Oriental roots and rarely cited Sephardic contemporary authors. Yet his publishing activities situated him in the Middle East and North-African world. If various prayer books, spanning all Sephardic rituals, arguably signal a more commercial side of his activity, Benamozegh also showed perceptiveness with regards to his selection of Sephardic thinkers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The catalogue of the volumes he published demonstrate his commitment to foster a sense of identity which embraces tradition in a modern key, as well as a sense of unity of Oriental Jews. And, because his endeavors displeased some more conservative actors, Benamozegh seems to have used his press as a way to publish his like-minded contemporaries, thus mapping out a landscape of modern Sephardic thought. This is certainly the case for the haggadah revised by Shelomoh Bekhor Hutsin (1843-1892) which Benamozegh published in 1887. This book, printed in Judeo-Arabic, Arabic, and Hebrew, according to the Baghdadi minhag (liturgical custom), lies at the juncture of tradition and modernity. Hutsin was a student of rabbi Abdallah Somekh (1813-1902) and a graduate of the very selective Yeshiva set up by Somekh, called Beth Zilkha, from which all the graduates became community leaders. Hutsin wrote liturgical works, numerous articles and was an advocate of a version of Jewish enlightenment that was respectful of Jewish values and modern culture. In 1863, Barukh Moshe Misrahi established the first press of Baghdad. In 1882 the activities ceased, only to be resumed by Hutsin in 1888– this is exactly in the interim that Benamozegh published this Haggadah. This cooperation seems to show that Benamozegh was in the know about both the business side but also the life of ideas in Baghdad; it is evidence of the sustained intense intellectual contacts in the Mediterranean and the Levant—and of a different kind of Enlightenment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"abraham-geiger-and-quranic-scholarship\">Abraham Geiger and Quranic scholarship\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Daniel Boušek\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/bousek900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>In 1833, Abraham Geiger published \u003Cem>Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judenthume aufgenommen?\u003C/em> (“What did Muhammad borrow from Judaism?”). The essay, originally written in Latin and submitted to the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Bonn the previous year, was awarded a prize by the Faculty in August of 1832. Geiger’s work has rightly been judged a methodological breakthrough and a turning point in European scholarship about the origins and sources of Islam. Geiger was the first scholar to “historize” the Qurʾān, i.e. to read the text critically in light of the historical contexts in which it was written. For example, Geiger scrutinizes the vocabulary of the Qur’ān in order to identify words and ideas which were, as he assumed, borrowed from Judaism and earlier Jewish traditions. Although some of Geiger’s assumptions may today appear naïve and judgmental, his major contribution was to approach the relationship between the two religions conceptually rather than polemically, and systematically rather than haphazardly. The book aroused something of a stir among Geiger’s Christian colleagues by portraying the Prophet Muhammad as “a sincere religious enthusiast (schwärmer) who was himself convinced of his divine mission” and not as a skilled imposter and charlatan, as viewed by Silvestre de Sacy, the leading Arabist of the time. But the main importance of Geiger’s \u003Cem>Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judenthume aufgenommen?\u003C/em> lies in the fact that it has for the first time posed questions that stand in the center of Qur’ānic research till today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"zacharias-frankel-darkhe-ha-mishnah-ve-darkhe-ha-sefarim-ha-nilvim-eleha-tosefta-mekhilta-sifra-sifre-helek-rishon-petihah-leha-mishnah-leipzig-1859\">Zacharias Frankel, Darkhe ha-mishnah ve-darkhe ha-sefarim ha-nilvim eleha Tosefta, Mekhilta, Sifra, Sifre.

On the other hand, there were radical and moderate versions of a Reform Judaism that looked at tradition through the prism of historical criticism, and evaluated conceptions of faith and its practice using yardsticks calibrated in terms of the cultural and social parameters of the non-Jewish environment. Between Reform Judaism and Orthodoxy, representatives of a third religious current began to distance themselves from Reform and Orthodoxy and express their views in the public arena. Prominent among them was Zacharias Frankel, born in Prague in 1801. After obtaining his doctorate in Budapest in 1830, Frankel was appointed rabbi (\u003Cem>Kreisrabbiner\u003C/em>) in Leitmeritz (Litoměřice) in Bohemia, before the Dresden Jewish Community elected him as chief rabbi in 1836. In Saxony he served until 1854, establishing a reputation as a “moderate reformer.” He then moved to Breslau after having been appointed director of the newly founded Jewish Theological Seminary, the first modern rabbinical training institute on German soil.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As one of the pioneers of modern \u003Cem>Wissenschaft des Judentums\u003C/em>, Frankel gained fame mainly as a historian of Jewish religious law. In his scholarship he freely adapted concepts originally developed by Friedrich Carl von Savigny and other scholars of the German Historical School of Jurisprudence. In 1859 Heinrich Hunger, a German non Jewish publishing house, seated in Leipzig, printed Frankel’s magnus opum, a scientific introduction to the Mishna. The author initially conceptualized the book as the first part in a series of works dedicated to the history of Tannaitic halakhic literature. However, no further volumes were ever to be published.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Frankel’s book \u003Cem>Darkhe ha-mishnah\u003C/em> is considered a milestone in modern Jewish scholarship. There also is good reason to call the research he presented “counter-history” because Frankel used key texts of Orthodox Judaism against Orthodoxy in order to corroborate his view of a tradition that had not been revealed at Sinai but developed over the course of history and by that process had gained sacred status. Frankel was severely attacked by conservative religious circles who perceived his introduction as a threat—partly because of its use as a textbook at the seminary, but also due to the circumstance that it was written in Hebrew in order to aim at a traditionalist audience in Eastern Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-in-córdoba\">Celebrating Maimonides’ 800th Birthday in Córdoba\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Michal Rose Friedman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-cordoba?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/friedman-celebration1-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-cordoba?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/friedman-celebration2-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-cordoba?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/friedman-celebration3-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-cordoba?item=3\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/friedman-fromadler-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-cordoba?item=4\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/friedman-telegram-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/celebrating-maimonides-800th-birthday-cordoba?item=5\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/friedman-telegramresponse-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 1935, elaborate commemorative events took place throughout the world marking the octocentennial of the birth of Maimonides (Rabbi Moses bar Maimon 1135-1204), the medieval Jewish communal leader, philosopher, and physician. With Cyrus Adler at its helm, Dropsie College in Philadelphia took a leading role in the organization of the official commemorative events in the United States. In a letter, dated December 7th, 1934, found in the Adler papers at the Library at the Katz Center, we find Adler being made aware of the planning in Spain, particularly in Maimonides’ native city of Córdoba, for the upcoming celebrations in March of the coming year. The author of the letter, Leon H. Elmaleh, long-time cantor and lecturer at the Spanish and Portuguese Congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia, sent Adler under separate cover what he originally wrote to the editor of the \u003Cem>Philadelphia Jewish Exponent\u003C/em> to inform its readers about the historic recognition by Spain of its ties to the Jewish sage of Córdoba. Elmaleh emphasized the significance of the events and the vitality of the scholarly and professional community in Spain, despite recent, albeit temporarily quelled, political turmoil. Well aware of Dropsie College’s long-standing commitment to Sephardic Studies, Elmaleh most likely forwarded his letter to Adler in the hope he would help disseminate news of the events and perhaps even send a representative to Spain, as Jewish leaders from other nations were planning on attending. Adler indeed immediately sent on the letter to Jewish leaders and sought advice about how to support the Spanish efforts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Elmaleh’s letter to Adler also included an English translation of the August 1934 manifesto published by the Royal Academy of Sciences and Fine Arts of Córdoba, in collaboration with the City of Córdoba, and signed by the city’s highest political and academic officials, declaring their intention to commemorate the eighth centennial of the birth of the Cordoban native. The manifesto emphasizes local and regional pride, as it declared Maimonides as “one of its most illustrious sons.” The national government of the Spanish Republic which faced the twin threats of political disintegration and rising fascism soon followed suit by publishing an official decree (on December 8, 1934) signed by Prime Minister Alejandro Lerroux, declaring official government sponsorship of the public celebration to take place in Córdoba between March 25 and March 31 of 1935. The commemorative rites in Cordoba thus provided a context for redeeming and reclaiming the Spanish Republic through the re-envisioning of a tolerant transnational and diasporic Spanish patria, specifically through the reintegration of the memory of “Sepharad” and living Sephardim into its fold.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dropsie College does not seem to have sent a representative to Spain in 1935 and the Republic fell and civil war broke out shortly after the commemoration. Spain nonetheless, came to the attention of Cyrus Adler once again in 1938: On February 1st he received an urgent telegram from “American Friends of Spanish Democracy” asking him to support their message to President Roosevelt supporting public protest against the bombing of residential districts in Spanish cities by the Nationalist rebel faction. In a demonstration of his resounding support for the Spanish Republic, Adler immediately responded by telegram that he would “gladly” sign the message. Adler’s support, as well as the fact that his signature was considered important for this cause (he was also approached by the Abraham Lincoln Brigades and the Social Worker´s Committee to aid Spanish Democracy for Child Welfare) indicates broad public awareness of Adler’s public advocacy on behalf of socially liberal causes, as well as the participation of Jewish leadership in the international fight against fascism.

The editor and publisher Peretz Smolenskin (1842-1885) dedicated the journal to Hebrew literature and Judaic studies (Chochmat Israel). The significance of the journal’s title and subtitle, \u003Cem>Ha-Shahar (The Dawn): will illuminate the path of the children of Israel in the past and in the present\u003C/em> is explained in the Opening Manifesto (volume 1, III-VI) in which the editor expressed the distinct enlightened-national viewpoint of the journal. The use of the Hebrew language for Jewish science, literature and poetry was a clear ideological manifestation of this outlook and a vehicle for promoting Jewish cultural nationalism. In the twelve volumes of \u003Cem>Ha-Shahar\u003C/em> we find the publications of entire novels by Smolenskin himself along with novels of other Hebrew writers of the era.

New questions arise, new sources are discovered, and conclusions reached in recent books and articles augment and alter what is contained in standard works. Gotthard Deutsch (1859-1921) was a German-trained Jewish historian who taught at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati beginning in 1891. He had been a student of the greatest Jewish historian of the nineteenth century, Heinrich Graetz (1817-1891), and owned a set of his multi-volume \u003Cem>Geschichte der Juden\u003C/em>. However, Deutsch realized that if he were to become a successor to Graetz, he had to update Graetz’s work with the multiple new facts that had become known since Graetz published his history. So whenever Deutsch encountered a significant new source or study, he inscribed its essence into his interleaved copy of the relevant Graetz volume. For example, when Ludwig Geiger published a history of the Berlin Jewish community with passages relevant to the Reform movement, Deutsch added material from Geiger to update Graetz on the blank page opposite his treatment of the first permanent Reform synagogue, the Hamburg Temple.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"mendez-pintos-travels-and-oriental-scholarship\">Mendez Pinto’s Travels and Oriental Scholarship\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Katalin Rac\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/mendez-pintos-travels-and-oriental-scholarship?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/rac-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/mendez-pintos-travels-and-oriental-scholarship?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-12/rac-illustration1200.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>The Voyages and Adventures of Ferdinand Mendez Pinto, the Portuguese\u003C/em> is one of the best-known travelogues of all time. Pinto (who died in 1583) was the first European who described in writing what he saw and experienced during his travels in South East Asia. His manuscript was printed not only in the original Portuguese; the English edition in Henry Cogan’s translation was published in London in 1663 and over the centuries several other translations and editions saw light. The Library at the Katz Center holds the 1897 English edition, which is an abridged version of the original Cogan translation and includes an introduction by the Hungarian Jewish orientalist Armin Vambery. Vambery, a self-taught Turkologist, traveler, and popular author of travelogues, stressed the importance of Pinto’s book in advancing European knowledge about Asia in the early modern period. He also emphasized the saliency of travel in modern Oriental scholarship. His introduction illustrates that nineteenth-century orientalists believed that traveling complemented philological, archeological, and historical research. Like Pinto and Vambery, they wrote travelogues to inform readers about their experiences in far-away lands, educate European audiences about distant cultures, and, consequently, to popularize their scholarship. Publishing travelogues ensured a steady income, which allowed them to continue their scholarly research. In addition, for Jewish scholars like Vambery, the publication of travelogues and shorter reports about the Orient was an important means to claim membership in the modern European public sphere and demonstrate that not only fellow academics, but also the broader public found their research interesting.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"religious-reform-in-19th-century-italy-calls-to-abolish-circumcision-and-metsitsah-be-peh\">Religious Reform in 19th Century Italy: Calls to Abolish Circumcision and \u003Cem>Metsitsah be-peh\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Asher Salah\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/religious-reform-19th-century-italy-calls-abolish?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/salah-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/religious-reform-19th-century-italy-calls-abolish?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/salah-responsa1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/doing-wissenschaft/religious-reform-19th-century-italy-calls-abolish?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/salah-gazzetta900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Depicted here (left, top) is the frontispiece of a small notebook containing a handwritten text conceived for a course held in the month of February and March, 1838, at the Rabbinical Seminary of Padua by the renowned physician Dr. Samuel Medoro (1788-1854). In his lessons concerning the performance of circumcision, Dr. Medoro supports the abolishment of \u003Cem>metsitsah be-peh\u003C/em> (sucking by mouth the blood from the wound) from a medical as well as from a social standpoint, not only because it can endanger the newborn’s health but also because he deems it to be indecorous. Moreover, his booklet reveals a tight cooperation between the students and appointed teachers at the rabbinical seminar of Padua—the first of its kind in Europe and one of the main centers of the science of Judaism in Italy—and some of the most distinguished Jewish representatives of the medical profession, educated in the best Italian universities (such as the physicians Donato Benvenisti, his son Moise, and Amedeo Conegliano, who served like Medoro himself as surgeons in the local confraternity “Il Sovvegno” which endowed medical assistance to Jews in the city). The importance of this document is manifold. It sheds new light upon at least three aspects of intellectual history of 19th century Italian Jews: first, the role of scientific thought in the redefinition of halakhic boundaries during the emancipation period; second, the diffusion and impact of reformist trends even within the most traditional and orthodox circles; third, the existence of trans-regional networks connecting Jewish communities throughout the different States in which was divided the Italian peninsula capable of implementing concerted changes in Mosaic law. Written prior to the wide-ranging debate that stirred Europe when the newly established in Frankfurt \u003Cem>Verein der Reformfreunde\u003C/em> (the Society of the Friends of Reform) in 1842 affirmed the optional status of circumcision, Medoro’s work proves that religious reforms were addressed in Italy independently from the successes and backlashes of similar trends in the German-speaking areas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the bundle of documents purchased by the Penn Libraries at auction in Israel in 2012 is the copies of the responsa of fourteen rabbis written in Italian between November 18th, 1847, and May 6th, 1852, plus a page with excerpts from an article published in the \u003Cem>Gazzetta Medica Italiana—province venete\u003C/em>, 14 (1864), accompanying Medoro’s tractate (left, bottom). These sources, collected and transcribed later in the second half of the 19th century, which recommended the elimination of the metsitsah, reveal an interesting and up to now unknown reformist plan involving the main figures of Italian rabbinate of the time and some of the most important Jewish communities of Central and Northern Italy well before the proclamation of the newly independent and unified Kingdom of Italy in 1861. If on the one hand the religious status of circumcision is defended as compatible with the spirit of the Jewish legislator and required by modern standards of hygiene, on the other some components of its performance, such as the \u003Cem>metsitsah\u003C/em> and the \u003Cem>tselifat ha-yain\u003C/em> (wine aspersion over the wound) might be omitted, fusing thereby tradition with modernity, orthodoxy with science in what can be rightfully considered a specifically Italian blend.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"sources-for-study-the-ancient-samaritan-community\">Sources for Study: The Ancient Samaritan Community\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Stefan Schorch\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schorch1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The Samaritans, an offspring of the tradition of Ancient Israel, became independent from the Jewish tradition in the 2nd century BCE. A main point of difference between Jews and Samaritans has been the question of the central holy place, which according to the Samaritan beliefs is not found in Jerusalem, but on Mount Gerizim in the vicinity of Nablus, or the Biblical city of Shechem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although their sanctuary on Mount Gerizim was destroyed in 128 BCE, the Samaritans have continued to celebrate the yearly Passover sacrifice in accordance with the Biblical text of Exodus 12. The present manuscript from the collections of the Katz Center [CAJS Rar Ms 104, 31v-32r], a booklet with 190 pages, contains the festival liturgy for this holiday with prayers in Samaritan Aramaic and Hebrew, and with commentaries and explanations in Arabic. It was written in 1844, at a time when the Samaritan holy places on the summit of the mountain were generally inaccessible for the Samaritans due to restrictions imposed by the Ottoman authorities. The manuscript gives witness to this difficult situation since the prayer on the morning of Passover is reported to be held in the city of Nablus, and not on Mount Gerizim, according to the title of that part. The page shown on this image gives a list of Biblical passages to be recited during this service.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The manuscript was among those brought from Nablus to London by the Samaritan Jacob ash-Shalaby in 1854, and it became part of the manuscript collection of Mayer Sulzberger in 1912. Sulzberger (1843‒1923), a leading judge and a most important public figure in Philadelphia, and the first president of Dropsie College, was born in Germany and came to the US as a child after the revolution of 1848.

An example of such items is the various letterheads of the Katz Center in all its incarnations (from the Dropsie College through the Annenberg Institute). While one may think of letterheads as mere “frames” of the actual—important singular and unique—content of letters, they in fact deserve much scholarly attention if one wants to examine institutional history, in this case a key institution in the history of Jewish Studies. The letterheads presented here tell an institutional story that kept transforming in the course of a century in ways that reveal some key tensions in the way Jewish Studies developed as a field.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One can begin by reflecting on the transformations in the title of the letterheads: the letterhead of “The Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning Philadelphia” demonstrates that the key factor in determining this institute’s scope related to language. It may indicate a specific concern with textual material, making one wonder if Yiddish, Ladino and Judeo-Arabic cultures would have been conceived as ‘cognate.’ When Dropsie University transformed into the “Annenberg Research Institute for Judaic and Near Eastern Studies,”, one notices a shift from language to a more general idea of Judaism which appears in conjunction with a clear geographic indicator; while the literature and history of American Jewry seems to fall under the category of ‘Judaic,’ it seems beyond the key concept of an institute that examined also the ‘Near East.’ Once the Institute was encompassed as part of the University of Pennsylvania, the general form of “Judaic Studies” remained, leaving more room for interpretation. Under the leadership of David Ruderman another transformation of the Center is apparent in the letterhead—the addition of a small but important adjective, ‘advanced’—an immediate reminiscence of the Center for Advanced Studies in Princeton and other centers that were modeled after it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interestingly, individual names on the letterheads play an important role only in the Annenberg Institute letterhead and do not play a role in the other letterheads. With the integration of the center into the University of Pennsylvania system, this has changed: the growing prominence of the Penn iconography secured the institutional authority of the Center; although the Center was housed in the same building of the Annenberg Institute (both letterheads relate to the same address on Walnut street), the letterheads convey an important shift from being tied to prominent individual figures to a well-established academic institution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Other changes in fonts and graphic sensibilities add to the idea that letterheads are not just containers of messages; rather they deliver other messages that are very clear to those who compose them and are clear in much more subtle ways to those who use them (or read them) in their scholarly everyday life.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"solomon-schechter-accepts-the-post-of-director-of-the-jewish-theological-seminary-of-america-jtsa-in-new-york-city\">Solomon Schechter accepts the post of director of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA) in New York City\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Mirjam Thulin\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104728im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/thulin1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>In 1902 Solomon Schechter moved from Cambridge/ England to New York City in order to take office as the director of and instructor in Talmud and history at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA). The image displayed shows the first page of Schechter’s acceptance letter to Max Cohen, member of the Board of Trustees of the JTSA. After the demise in 1873 of Maimonides College, the first modern rabbinical seminary in the United States, the reform-oriented movement of Judaism established the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati in 1875. In 1886, the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS), the successor to Maimonides College’s more traditional orientation, was founded in New York under the supervision of the Reverend Sabato Morais, who had taught Bible at Maimonides College and was the minister of the Spanish and Portuguese Congregaton Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia. In 1902, five years after Morais’ death, the JTS merged with a new legal corporation: the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA). During the previous decade, the Seminary’s leaders had recruited Schechter to succeed Morais and lead the institution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In his acceptance letter, Schechter expresses his thoughtful balance of reasons about his decision whether or not to follow the call to New York. As Schechter writes, he finally came to the solution to accept the position offered because he felt it was his “duty.” In the same letter, he already started the negotiations with the JTSA board about his post, e.g., he raised the question if he was actually going to be the director of the seminary or rather in charge to change and advancing the outdated curriculum. In fact, with Schechter’s move to America the curriculum of the seminary was transformed towards the concepts of the European \u003Cem>Wissenschaft des Judentums.\u003C/em> Higher requirements to the instructors and students and an emphasis on the academic approach would finally change American Jewish scholarship to a great extent and not least cement the formation of a “Conservative” understanding and practice of \u003Cem>Wissenschaft des Judentums\u003C/em> in the United States.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"bz-goldbergs-letter-to-the-new-palestine\">B.Z.

Goldberg to the editor of The New Palestine, we have a glimpse into a broader ideological clash—in this case, between two Jewish émigrés from Eastern Europe—regarding the nature of Soviet Communism and its treatment of Jews in the very early stages of the Cold War. Goldberg accuses renowned demographer Jacob Lestschinsky, in his article “Soviet Jews or Soviet Jewry,” of drastically inflating Jewish casualties on Soviet territory during World War II and of groundlessly attributing these deaths to the policies of the Soviet government. He also takes Lestschinsky to task for misquoting Goldberg’s own journalistic reports made during a tour of the USSR in 1946. Characterizing Lestschinsky as a “Soviet baiter,” Goldberg argues that Soviet policies towards its Jewish population are in fact remarkably progressive: antisemitism has been virtually eradicated; Yiddish language and culture enjoys far greater prestige in the USSR than in the United States; Jews have been granted their own autonomous region in Birobidzhan; and they were given priority status for evacuation to Soviet Central Asia during the war.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Goldberg’s letter also offers insight into the highly politicized nature of “counting Jews” in both life and death. In dismissing Lestschinsky as a “weeper,” Goldberg’s rhetoric closely parallels that of Soviet Jewish demographers in the early 1930s who mocked Lestschinsky for allegedly inflating the number of anti-Jewish pogrom casualties during the Russian Civil War. In challenging Lestschinsky’s arithmetic, Goldberg contests the pessimism underlying prevailing conceptions of Jewish identity: “Does being Jewish consist only of fighting discrimination?” he queries. His answer: “There is an active and vigorous Jewish life in the USSR, but it is a confident, positive Jewish life, not a fearful and defensive one.” Events transpiring between 1948 and 1953—the Anticosmopolitan Campaign, the arrest and execution of Soviet Yiddish cultural figures, and the Doctor’s Plot—would ultimately force Goldberg to acknowledge that late Stalinism had destroyed this brave new model of Soviet Jewishness. His 1961 book \u003Cem>The Jewish Problem in the Soviet Union: Analysis and Solution\u003C/em> offers a long-term reflection on why the vision outlined in his letter to the editor proved illusory.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Aleksiun, Natalia.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>DokaL(d dalej?: ruch syjonistyczny w Polsce (1944-1950) Other title: Ruch syjonistyczny w Polsce (1944-1950).\u003C/em> (Warszawa: Centrum Badania i Nauczania DziejoLw ZLydoLw w Polsce im.

This past year's research group came together to bridge often disconnected areas of scholarship and to probe the meaning of an early modern era of Jewish history on its own terms. Borders and boundaries were understood geographically, but also as social, cultural, legal, political, and economic realities. Recognizing these connected histories helped us understand the internal divisions and new cultural movements and practices within Jewish society; careful study also revealed unexpected new relationships among Jews and non-Jews. In this year's web exhibition, we highlight the boundary as both a dividing line and a place of meeting and mixing between different groups (Jewish and non-Jewish) in an attempt to shed light on the nature of early modern Jewry and the early modern period in general.\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### A Choreography of Sacred Readings: the Complutensian Polyglot Bible\n\nJesús de Prado Plumed\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dePradoPlumed900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe first editorial monument of early modern polyglot philology is the so-called Complutensian Polyglot Bible (ca. 1502-1517, only released after 1520) in six volumes, of which the library at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies possesses a complete copy. This complex biblical edition was the brainchild of Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros (1436-1517), the leading churchman in Spain at the turn of the sixteenth century.\n\nModern scholars have traditionally described the editorial choices in the Complutensian Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts as a compromise by the Complutensian philologists with Jerome's (Latin) Vulgate, also printed in this bible. Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts would have been modified to make them match Jerome's translation. The texts as found in the Complutensian challenge this assumption. For instance, Jeremiah 7:18, \". . . to make cakes to the queen of heaven\" reads the same both in Jerome and in the Hebrew Bible. But the Complutensians innovate with a completely different reading, supposing a form \"mele'khet,\" with an aleph (\"assignment; task\") instead of \"melekhet\" (\"queen\"), thus understanding: \"to make cakes for a heavenly assignment\"—following David Qimhi's medieval exegesis. A telling example of an editorial work that was conceived to correct whenever deemed necessary by the editors' own standards the biblical readings of the fathers of the Church and the Jewish biblical tradition altogether.\n\n### A Hebrew Grammar for Christian Scholars: Abraham De Balmes' Mikneh Avram\n\nFabrizio Lelli\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Lelli-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Lelli-intro900%402x3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Lelli-firstpage1200%402x4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n\"There are divine mysteries . . . in the words and the letters of the Holy text, mysteries that cannot be grasped on the basis of the Latin or Greek \\[versions of the Bible\\].\" By these introductory words, Daniel Bomberg, the publisher of Abraham De Balmes' Hebrew grammar _Mikneh Avram_ (_The Possession of Abram_, Venice, 1523) explains why he decided to commit himself to print a new Hebrew grammar targeted to non-Jews. De Balmes, a talented physician, philosopher, and kabbalist (born in Southern Italy c. 1460, died in Venice c. 1523), is mainly known for his translations from Hebrew into Latin of the Averroistic corpus, sponsored by cardinal Domenico Grimani.\n\nDe Balmes' _Mikneh Avram_ was the first Hebrew grammar addressed by a Jewish scholar to the non-Jewish audience of humanists who were eager to learn Hebrew and the Jewish Kabbalah. The Hebrew text is accompanied by a Latin translation carried out by De Balmes and completed, after the author's death, by Kalonymos ben David Kalonymos. The interest of this edition, which had a wide circulation, resides in the special emphasis attributed to the syntax of Hebrew as well as in the combined use of Aristotelian logic and Kabbalistic allusions, a speculative pattern that characterized De Balmes' intellectual research.\n\n### Censorship in a time of Religious Turmoil\n\nPiet Van Boxel\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/VanBoxelBomberg-1524-censor900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/VanBoxelBomberg-1524-expurgation900%402x3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe invention of the printing press in the middle of the 15th century revolutionized communication and book production in Europe, leading to a thus far unimaginable spread of knowledge. From its early days, Hebrew printing was part and parcel of this innovative device. A succinct introduction to its the history can be viewed on-line at the Penn Libraries' Judaica exhibition \"From Written to Printed Text: The Transmission of Jewish Tradition\" of the David Katz Center for Judaic Studies.\n\nThe spread of knowledge, however, did not only unite people in their intellectual endeavors; it equally divided them in that it brought to light differences of opinion and ideological opposites. In a time of religious turmoil, the Roman Church considered that the most effective means of beating Luther's Reformation was to control and restrict the spread of knowledge, a tactic that resulted in the ineffective tool of censorship. In order to make up for loss of believers the Church authorities also targeted the unbelievers through missionary activities, which did not leave the Jews in the Pontifical State untouched. Like the works of the reformers and their catholic sympathizers, the literary output of Jewish tradition was submitted to an ongoing process of expurgation. In an effort to deprive the Jews of the hope of redemption and the coming of their Messiah, and to accelerate their conversion, ecclesiastical censors were supposed to erase all such passages. Every contradiction of Christian doctrine or alleged offence against the Christian faith, the Church and its flock was to be removed.\n\nWhen looking at early Hebrew printing that had undergone pre-publication censorship or expurgation, one easily—given the predictable outcome of this authoritarian device—sees the inefficiency of this exercise of the Church: in censorship the obvious was left out or in case of expurgation the text, known by heart, was reinserted by hand. Jews have mostly repaired the scars left by the Church, thus making censorship an unsuccessful undertaking.\n\n### Chronicling the Craft of Printing: David Gans' Tsemah David\n\nPavel Sládek\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Sladek900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nGans (1541-1613) resided in Bohemia and was one of the first Central-Eastern European private Jewish scholars. Although not being a rabbi, he studied with some of the most important rabbinic scholars of the day, e.g. with Moshe Isserles or with Sinai ben Betsalel, brother of the Maharal of Prague. He wrote on mathematics, astronomy and especially history. His chronicle _Tsemah David_ (Prague, 1592) manifests his bibliographic interest and fascination with printed book (he used and even referred not only to Jewish but also non-Jewish sources). In the second part of his chronicle (pt. 2, fol. 95b), dealing with the \"history of the world,\", i.e. including the non-Jewish, Gans included a long eulogy for the invention of print \"in the city of Mainz by the means of a Christian gentleman named Johannes Gutenberg.\" Gans enthusiastically acknowledged the potentially universal benefit of printed book not only for scholars, but also for \"craftsmen, laborers, goldsmiths, builders, stonemasons and others, \\[who\\] will reveal and disseminate by the means of print countless useful things and inventions, as many books without end will be printed for workers in all professions!\" It is significant that the paragraph on print is typographically accentuated by the symbol of a crown that is otherwise used in the book only to mark passages speaking of important kings and emperors.\n\n### A Philosophy of Torah by the Maharal of Prague\n\nJoanna Weinberg\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Weinberg-Title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Weinberg-62C002-900%402x3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nJudah Liwa ben Bezalel, better known by his acronym Maharal of Prague, was an original thinker and prolific writer. The _Tiferet Yisrael (Venice: Daniel Zanetti, 1599)_ presents a philosophy of Torah, and its status in the world. In the penultimate chapter of the work Maharal presents a disquisition on the Oral Torah. As in all his writings, he makes scant reference to sources other than the canonical rabbinic texts, let alone non-Jewish writers. Here on this page, in the penultimate chapter of the book (ch. 69, f. 62 col.c) Maharal refers to a discussion he had with a gentile scholar about religious dissension and the proliferation of Christians sects in his own time and among Jews in antiquity.\n\nThis reported conversation probably reveals a true picture of Maharal's life which was not restricted to the domain of the Jewish yeshivah, or the Klois, the academy for Jewish scholars, which he himself founded in Prague.\n\n### Kabbalistic Abridgments to the _Pardes Rimonim_: The Evolution of a Text\n\nAndrea Gondos\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/GondosCordovero900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/GondosGallico900%402x3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/GondosBaerdiagram900%402x4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/GondosBaertitle900%402x5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe abridgement as a separate literary genre came into its own in the age of printing, especially in sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when both readers and printers sought out condensed treatises to access original works in a more expedient way. For the consumer, digests facilitated the management of information, through the use of conceptual shortcuts, such as key concepts, representative passages and, at times, diagrams and visual aids. For the printer, the publication of abridgments, which were considerably shorter and physically smaller than the original work, offered the potential of wide circulation and economic profit.\n\nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century, three kabbalistic abridgments to Moses Cordovero's _Pardes Rimonim_ were printed within the same decade: _Pelah HaRimon_ written by the famous Rabbi and Kabbalist Menachem Azariah da Fano (Venice, 1600); Assis Rimonim, edited using the work of R. Samuel Gallico with the marginal notes of R. Mordechai Dato (Venice, 1601); and Pithei Yah, written by R. Yissachar Baer ben Petahyah Moshe (Prague, 1609). An important technical feature of the original work, the _Pardes Rimonim_, was the author's inclusion of kabbalistic diagrams, interspersed throughout the text for the purpose of providing visual illustration of certain kabbalistic concepts and processes. Yissachar Baer's abridgment uses only one visual aid, a schematic diagram representing the ten Sefirot. What is interesting however, is that the 1591-92 Krakow/Nowy Dvor edition of the _Pardes_ does not contain this diagram. Cordovero includes a similar sefirotic tree in Gate 7 of the _Pardes_, devoted to the explication of \"channels,\" which function as conduits connecting the _Sefirot_ and directing the divine emanation from one _Sefirah_ to the next, nevertheless this diagram is markedly different from the one Yissachar Baer uses. Fano's _Pelah ha-Rimon_ includes absolutely no kabbalistic diagrams, while Samuel Gallico's _Assis Rimonim_ reproduces the highest number of visual illustrations from the _Pardes_. Fano's clear stance against incorporating visual images into a printed text is corroborated by his removal of these images when he undertakes to correct the _Assis_ which gets finally reprinted devoid of any graphic representation in Mantua in 1623. The unique variance in the creative reproduction of texts and images in kabbalistic abridgments demonstrates the creative filtering of an abridger, who moves beyond mechanical reduction and creatively shapes the original work in ways consistent with his cultural, educational, and religious predispositions.\n\n### John Speed, _The Genealogies of Scripture_\n\nJeffrey Shoulson\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Shoulson900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nAccording to John Lightfoot's preface to the collected works of the sixteenth-century English Christian Hebraist, Hugh Broughton, \"Mr. John Speed, a man well known, was Overseer of the Press for \\[the printing of Broughton's _A Concent of Scripture_\\]: a Taylor by trade; but, by acquaintance with Mr. _Broughton,_ grown very Studious in the Scriptures, and by his directions grown very Skilfull in them. In the time, while the Concent was Printing, he, by Mr. Broughton's direction, gathered all the _Genealogies_ of the Bible into one View, and at the last they were Published under his name, in the form we have them before our Bibles. But it was Mr. Broughton, that directed, and digested them, and there are yet fair Manuscripts of them to be shewed, some whereof have the names in Hebrew, and Greek, and some in the Latine Letter, and in some of them Mr. Broughton's own handbo?=&.And yet when the Genealogie came to be Published, because the Bishops would not endure to have Mr. Broughton's name prefixed, Mr. Speed went away with all the credit, and profit: so, that he would confess, and it was no more then he had good reason to do it; That Mr. Broughton was a means under God of great Blessings to him, and his Children, for worldly comforts.\"\n\nIt's difficult to confirm all the details in Lightfoot's account, especially his assertion of existence of manuscripts by Broughton with earlier versions of the genealogies. What we do know is that in 1610, John Speed, who had achieved his early success as a cartographer, was granted a ten-year license to insert his 34-page engraving of _The genealogies of the scriptures, according to every familie and tribe_ in the soon-to-be-published King James version of the Bible. The genealogies of the scriptures was part of a package of readers' aids sold separately and designed to be bound at the beginning of the text. Speed's \"tables\" do appear to be based on those created by Broughton, which he adapted and expanded. Spee's version of the harmonizing of the conflicting genealogies in the gospels of Mathew and Luke follow exactly Brought's own extensive explication of the differences. The same can be said for the way Speed's charts address other discrepancies between the succession of Judean and Israelite monarchs in Kings and Chronicles.\n\nFor Broughton, the stakes for getting these chronologies right could not have been higher: \"this table by ignorance of Scripture grounde hath hardened Turkes: whose sworde the worde would haue turned to our good: hath hardened Iewes, to despise the ioyance of the Gospel: hath weakened Papistes to thinke the Gospell and Scripture vnexplicable: that weakened euen our selues to burst out into haynous notes, and barbarous rage against the openers of trueth.\" Moslems, Jews, and Catholics are looking to English Protestants to get their history right, Broughton seems to be suggesting, and as long as they don't, the English Church cannot expect the universal acknowledgement of Christian truth for which it should be striving. The impact of Broughton's extensive efforts in biblical chronology is long-lived, too. Not only do his calculations and genealogies come to shape the tables and charts that preceded the printed versions of the King James Bible through many of its early printings, they also served as the key basis for the work of James Ussher, Archbishop of Armaugh, whose _Annals of the Old Testament_, first published in 1650, is widely acknowledged as the source for Young Earth Creationism, the influence of which continues to be felt to this day.\n\n### The Arch of Lisbon's Merchants\n\nClaude Stuczynski\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Stuczynski900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe \"Arch of Lisbon's Merchants\" (\"Arco dos homens de negócios\") here depicted by the royal cartographer João Baptista de Lavanha (very probably, a Portuguese Converso) was the most impressive and luxurious manifestation to celebrate King Philip III's visit to Lisbon in 1619, as King Philip II of Portugal. The visit of the Habsburg Monarch aroused vivid expectations among Lisbon's \"men of commerce\" who were predominately _Conversos_. They hoped that the visit of the King would restore to the city its deserved role as the epicenter of the once-prosperous colonial trade in India. Decorated with classical, mythological themes and episodes of Iberian history (mostly Portuguese), the \"arch of the men of commerce\" explicitly celebrated King Manuel I past successful overseas enterprises. But this arch, I argue, also shared a theological-political implicit message: the need to revive King Manuel's integrative policies regarding the \"ablest\" and the \"richest\" among the _Conversos_. Portugal and its Habsburg King, were thereby called to fulfill the traditional role as protector and diffusor of Catholicism in the East with the help of Lisbon's prosperous businessmen. Claiming that, Conversos' \"men of commerce\" aimed to transform their negative image as suspected judaizers into useful and trustful subjects of the Crown, deserving to be promoted into the Old Christian elites.\n\n### \"The Most Accurate Hebrew Bible\"\n\nTheodor Dunkelgrün\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dunkelgrun900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe _Biblia Hebraica Accuratissima_ (Amsterdam: Joseph Athias 1666-67) is a monument in the histories of the Hebrew book and of Jewish-Christian relations. A remarkable example of seventeenth-century cross-confessional collaboration, it was edited by a team of Jewish scholars in Amsterdam and by a Calvinist Professor of Hebrew at the nearby University of Utrecht. The text was set by consulting earlier printed editions, Masoretic treatises and medieval Hebrew manuscripts that belonged to private Jewish libraries in Amsterdam, where the edition was published by the Portuguese-Jewish printer Joseph Athias. The edition came with printed approbations from the Rabbis of Amsterdam's Portuguese-Jewish Community (including the great Isaac Aboab da Fonseca, the first Rabbi in the New World when he led the Jewish community in Dutch Brazil) as well as theologians from all four universities in the Dutch Republic.\n\nPrinted some two centuries after the beginning of Hebrew printing, it seems to be the first edition of the Hebrew Bible to carry the approbation of both Christian and Jewish religious authorities. In the layout of the text itself, two completely different systems of textual division—the chapters and verses of the Christian tradition and verse, paragraph and weekly portion divisions of Jewish tradition—are superimposed. That made the text useful for both liturgical and scholarly purposes, and allowed Jews and Christians engaged in religious apologetics and polemics to efficiently refer to Scripture according to the tradition of the other, deepening a sense of a shared biblical culture.\n\nFamous for its accuracy, the so-called Leusden-Athias Bible remained the model for a very large number of later printings of the Hebrew Biblical text deep into the 19th century, including the first complete Hebrew Bible printed in America, in 1814, by another dynamic duo of Christian-Jewish collaboration, Thomas Dobson and Jonathan Horwitz, in Philadelphia.\n\nOne of the copies in the collection of the Library at the Katz Center, which belonged to Leon Gildesgame and before him to the Rev. Patrick Reynolds of Waterhead outside Manchester, has a beautifully hand-painted title page.\n\n### Compendia of Wisdom in Sephardi Amsterdam\n\nAnne Oravetz Albert\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/albert900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nAbraham Pereyra was a former _converso_ who turned to Judaism in Amsterdam in midlife. A leading figure in business and then a member of the lay governing council of the community, Pereyra also produced two books within six years: _La Certeza del Camino_ (\"The Certainty of the Path,\" 1666) and the one shown here, _Espejo de la Vanidad del Mundo_ (\"Mirror of the World's Vanity,\" 1671). Despite Pereyra's prominence in his own time, his books have received little attention in modern scholarship. They are essentially compilations or compendia of wisdom from diverse sources—Jewish and non-Jewish, ancient, medieval, and early modern—about how to lead a pious and virtuous life.\n\nAmong the many topics he addresses is the governance of the community. Calling it a \"republic\" and the lay leaders \"governors,\" he adapts early modern political philosophy and practical advice from the mirrors-for-princes genre, for the Jewish communal context. With anti-Machiavellian leanings, he inveighs against those who desired to separate religion from politics, insisting that governors must be personally pious and that government should adhere to strict religious dictates. Both books contain this kind of material, but the _Espejo_'s treatment is greatly revised and expanded from the first, suggesting that politics were a focus of his thinking in the intervening years. Pereyra's discussions are part of a widespread discourse regarding communal politics in the Sephardi community of Amsterdam in the second half of the seventeenth century.\n\n### Jewish Physicians and Christian Patients\n\nRobert Jütte\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/JutteDs124-S38-1714-Schudt1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nAmong the many external influences that seriously disrupted the medical practice of Jewish physicians beyond the Jewish quarter or ghetto walls were the various prohibitions issued by town councils, territorial rulers and ecclesiastical authorities. A tacit or even open acceptance of Jewish doctors was nevertheless a widespread phenomenon - not only in German lands. The vast corpus of anti-Judaic pamphlets and books testifies to the popularity of Jewish physicians in Christian communities. Famous Jew baiters, such as Johann Jacob Schudt (1664-1722), accused Jewish doctors of harming the body and soul of their Christian patients. They corroborated their reasoning with quotations from ecclesiastical texts containing injunctions against the medical practice of Jewish physicians. Another expert on Judaism, Johann Christoph Wagenseil (1633-1705), was more lenient. He stated in his work \"Feurtrag vom Juden-Teutsch\" (c. 1670) that in those places where there was no Christian physician present, patients were free to consult a Jewish doctor. If however a sick person had the opportunity to choose a Christian _medicus_, he should do so, unless he had good reasons to consult a Jewish healer, for example in the case of a greater expertise of the latter. Nonetheless, Wagenseil made it a rule that the Jewish doctor should restrict his cure to \"natural remedies\".\n\n### Johann Jacob Schudt, _Jüdisches Merckwürdigkeiten: Vorstellende was sich Curieuses und denckwürdiges in den neuern Zeiten_\n\nRachel Greenblatt\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200125031903im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/greenblattR800%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn May 1716, cities across the Holy Roman Empire celebrated the long-awaited birth of a son and heir to the throne to Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI and his wife, Elisabeth of Wolfenbüttel, with processions, illuminations and festivities of various sorts. This print depicts public celebrations held by the Jewish communities of Frankfurt and Prague. In the \"Franckfurter Jüdischer Aufzug\" (Frankfurt Jewish Procession) depicted above, rows of Jewish musicians lead a group of men through the city streets and into the synagogue, where, according to the accompanying text, rabbis preached sermons and psalms of thanksgiving were recite. The \"Prager Jüdischer Aufzug\" (Prague Jewish Procession) below shows a much more elaborately staged event, akin to a Baroque royal festival. Men on horseback lead classical and biblical figures, New World oddities, a large communal banner hoisted by the community's butchers and ritual slaughterers, rabbis and students, and more as they pass through a triumphal arch. In both cities, the political aim of showing homage to the royal family on this important occasion is coupled with a display of cultural integration including proficiency in musical, linguistic and artistic norms of the surrounding societies.\n\nThe print appeared as a fold-out insert in a small book originally published in 1716 by Christian Hebraist Johann Jacob Schudt as Jüdisches Franckfurter und Prager Freunden-Fest. In it, Schudt reprinted two publications written in German or Yiddish in Hebrew characters, one about events in Frankfurt and another from Prague. The reprinted original language of each publication is interspersed with German translations and explanations. To this, Schudt added his own highly derisive introduction, decrying the Jews' simultaneous arrogance and obsequiousness. The entire text of Jüdisches Franckfurter und Prager Freunden-Fest along with the illustration was then incorporated into the fourth volume of Schudt's monumental ethnography of Frankfurt Jewry, Jüdisches Merckwürdigkeiten, published two years later, four years after the first three volumes had appeared. Thus, celebratory events staged by Jews for Christian eyes, perhaps with Christian artistic collaboration of some sort, were reported upon and printed up by Jews for distribution and posterity, then reprinted by a Christian, with his own views added, for a mostly Christian audience that would also include—as Schudt remarks in his introduction to the fourth volume of Jüdisches Merckwürdigkeiten—some Jewish readers. While David Ruderman has described \"mingled identities\" as a characteristic typical of Jewish life in early modern Europe, this print reveals a mingled set of lenses through which Christian and Jewish views of each other were reflected and refracted.\n\n### _Sefer Mayim Rabim_: Adjudicating Jewish Communal Authority in 18th Century Livorno\n\nFrancesca Bregoli\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Bregoli900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe _Sefer Mayim Rabim_ (Amsterdam, 1737) is a four-volume collection of halakhic responsa by rabbi Raphael Meldola (1685-1748). Originally from Livorno, Meldola served as rabbi in Bayonne between 1721 and 1741. Despite his sometimes difficult relationship with the _parnasim_ (lay leaders) of the Livornese Jewish community, Meldola dedicated the third and fourth parts of his _Mayim Rabim_, dealing with halakhic questions of _Even hazer_ (family law) and _Hoshen mishpat_ (civil and criminal law), to them. This Spanish \"dedicatoria,\" which does not appear in all editions of the book, sheds light on the complexities of early modern Jewish communal authority.\n\nIn a move common to early modern dedications, Meldola confers quasi-authorship to the _parnasim_. Meldola states that he ought to dedicate the book to the _parnasim_ since he received the title of \"dayan\" from them in March 1710. He adds that the subject of the book matches their duties, as the Livornese lay leaders can adjudicate civil causes, \"a unique privilege that they enjoy, in contrast to other communities, through the special grace of His Royal Highness \\[the Grand Duke of Tuscany\\].\" Most intriguingly, Meldola remarks that \"a great part of the legal questions proposed in these volumes were already discussed and adjudicated in your illustrious _maamad.\"_ For this reason, the book's cases will gain even greater acceptance \"being _res judicata._\" It is known, however, that the Livornese _parnasim_ generally employed state and municipal law to adjudicate questions not strictly pertaining to the Jewish ritual sphere, such as commercial disputes in civil law cases, while the cases discussed in the volumes are approached through the lens of halakhah. Meldola's words thus offer tantalizing glimpses into possible tensions and overlaps between lay and rabbinic jurisdictions and into the competing authority of state and municipal law, on the one hand, and halakhah, on the other hand, in early modern Jewish communities.\n\n### The Copernican Turn in Early Modern Jewish Scientific Thought\n\nMatt Goldish\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/goldishcover900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/goldishspread900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nRaphael Levi Hannover (1685-1779) is a figure little known today to any but a handful of Jewish historians of the early modern period. He may have been, however, the first real Jewish Copernican—a true adherent of the heliocentric worldview at the center of the Scientific Revolution. In 1756 Hannover's student, Moses Yekutiel of Tiktin, published his notes on Hannover's lectures concerning astronomy, which include passages about Hannover's adoption of Copernicanism. The Katz Center at the University of Pennsylvania possesses a manuscript, possibly in Hannover's own hand, with the year \"1737\" stamped on its cover, with a significantly different version of Hannover's astronomical work. Among its other features is a series of illustrations showing the earlier Ptolemaic system with the earth at the center directly across from an illustration of the modern Copernican system with the sun at the center.\n\n### Science in 18th Century Ashkenaz: Sefer Oklidus (Euclid's _Elements_)\n\nIsrael Bartal\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/BartalEuclid-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Bartal-Slonim-approbation900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nOn December 9 1787 the renowned English philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) was traveling through Eastern Europe, where his brother Samuel, a prominent engineer and industrialist, was serving in the employ of Prince Potemkin and the empress Catherine the Great. Jeremy spent some time with his brother hoping to implement some of the innovative ideas that he was developing in his _Panopticon_. In the course of a journey through the town of Slonim (now in Belarus), Jeremy lodged the night with a Jew, a rabbi who was the proprietor of a hardware store.\n\nBentham was surprised to note that his host possessed two glass-enclosed bookcases that housed between 250 and 300 Hebrew volumes. The rabbi took particular pride in two scientific works in his collection: a book on astronomy to which he had added a diagram of his own, and a Hebrew edition of Euclid's _Elements_. It is possible to identify Bentham's unnamed hardware merchant as Rabbi Samson ben Mordecai (1734/6?- 1794) who presided over the rabbinical court of Slonim and whose name was signed to one of the letters of approbation accompanying R. Baruch of Shklov's translation of Euclid.\n\nThe volume was printed in The Hague in 1780. Rabbi Samson's words echoed the themes voiced by the translator, that Jews needed to familiarize themselves with the scientific curriculum in order to refute the accusations by hostile gentiles that they are a barbaric and ignorant people. Rabbi Elijah the Gaon of Vilna (1720-1797) was the one who commissioned Rabbi Baruch (Bendit) of Shklov to produce a Hebrew translation of Euclid's _Elements_: a work \"which elucidates the complete science of measurement, angles, rectangles, triangles, circles, ratios and values\" (as it states on the title page of the book).\n\n### Trees of Esoteric Knowledge\n\nYossi Chajes\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/chajesscroll900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/chajes1detail-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis circle at the center of this detail image from a late eighteenth century kabbalistic [\"ilan\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156/http://ilanot.haifa.ac.il/Ilanot_Site/ilanot.html) scroll depicts a very early cosmogonic process, according to the [Sarugian school of Lurianic kabbalah](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Sarug).

It forms part of at least twelve editions of six different _selihot_ rites printed in the Franconian city in the 1780s and 1790s. Among these editions, as we learn from an advertisement in the copy at hand, was one following the rite of Venice.\n\nWhy would a printing house located in southern Germany have wanted to publish a liturgical work that catered to the Jewish population of Ashkenazi descent living in Italy at the time? That population, after all, although highly invested in preserving its own identity when it first arrived in Italy after the expulsions from most of the German cities in the course of the fifteenth century, had begun to blend into the local scene of Italian-speaking Jews by the end of the sixteenth. The reason why their _selihot_ rite was printed in Fürth two hundred years later is given in the same ad: The Italo-Ashkenazi _selihot_ rite was followed not only in Venice and the Italian lands, but also, and perhaps more importantly, in the Franconian communities of Ansbach and Bamberg. Most likely, the edition printed in Fürth was not meant to be marketed in Italy at all but in an area much closer to home.\n\nHow did the Jews of Ansbach and Bamberg come to use the Italo-Ashkenazi _selihot_ rite? In fact, these _selihot_ had been among the first Hebrew books ever printed when they appeared in Piove di Sacco in c. 1475. In the following century, as the new technology spread across Europe, additional _selihot_ editions were published. Remarkably, while Jewish printers in Prague and Krakow each brought their own local rites to the press, the early editions published in the German lands followed the Italian model. It took until 1587 before the _selihot_ rite of the largest community that remained in western Ashkenaz, that of Frankfurt am Main, appeared in print, and another century before it was joined by editions representing the rites of other German communities. Meanwhile, the Jews resettling the towns and villages of early modern Germany had to go by whatever was available.\n\nBamberg and Ansbach, it seems, had not preserved a local tradition of their own. What made local Jews choose the Italo-Ashkenazi rite we cannot know. However, we do know that they continued to follow that rite well into the nineteenth century. Thus, the _selihot_ edition printed in Fürth testifies to the long-term impact the Ashkenazi diaspora in Italy had on their brethren elsewhere; at the same time, it offers a glimpse into the way the map of medieval Ashkenaz was redrawn in the wake of the transformations—expulsion, migration, and the invention of print—that marked the onset of early modernity.\n\n### Medicalizing Jew-hatred: the case of _Plica polonica_\n\nFrançois Guesnet\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Guesnet900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThroughout the early modern period, the matting of hair was discussed in academic literature and beyond as a medical condition pertaining to Eastern Europe. Ercole Sassonia (1551-1607), an influential professor of medicine at the University of Padua, named this condition _Plica polonica,_ in 1600, on the basis of letters from Poland describing the consequences of matting of hair in gruesome detail. Until the second half of the 19th century, hundreds of medical treatises discussed the causes and possible treatments of this allegedly harmful condition. Due to their high visibility in the region, Jews were often identified with the condition, and a frequent designation in German was _Judenzopf_ (Jewish plait). Ashkenazi Jews reflected non-Jewish popular medical approaches to the alleged condition in their own medical practices concerning matted hair, and a long discussion about its relevance in halakhic matters—especially pertaining to ritual purifications—referred to matted hair as _koltunish,_ the Yiddish equivalent to the Polish _kołtun._ De Lafontaine's treatise on the matter published in 1792 included among others an etching of a Jew with matted hair and beard, reproduced here. In no small part due to the illustrations, the publication had a massive influence on the academic discussion in the early 19th century, with Charles Darwin one of the latest authors assuming an endemic and contagious character of the condition.\n\n### Little Red Haired Jews and Red Skinned American Indians\n\nRebekka Voß\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/VossMendele-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/VossEven-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/VossEven-illustration900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn the Yiddish novel, _Kitser masoes Binyomin ha-shelishi_, first published in 1878, Mendele Mokher Seforim describes the travels of Benjamin the Third who sets off in search of the legendary Little Red Jews. These are the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, the heroes of one of the most vibrant myths in Jewish culture, who are commonly referred to as _royte yidelekh_ in Yiddish. Their unique coloring, not known from any other Jewish language, goes back to shared linguistic usage and folklore among Jews and Christians in late medieval and early modern German lands. Both German and Old Yiddish vernacular cultures were familiar with the myth of the Red Jews, a variant of the Ten Lost Tribes beyond the Sambatyon River imagined as having red hair and beards or a ruddy complexion.\n\nAround the same time that Mendele published his novel in Eastern Europe, across the Atlantic, Charles Even wrote a novel on Red Jews of his own that he published in 1861 with Philadelphia publisher J.B. Lippincott & Co. Unrelated to the Yiddish legend, Even identified the Lost Tribes of Israel with red skinned American Indians. In a late example of the Jewish Indian theory that had been popular especially in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries among Jews and Christians in Europe and America alike, Even tells the fictional story of a group of young Jews descending from the Lost Tribes who travel to America in an exodus of their own, in search of a life in peace and safety. When they land ashore the promised land, almost starved from the long journey, they gorge poisonous berries, from which their skin miraculously turns dark red! These Red Jews then intermarry with native American women: the origin of _The First of the Red Men_.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Albert, Anne Oravetz.** \"Post-sabbatian politics: reflections on governance among the Spanish and Portuguese Jews of Amsterdam, 1665-1683,\" (Ph.D. thesis: University of Pennsylvania, 2008)\n    \n*   **Bartal, Israel.** _The Jews of Eastern Europe, 1772-1881_. translated from Hebrew by Chaya Naor (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005)\n    \n*   **Beinart, Haim, ed.** _Moreshet Sepharad_ (The Sephardic Legacy).

This past year’s research group came together to bridge often disconnected areas of scholarship and to probe the meaning of an early modern era of Jewish history on its own terms. Borders and boundaries were understood geographically, but also as social, cultural, legal, political, and economic realities. Recognizing these connected histories helped us understand the internal divisions and new cultural movements and practices within Jewish society; careful study also revealed unexpected new relationships among Jews and non-Jews. In this year’s web exhibition, we highlight the boundary as both a dividing line and a place of meeting and mixing between different groups (Jewish and non-Jewish) in an attempt to shed light on the nature of early modern Jewry and the early modern period in general.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"a-choreography-of-sacred-readings-the-complutensian-polyglot-bible\">A Choreography of Sacred Readings: the Complutensian Polyglot Bible\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jesús de Prado Plumed\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dePradoPlumed900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The first editorial monument of early modern polyglot philology is the so-called Complutensian Polyglot Bible (ca. 1502-1517, only released after 1520) in six volumes, of which the library at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies possesses a complete copy. This complex biblical edition was the brainchild of Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros (1436-1517), the leading churchman in Spain at the turn of the sixteenth century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Modern scholars have traditionally described the editorial choices in the Complutensian Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts as a compromise by the Complutensian philologists with Jerome’s (Latin) Vulgate, also printed in this bible. Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts would have been modified to make them match Jerome’s translation. The texts as found in the Complutensian challenge this assumption. For instance, Jeremiah 7:18, ”… to make cakes to the queen of heaven” reads the same both in Jerome and in the Hebrew Bible. But the Complutensians innovate with a completely different reading, supposing a form “mele’khet,” with an aleph (“assignment; task”) instead of “melekhet” (“queen”), thus understanding: “to make cakes for a heavenly assignment”—following David Qimhi’s medieval exegesis. A telling example of an editorial work that was conceived to correct whenever deemed necessary by the editors’ own standards the biblical readings of the fathers of the Church and the Jewish biblical tradition altogether.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"a-hebrew-grammar-for-christian-scholars-abraham-de-balmes-mikneh-avram\">A Hebrew Grammar for Christian Scholars: Abraham De Balmes’ Mikneh Avram\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Fabrizio Lelli\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Lelli-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Lelli-intro900%402x3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Lelli-firstpage1200%402x4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“There are divine mysteries … in the words and the letters of the Holy text, mysteries that cannot be grasped on the basis of the Latin or Greek [versions of the Bible].” By these introductory words, Daniel Bomberg, the publisher of Abraham De Balmes’ Hebrew grammar \u003Cem>Mikneh Avram\u003C/em> (\u003Cem>The Possession of Abram\u003C/em>, Venice, 1523) explains why he decided to commit himself to print a new Hebrew grammar targeted to non-Jews. De Balmes, a talented physician, philosopher, and kabbalist (born in Southern Italy c. 1460, died in Venice c. 1523), is mainly known for his translations from Hebrew into Latin of the Averroistic corpus, sponsored by cardinal Domenico Grimani.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>De Balmes’ \u003Cem>Mikneh Avram\u003C/em> was the first Hebrew grammar addressed by a Jewish scholar to the non-Jewish audience of humanists who were eager to learn Hebrew and the Jewish Kabbalah. The Hebrew text is accompanied by a Latin translation carried out by De Balmes and completed, after the author’s death, by Kalonymos ben David Kalonymos. The interest of this edition, which had a wide circulation, resides in the special emphasis attributed to the syntax of Hebrew as well as in the combined use of Aristotelian logic and Kabbalistic allusions, a speculative pattern that characterized De Balmes’ intellectual research.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"censorship-in-a-time-of-religious-turmoil\">Censorship in a time of Religious Turmoil\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Piet Van Boxel\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/VanBoxelBomberg-1524-censor900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/VanBoxelBomberg-1524-expurgation900%402x3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The invention of the printing press in the middle of the 15th century revolutionized communication and book production in Europe, leading to a thus far unimaginable spread of knowledge. From its early days, Hebrew printing was part and parcel of this innovative device. A succinct introduction to its the history can be viewed on-line at the Penn Libraries’ Judaica exhibition “From Written to Printed Text: The Transmission of Jewish Tradition” of the David Katz Center for Judaic Studies.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The spread of knowledge, however, did not only unite people in their intellectual endeavors; it equally divided them in that it brought to light differences of opinion and ideological opposites. In a time of religious turmoil, the Roman Church considered that the most effective means of beating Luther’s Reformation was to control and restrict the spread of knowledge, a tactic that resulted in the ineffective tool of censorship. In order to make up for loss of believers the Church authorities also targeted the unbelievers through missionary activities, which did not leave the Jews in the Pontifical State untouched. Like the works of the reformers and their catholic sympathizers, the literary output of Jewish tradition was submitted to an ongoing process of expurgation. In an effort to deprive the Jews of the hope of redemption and the coming of their Messiah, and to accelerate their conversion, ecclesiastical censors were supposed to erase all such passages. Every contradiction of Christian doctrine or alleged offence against the Christian faith, the Church and its flock was to be removed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When looking at early Hebrew printing that had undergone pre-publication censorship or expurgation, one easily—given the predictable outcome of this authoritarian device—sees the inefficiency of this exercise of the Church: in censorship the obvious was left out or in case of expurgation the text, known by heart, was reinserted by hand. Jews have mostly repaired the scars left by the Church, thus making censorship an unsuccessful undertaking.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"chronicling-the-craft-of-printing-david-gans-tsemah-david\">Chronicling the Craft of Printing: David Gans’ Tsemah David\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Pavel Sládek\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Sladek900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Gans (1541-1613) resided in Bohemia and was one of the first Central-Eastern European private Jewish scholars.

For the consumer, digests facilitated the management of information, through the use of conceptual shortcuts, such as key concepts, representative passages and, at times, diagrams and visual aids. For the printer, the publication of abridgments, which were considerably shorter and physically smaller than the original work, offered the potential of wide circulation and economic profit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At the beginning of the seventeenth century, three kabbalistic abridgments to Moses Cordovero’s \u003Cem>Pardes Rimonim\u003C/em> were printed within the same decade: \u003Cem>Pelah HaRimon\u003C/em> written by the famous Rabbi and Kabbalist Menachem Azariah da Fano (Venice, 1600); Assis Rimonim, edited using the work of R. Samuel Gallico with the marginal notes of R. Mordechai Dato (Venice, 1601); and Pithei Yah, written by R. Yissachar Baer ben Petahyah Moshe (Prague, 1609). An important technical feature of the original work, the \u003Cem>Pardes Rimonim\u003C/em>, was the author’s inclusion of kabbalistic diagrams, interspersed throughout the text for the purpose of providing visual illustration of certain kabbalistic concepts and processes. Yissachar Baer’s abridgment uses only one visual aid, a schematic diagram representing the ten Sefirot. What is interesting however, is that the 1591-92 Krakow/Nowy Dvor edition of the \u003Cem>Pardes\u003C/em> does not contain this diagram. Cordovero includes a similar sefirotic tree in Gate 7 of the \u003Cem>Pardes\u003C/em>, devoted to the explication of “channels,” which function as conduits connecting the \u003Cem>Sefirot\u003C/em> and directing the divine emanation from one \u003Cem>Sefirah\u003C/em> to the next, nevertheless this diagram is markedly different from the one Yissachar Baer uses. Fano’s \u003Cem>Pelah ha-Rimon\u003C/em> includes absolutely no kabbalistic diagrams, while Samuel Gallico’s \u003Cem>Assis Rimonim\u003C/em> reproduces the highest number of visual illustrations from the \u003Cem>Pardes\u003C/em>. Fano’s clear stance against incorporating visual images into a printed text is corroborated by his removal of these images when he undertakes to correct the \u003Cem>Assis\u003C/em> which gets finally reprinted devoid of any graphic representation in Mantua in 1623. The unique variance in the creative reproduction of texts and images in kabbalistic abridgments demonstrates the creative filtering of an abridger, who moves beyond mechanical reduction and creatively shapes the original work in ways consistent with his cultural, educational, and religious predispositions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"john-speed-the-genealogies-of-scripture\">John Speed, \u003Cem>The Genealogies of Scripture\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jeffrey Shoulson\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Shoulson900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>According to John Lightfoot’s preface to the collected works of the sixteenth-century English Christian Hebraist, Hugh Broughton, “Mr. John Speed, a man well known, was Overseer of the Press for [the printing of Broughton’s \u003Cem>A Concent of Scripture\u003C/em>]: a Taylor by trade; but, by acquaintance with Mr. \u003Cem>Broughton,\u003C/em> grown very Studious in the Scriptures, and by his directions grown very Skilfull in them. In the time, while the Concent was Printing, he, by Mr. Broughton’s direction, gathered all the \u003Cem>Genealogies\u003C/em> of the Bible into one View, and at the last they were Published under his name, in the form we have them before our Bibles. But it was Mr. Broughton, that directed, and digested them, and there are yet fair Manuscripts of them to be shewed, some whereof have the names in Hebrew, and Greek, and some in the Latine Letter, and in some of them Mr. Broughton’s own handbo?=&#x26;.And yet when the Genealogie came to be Published, because the Bishops would not endure to have Mr. Broughton’s name prefixed, Mr. Speed went away with all the credit, and profit: so, that he would confess, and it was no more then he had good reason to do it; That Mr. Broughton was a means under God of great Blessings to him, and his Children, for worldly comforts.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s difficult to confirm all the details in Lightfoot’s account, especially his assertion of existence of manuscripts by Broughton with earlier versions of the genealogies. What we do know is that in 1610, John Speed, who had achieved his early success as a cartographer, was granted a ten-year license to insert his 34-page engraving of \u003Cem>The genealogies of the scriptures, according to every familie and tribe\u003C/em> in the soon-to-be-published King James version of the Bible. The genealogies of the scriptures was part of a package of readers’ aids sold separately and designed to be bound at the beginning of the text. Speed’s “tables” do appear to be based on those created by Broughton, which he adapted and expanded. Spee’s version of the harmonizing of the conflicting genealogies in the gospels of Mathew and Luke follow exactly Brought’s own extensive explication of the differences. The same can be said for the way Speed’s charts address other discrepancies between the succession of Judean and Israelite monarchs in Kings and Chronicles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For Broughton, the stakes for getting these chronologies right could not have been higher: “this table by ignorance of Scripture grounde hath hardened Turkes: whose sworde the worde would haue turned to our good: hath hardened Iewes, to despise the ioyance of the Gospel: hath weakened Papistes to thinke the Gospell and Scripture vnexplicable: that weakened euen our selues to burst out into haynous notes, and barbarous rage against the openers of trueth.” Moslems, Jews, and Catholics are looking to English Protestants to get their history right, Broughton seems to be suggesting, and as long as they don’t, the English Church cannot expect the universal acknowledgement of Christian truth for which it should be striving. The impact of Broughton’s extensive efforts in biblical chronology is long-lived, too. Not only do his calculations and genealogies come to shape the tables and charts that preceded the printed versions of the King James Bible through many of its early printings, they also served as the key basis for the work of James Ussher, Archbishop of Armaugh, whose \u003Cem>Annals of the Old Testament\u003C/em>, first published in 1650, is widely acknowledged as the source for Young Earth Creationism, the influence of which continues to be felt to this day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-arch-of-lisbons-merchants\">The Arch of Lisbon’s Merchants\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Claude Stuczynski\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Stuczynski900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The “Arch of Lisbon’s Merchants” (“Arco dos homens de negócios”) here depicted by the royal cartographer João Baptista de Lavanha (very probably, a Portuguese Converso) was the most impressive and luxurious manifestation to celebrate King Philip III’s visit to Lisbon in 1619, as King Philip II of Portugal. The visit of the Habsburg Monarch aroused vivid expectations among Lisbon’s “men of commerce” who were predominately \u003Cem>Conversos\u003C/em>. They hoped that the visit of the King would restore to the city its deserved role as the epicenter of the once-prosperous colonial trade in India. Decorated with classical, mythological themes and episodes of Iberian history (mostly Portuguese), the “arch of the men of commerce” explicitly celebrated King Manuel I past successful overseas enterprises. But this arch, I argue, also shared a theological-political implicit message: the need to revive King Manuel’s integrative policies regarding the “ablest” and the “richest” among the \u003Cem>Conversos\u003C/em>. Portugal and its Habsburg King, were thereby called to fulfill the traditional role as protector and diffusor of Catholicism in the East with the help of Lisbon’s prosperous businessmen.

A remarkable example of seventeenth-century cross-confessional collaboration, it was edited by a team of Jewish scholars in Amsterdam and by a Calvinist Professor of Hebrew at the nearby University of Utrecht. The text was set by consulting earlier printed editions, Masoretic treatises and medieval Hebrew manuscripts that belonged to private Jewish libraries in Amsterdam, where the edition was published by the Portuguese-Jewish printer Joseph Athias. The edition came with printed approbations from the Rabbis of Amsterdam’s Portuguese-Jewish Community (including the great Isaac Aboab da Fonseca, the first Rabbi in the New World when he led the Jewish community in Dutch Brazil) as well as theologians from all four universities in the Dutch Republic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Printed some two centuries after the beginning of Hebrew printing, it seems to be the first edition of the Hebrew Bible to carry the approbation of both Christian and Jewish religious authorities. In the layout of the text itself, two completely different systems of textual division—the chapters and verses of the Christian tradition and verse, paragraph and weekly portion divisions of Jewish tradition—are superimposed.

Despite Pereyra’s prominence in his own time, his books have received little attention in modern scholarship.

Both books contain this kind of material, but the \u003Cem>Espejo\u003C/em>’s treatment is greatly revised and expanded from the first, suggesting that politics were a focus of his thinking in the intervening years.

The vast corpus of anti-Judaic pamphlets and books testifies to the popularity of Jewish physicians in Christian communities. Famous Jew baiters, such as Johann Jacob Schudt (1664-1722), accused Jewish doctors of harming the body and soul of their Christian patients. They corroborated their reasoning with quotations from ecclesiastical texts containing injunctions against the medical practice of Jewish physicians. Another expert on Judaism, Johann Christoph Wagenseil (1633-1705), was more lenient. He stated in his work “Feurtrag vom Juden-Teutsch” (c. 1670) that in those places where there was no Christian physician present, patients were free to consult a Jewish doctor. If however a sick person had the opportunity to choose a Christian \u003Cem>medicus\u003C/em>, he should do so, unless he had good reasons to consult a Jewish healer, for example in the case of a greater expertise of the latter.

In the “Franckfurter Jüdischer Aufzug” (Frankfurt Jewish Procession) depicted above, rows of Jewish musicians lead a group of men through the city streets and into the synagogue, where, according to the accompanying text, rabbis preached sermons and psalms of thanksgiving were recite. The “Prager Jüdischer Aufzug” (Prague Jewish Procession) below shows a much more elaborately staged event, akin to a Baroque royal festival. Men on horseback lead classical and biblical figures, New World oddities, a large communal banner hoisted by the community’s butchers and ritual slaughterers, rabbis and students, and more as they pass through a triumphal arch. In both cities, the political aim of showing homage to the royal family on this important occasion is coupled with a display of cultural integration including proficiency in musical, linguistic and artistic norms of the surrounding societies.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The print appeared as a fold-out insert in a small book originally published in 1716 by Christian Hebraist Johann Jacob Schudt as Jüdisches Franckfurter und Prager Freunden-Fest. In it, Schudt reprinted two publications written in German or Yiddish in Hebrew characters, one about events in Frankfurt and another from Prague. The reprinted original language of each publication is interspersed with German translations and explanations. To this, Schudt added his own highly derisive introduction, decrying the Jews’ simultaneous arrogance and obsequiousness. The entire text of Jüdisches Franckfurter und Prager Freunden-Fest along with the illustration was then incorporated into the fourth volume of Schudt’s monumental ethnography of Frankfurt Jewry, Jüdisches Merckwürdigkeiten, published two years later, four years after the first three volumes had appeared. Thus, celebratory events staged by Jews for Christian eyes, perhaps with Christian artistic collaboration of some sort, were reported upon and printed up by Jews for distribution and posterity, then reprinted by a Christian, with his own views added, for a mostly Christian audience that would also include—as Schudt remarks in his introduction to the fourth volume of Jüdisches Merckwürdigkeiten—some Jewish readers. While David Ruderman has described “mingled identities” as a characteristic typical of Jewish life in early modern Europe, this print reveals a mingled set of lenses through which Christian and Jewish views of each other were reflected and refracted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"sefer-mayim-rabim-adjudicating-jewish-communal-authority-in-18th-century-livorno\">\u003Cem>Sefer Mayim Rabim\u003C/em>: Adjudicating Jewish Communal Authority in 18th Century Livorno\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Francesca Bregoli\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Bregoli900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cem>Sefer Mayim Rabim\u003C/em> (Amsterdam, 1737) is a four-volume collection of halakhic responsa by rabbi Raphael Meldola (1685-1748). Originally from Livorno, Meldola served as rabbi in Bayonne between 1721 and 1741. Despite his sometimes difficult relationship with the \u003Cem>parnasim\u003C/em> (lay leaders) of the Livornese Jewish community, Meldola dedicated the third and fourth parts of his \u003Cem>Mayim Rabim\u003C/em>, dealing with halakhic questions of \u003Cem>Even hazer\u003C/em> (family law) and \u003Cem>Hoshen mishpat\u003C/em> (civil and criminal law), to them. This Spanish “dedicatoria,” which does not appear in all editions of the book, sheds light on the complexities of early modern Jewish communal authority.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In a move common to early modern dedications, Meldola confers quasi-authorship to the \u003Cem>parnasim\u003C/em>. Meldola states that he ought to dedicate the book to the \u003Cem>parnasim\u003C/em> since he received the title of “dayan” from them in March 1710. He adds that the subject of the book matches their duties, as the Livornese lay leaders can adjudicate civil causes, “a unique privilege that they enjoy, in contrast to other communities, through the special grace of His Royal Highness [the Grand Duke of Tuscany].” Most intriguingly, Meldola remarks that “a great part of the legal questions proposed in these volumes were already discussed and adjudicated in your illustrious \u003Cem>maamad.”\u003C/em> For this reason, the book’s cases will gain even greater acceptance “being \u003Cem>res judicata.\u003C/em>” It is known, however, that the Livornese \u003Cem>parnasim\u003C/em> generally employed state and municipal law to adjudicate questions not strictly pertaining to the Jewish ritual sphere, such as commercial disputes in civil law cases, while the cases discussed in the volumes are approached through the lens of halakhah. Meldola’s words thus offer tantalizing glimpses into possible tensions and overlaps between lay and rabbinic jurisdictions and into the competing authority of state and municipal law, on the one hand, and halakhah, on the other hand, in early modern Jewish communities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-copernican-turn-in-early-modern-jewish-scientific-thought\">The Copernican Turn in Early Modern Jewish Scientific Thought\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Matt Goldish\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/goldishcover900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/goldishspread900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Raphael Levi Hannover (1685-1779) is a figure little known today to any but a handful of Jewish historians of the early modern period. He may have been, however, the first real Jewish Copernican—a true adherent of the heliocentric worldview at the center of the Scientific Revolution. In 1756 Hannover’s student, Moses Yekutiel of Tiktin, published his notes on Hannover’s lectures concerning astronomy, which include passages about Hannover’s adoption of Copernicanism. The Katz Center at the University of Pennsylvania possesses a manuscript, possibly in Hannover’s own hand, with the year “1737” stamped on its cover, with a significantly different version of Hannover’s astronomical work. Among its other features is a series of illustrations showing the earlier Ptolemaic system with the earth at the center directly across from an illustration of the modern Copernican system with the sun at the center.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"science-in-18th-century-ashkenaz-sefer-oklidus-euclids-elements\">Science in 18th Century Ashkenaz: Sefer Oklidus (Euclid’s \u003Cem>Elements\u003C/em>)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Israel Bartal\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/BartalEuclid-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Bartal-Slonim-approbation900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On December 9 1787 the renowned English philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) was traveling through Eastern Europe, where his brother Samuel, a prominent engineer and industrialist, was serving in the employ of Prince Potemkin and the empress Catherine the Great. Jeremy spent some time with his brother hoping to implement some of the innovative ideas that he was developing in his \u003Cem>Panopticon\u003C/em>. In the course of a journey through the town of Slonim (now in Belarus), Jeremy lodged the night with a Jew, a rabbi who was the proprietor of a hardware store.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bentham was surprised to note that his host possessed two glass-enclosed bookcases that housed between 250 and 300 Hebrew volumes. The rabbi took particular pride in two scientific works in his collection: a book on astronomy to which he had added a diagram of his own, and a Hebrew edition of Euclid’s \u003Cem>Elements\u003C/em>. It is possible to identify Bentham’s unnamed hardware merchant as Rabbi Samson ben Mordecai (1734/6?- 1794) who presided over the rabbinical court of Slonim and whose name was signed to one of the letters of approbation accompanying R. Baruch of Shklov’s translation of Euclid.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The volume was printed in The Hague in 1780. Rabbi Samson’s words echoed the themes voiced by the translator, that Jews needed to familiarize themselves with the scientific curriculum in order to refute the accusations by hostile gentiles that they are a barbaric and ignorant people. Rabbi Elijah the Gaon of Vilna (1720-1797) was the one who commissioned Rabbi Baruch (Bendit) of Shklov to produce a Hebrew translation of Euclid’s \u003Cem>Elements\u003C/em>: a work “which elucidates the complete science of measurement, angles, rectangles, triangles, circles, ratios and values” (as it states on the title page of the book).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"trees-of-esoteric-knowledge\">Trees of Esoteric Knowledge\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Yossi Chajes\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/chajesscroll900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/chajes1detail-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This circle at the center of this detail image from a late eighteenth century kabbalistic \u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156/http://ilanot.haifa.ac.il/Ilanot_Site/ilanot.html\">“ilan”\u003C/a> scroll depicts a very early cosmogonic process, according to the \u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Sarug\">Sarugian school of Lurianic kabbalah\u003C/a>.

It forms part of at least twelve editions of six different \u003Cem>selihot\u003C/em> rites printed in the Franconian city in the 1780s and 1790s. Among these editions, as we learn from an advertisement in the copy at hand, was one following the rite of Venice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Why would a printing house located in southern Germany have wanted to publish a liturgical work that catered to the Jewish population of Ashkenazi descent living in Italy at the time? That population, after all, although highly invested in preserving its own identity when it first arrived in Italy after the expulsions from most of the German cities in the course of the fifteenth century, had begun to blend into the local scene of Italian-speaking Jews by the end of the sixteenth. The reason why their \u003Cem>selihot\u003C/em> rite was printed in Fürth two hundred years later is given in the same ad: The Italo-Ashkenazi \u003Cem>selihot\u003C/em> rite was followed not only in Venice and the Italian lands, but also, and perhaps more importantly, in the Franconian communities of Ansbach and Bamberg. Most likely, the edition printed in Fürth was not meant to be marketed in Italy at all but in an area much closer to home.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How did the Jews of Ansbach and Bamberg come to use the Italo-Ashkenazi \u003Cem>selihot\u003C/em> rite? In fact, these \u003Cem>selihot\u003C/em> had been among the first Hebrew books ever printed when they appeared in Piove di Sacco in c. 1475. In the following century, as the new technology spread across Europe, additional \u003Cem>selihot\u003C/em> editions were published. Remarkably, while Jewish printers in Prague and Krakow each brought their own local rites to the press, the early editions published in the German lands followed the Italian model. It took until 1587 before the \u003Cem>selihot\u003C/em> rite of the largest community that remained in western Ashkenaz, that of Frankfurt am Main, appeared in print, and another century before it was joined by editions representing the rites of other German communities. Meanwhile, the Jews resettling the towns and villages of early modern Germany had to go by whatever was available.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bamberg and Ansbach, it seems, had not preserved a local tradition of their own. What made local Jews choose the Italo-Ashkenazi rite we cannot know. However, we do know that they continued to follow that rite well into the nineteenth century. Thus, the \u003Cem>selihot\u003C/em> edition printed in Fürth testifies to the long-term impact the Ashkenazi diaspora in Italy had on their brethren elsewhere; at the same time, it offers a glimpse into the way the map of medieval Ashkenaz was redrawn in the wake of the transformations—expulsion, migration, and the invention of print—that marked the onset of early modernity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"medicalizing-jew-hatred-the-case-of-plica-polonica\">Medicalizing Jew-hatred: the case of \u003Cem>Plica polonica\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>François Guesnet\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Guesnet900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Throughout the early modern period, the matting of hair was discussed in academic literature and beyond as a medical condition pertaining to Eastern Europe. Ercole Sassonia (1551-1607), an influential professor of medicine at the University of Padua, named this condition \u003Cem>Plica polonica,\u003C/em> in 1600, on the basis of letters from Poland describing the consequences of matting of hair in gruesome detail. Until the second half of the 19th century, hundreds of medical treatises discussed the causes and possible treatments of this allegedly harmful condition. Due to their high visibility in the region, Jews were often identified with the condition, and a frequent designation in German was \u003Cem>Judenzopf\u003C/em> (Jewish plait). Ashkenazi Jews reflected non-Jewish popular medical approaches to the alleged condition in their own medical practices concerning matted hair, and a long discussion about its relevance in halakhic matters—especially pertaining to ritual purifications—referred to matted hair as \u003Cem>koltunish,\u003C/em> the Yiddish equivalent to the Polish \u003Cem>kołtun.\u003C/em> De Lafontaine’s treatise on the matter published in 1792 included among others an etching of a Jew with matted hair and beard, reproduced here. In no small part due to the illustrations, the publication had a massive influence on the academic discussion in the early 19th century, with Charles Darwin one of the latest authors assuming an endemic and contagious character of the condition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"little-red-haired-jews-and-red-skinned-american-indians\">Little Red Haired Jews and Red Skinned American Indians\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Rebekka Voß\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/VossMendele-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/VossEven-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901104156im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/VossEven-illustration900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the Yiddish novel, \u003Cem>Kitser masoes Binyomin ha-shelishi\u003C/em>, first published in 1878, Mendele Mokher Seforim describes the travels of Benjamin the Third who sets off in search of the legendary Little Red Jews. These are the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, the heroes of one of the most vibrant myths in Jewish culture, who are commonly referred to as \u003Cem>royte yidelekh\u003C/em> in Yiddish. Their unique coloring, not known from any other Jewish language, goes back to shared linguistic usage and folklore among Jews and Christians in late medieval and early modern German lands.

Diverse phenomena such as the creation of new philosophic and scientific cultures, the emergence of medieval halakhah (Jewish legal praxis), the diffusion of Kabbalah, the establishment of new mendicant orders, the institutionalization of Sufi brotherhoods, the rise of universities, and the role of inquisitors were studied, not only as isolated phenomena but in their mutual interrelations. In this on-line exhibition we highlight a number of original sources that were draw upon by these scholars in the course of their research: Hebrew, Latin and Arabic manuscripts and early printed texts which illustrate a range of topics such as medieval liturgical poetry, law, rhetoric, philosophy, science, magic, social history, gender relations, inter-communal contact, conflict and other forms of entanglement both positive and negative.\n\nExhibition cover design adapted from a decorative incipit and illuminated motifs found in a 13th-century Latin translation of an Arabic medical treatise by a 9th/10th-century Jewish physician (Isaac Israeli/Abu Ya'qub Ishaq ibn Suleiman al-Isra'ili)) to the Fatimid Caliph Ubaid Allah al-Mahdi (909-34) in Qairawan (found in present-day Tunisia). The original codex, a miscellany of the fundamental medical textbooks of thirteenth-century Paris, is found in the Lawrence J. Schoenberg Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries, manuscript 24 (decorative elements on folio 51 verso, 52 recto and elsewhere).

It was copied during the fourteenth century, probably in the Rhineland area of southern Germany and northern Italy. It contains the liturgical poetry (\\_piyyutim\\_) recited in the synagogue on both days of _Rosh ha-shanah_, on Yom Kippur, on the first and second day of _Sukkot_, the intermediate Sabbath during _Sukkot_ and on _Shemini Atseret_, but it lacks most of the standard prayers said on these occasions because the precentor would have known these by heart. Today, the volume is incomplete, beginning with _musaf_ (the additional prayers) recited on the first day of _Rosh ha-shanah_ and ending with _musaf_ on _Shemini Atseret._ In its complete form it would have contained more than 280 folio leaves (rather than the extant 252 folios). In addition to at least two quires missing at the beginning and one quire missing at the end, several pages have been cut out of the manuscript. The manuscript was rebound in (early) modern times and apparently after that was damaged, probably by fire.\n\nDuring the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, several changes took place in the production of liturgical manuscripts in Ashkenaz that influenced both the selection of texts and the appearance of the texts on the page. Notwithstanding unifying tendencies, many communities retained their local traditions about which piyyutim to say when, as mirrored by the unusual ordering of _yotsrot_ for _Sukkot_ in the Katz Center's _mahzor_. Most textual changes that spread throughout many communities pertain to the omission of _piyyutim_, e.g. many communities decided to abbreviate the recitation of _qedushta'ot,_ the complex compositions adorning the _Amidah_ on Sabbaths and holidays, by skipping parts of the _rehitim,_ the series of highly structured poems in the penultimate position of the _qedushta,_ especially on the high holidays when many _piyyutim_ were recited. The _mahzor_ of the Katz Center displays a selection that is largely in accordance with later habits, although in one case a _piyyut_ that had been omitted by the original scribe was added on the margins by an almost contemporary hand (f. 143r). This note was preserved when the margins were cut at a later time, suggesting that the community using the _mahzor_ continued to recite this _piyyut_. Interestingly, the _mahzor_ does not share another textual change of the late thirteenth, early fourteenth century, namely the omission of the strings of verses inserted into the first three _piyyutim_ of _qedushta'ot,_ although it rarely contains more than three or four verses, even though earlier manuscripts may have up to seven or eight verses in each string.\n\nAmong the _piyyutim_ retained by the original scribe were two anti-Christian piyyutim in the _rehitim_ for _shaharit_ on Yom Kippur that would have appealed to the Jewish communities in Ashkenaz in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries who could use the liturgy to express their antagonism to Christianity in times of growing tension, but apparently these _piyyutim_ were considered to be superfluous or even dangerous at a later time, when the leafs containing this _piyyutim_ were cut from the _mahzor_ (f. 105 and 108). Only one occasion of the _Aleynu_ is censored (by erasure) while another occasion of the same text was not changed. It is not possible to reconstruct when this drastic measure was taken, nor whether it is a case of self-censure or due only to outside pressure. Cutting out the _piyyutim_ was eased by the selective recitation of _rehitim_ that began in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and had led to the omission of some _rehitim_ from the manuscript.\n\nThe aesthetic changes in the visual appearance of liturgical manuscripts in Ashkenaz developed during the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. Changes in parchment manufacturing brought about a more generous layout with lavish margins, ample space between the lines, sumptuous initial words and—by the end of the thirteenth century—intricate visualizations of poetic structures like acrostics, stanzas, hemistichs and recurring elements. The Katz Center's _mahzor_ displays most of these, although the margins were cut by approximately 1.8 inches on one side, probably by a little less on the other sides, when the volume was rebound in (early) modern times, changing the appearance of the page dramatically, even though the layout is still generous. Some liturgical manuscripts from the fourteenth century use color to mark structure in poetic texts, e.g. for acrostics or biblical verses at the end of stanzas. The _mahzor_ of the Katz Center uses black ink only, with the exception of some dots around the letters of initial words in the _Hosha'anot_ section and the same red ink in the decoration of the beginning of this section. The scribe took however great care to create well-structured and diversified pages with marked acrostics and poetic structures, using larger letters and short lines, sometimes creating the impression of columns of text. He enlarged the initial words of all _piyyutim_ and created major word initials for the complex compositions. The tradition to pay special attention to the beginning pages of _yotsrot_ is attested in Ashkenazic mahzorim since the early thirteenth century, and it seems to have guided the scribe of this _mahzor_: The initial word of the _yotser_ for the second day of Rosh ha-shanah is framed in a decorated panel, the initial word of the _kol nidre_ is gilded. Other pages they might have contained decorated panels at the beginnings of other _yotsrot_ are missing (first day of Rosh ha-shanah at the beginning) or were cut from the manuscript (second day of _Sukkot_, _Shemini Atseret_). The initial word of the _yotser_ for the intermediate Sabbath of _Sukkot_ (f. 210r) is peculiar in that a decorated panel was cut from the page and a parchment patch was inserted, reconstructing the text on both sides of the patch in a later but careful hand. Even though the manuscript does not contain illustrations, which can be found in many contemporary _mahzorim_, but used geometrical designs to decorate the panels for the initial words, it is likely that the missing pages from the beginning of _yotsrot_ were cut out in order to be collected or displayed as examples of beautiful medieval manuscripts.\n\n### Rabbi Isaac ben Moses and his _Sefer Or Zaru'a_\n\nEphraim Kanarfogel\n\n![zaru'a](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/zaru%27a.jpg)\n\nRabbi Isaac b. Moses (d. c. 1250) appears to have hailed from Bohemia. He studied in both Germany and northern France with a bevy of the leading Tosafist glossators of his day, including Simhah ben Samuel of Speyer, Eliezer b. Joel (Rabiah) _ha-Levi_ of Cologne, Judah b. Isaac Sirleon of Paris, and Samson of Coucy, and he also studied with the founder of the German Pietists, Judah b. Samuel the Pious. The geographic diversity of Isaac's teachers, which renewed a trend that dated from the mid-twelfth century in Ashkenazic lands but had become attenuated for a period of about forty years (c. 1175-1215), gave Isaac access to both the German and north French centers of Tosafist endeavors, and to a rich array of their writings in the fields of talmudic commentary and Jewish law.\n\nNot surprisingly, Isaac's _magnum opus,_ Sefer Or Zaru'a, is a large and discursive work that covers a wide range of legal topics. The sheer size of the work caused Isaac's son, Hayyim, to comprise a rather drastic abridgement, and also helps to explain the seeming unavailability of this work for a period of close to 400 years, until the first phase of its publication in Zhitomir in 1862.\n\nIsaac was a careful recorder of his teachers' rulings and religious practices, and of the challenges that they and their predecessors faced in their respective communities. Isaac mentions in passing the forms or ornaments that had to be displayed on one's clothing—as mandated by the Christian authorities—even on the Sabbath, which he observed during his student days in northern France. This is perhaps one of the earliest references to Jews actually wearing the badge that had been mandated by the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215.\n\n### Bonds of Friendship: A Shared Biblical Tradition\n\nRuth Karras\n\n![morgan.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/morgan.jpg)\n\nDavid and Jonathan were the paradigm of male friendship in both the Christian and Jewish Middle Ages. Their bond was understood in both traditions as following in the classical pattern of friendships, especially in a military context, between an older and a younger man, and by the later Middle Ages in both Christian and Jewish culture took on the trappings of chivalry. The story was retold in prose and verse, in Latin and a variety of medieval vernaculars, including Yiddish, and Christian and Jewish biblical commentators used it to make a variety of points, only some of which related to the nature of male friendship.\n\nIn a magnificent thirteenth-century book of Bible illustrations mostly contained in Morgan Library MS 638, folio 28 verso, we find this illustration of 1 Samuel 17 and 18. David, as a youth, killed Goliath, and Jonathan, the son of King Saul, was so taken with him that he \"loved him as himself\" and they made a covenant, after which Jonathan gave David his cloak, weapons and sword-belt.\n\nThe book was made in France around the middle of the thirteenth century, with the Latin text added during the subsequent century. In 1608 the book was given as a gift to Shah Abbas, who had the Latin text translated into Persian; later, text in Judeo-Persian was added.\n\n### A Hebrew Christian Calendar\n\nElisheva Baumgarten\n \n![baumgartenv900@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/baumgartenv900%402x.jpg)\n![baumgartenr900@2x1.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/baumgartenr900%402x1.jpg)\n\nThis late thirteenth-century Hebrew volume, known as the Northern French Hebrew Miscellany (Falter Facsimile Editions; British Library 11639), is among the most beautiful extant illuminated Hebrew manuscripts copied by a man noted in the colophon as Benjamin the Scribe. As in many medieval Hebrew liturgical compendia, this collection includes numerous Jewish calendric computations as well as a complex diagram of the signs of the zodiac.\n\nGuided by the zodiac, a Christian calendar written in Hebrew, one of the earliest such calendar known to date, was inserted towards the end of the manuscript (fol. 542v). Each of the four corners of this page provides instructions for calculating the equinox or solstice times, standard components of Jewish calendars that in most Hebrew manuscripts are not linked to the Christian calendar. The inner triangle records the annual ecclesiastic calendar, detailing its four 13-week periods, reflecting its four-part economic division of the year. The concentric circles that surround the triangle outlined the different saints' days celebrated by the Christians. These are evidence of the intimate acquaintance medieval Jews had with the Christian ritual cycle and with the importance of this knowledge that provided guidelines for business and social relations.\n\n### _Sefer ha-Temunah_\n\nEhud Krinis\n\n![krinis900@2x.jpg](/assets/images/13thCentury/krinis900%402x.jpg)\n \nPictured here is the front page of the Lemberg 1892 edition of _Sefer ha-Temunah_ (the _Book of the Image_). This anonymous work is considered a classical exposition of the Kabbalistic world cycles doctrine (Hebrew: _Torat ha-Shemitot_). Gershom Scholem, in his groundbreaking studies on the origins of the Kabbalah, considered this text to be a product of the Gerona circle, the earliest Kabbalistic circle in Spain, whose activities are traced to the first half of the thirteenth century. Late in his life Scholem acknowledged that his conclusions about the date and the historical circumstances of _Sefer ha-Temunah_ are unsustainable. Subsequent studies carried by Efraim Gottlieb and especially by Moshe Idel suggested that _Sefer ha-Temunah_ was written well into the Fourteenth century by a Kabbalist who most probably lived outside Spain. The reassessment concerning of the time and the place of _Sefer ha-Temunah_ open the door for a new understanding regarding the development of the world cycles doctrine in early Kabbalah. Rather than emerging suddenly, it seems now that the world cycles doctrine was developing gradually, from its concise formulations in writings of the Gerona circle of Kabbalists of the first half of the thirteenth century, to the elaborate expositions of works such as _Ma'arekhet ha-Elohut_ (\\_The Divine System\\_) and _Sefer ha-Temunah,_ about a century later.\n\n### The reception of Raymond Martí's _Pugio fidei_ in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries\n\nAlexander Fidora\n\n![img_3.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/img_3.png)\n\n![fidora900@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/fidora900%402x.jpg)\nThe Catalan Dominican Ramon Martí is generally considered to be the first Christian Hebraist. In his most famous work, the _Pugio Fidei_ or _Dagger of Faith_, written around 1280, he made abundant use of Jewish post-biblical literature in order to prove his claim that the Messiah had already come. Thus, he drew heavily on the Talmud and the Midrashim, which are quoted both in the Hebrew original as well as in Latin translation. The Library of the Katz Center owns the _editio princeps_ of this seminal work, published by Joseph De Voisin in 1651 in Paris.\n\n### The Pentateuch Commentary of Moses Nahmanides\n\nMordechai Z. Cohen\n\n \n![cohennahmanide001900@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/cohennahmanide001900%402x.jpg)\n![img_2.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/img_2.png)\n\nDisplayed here are two pages from the Pentateuch commentary of Moses Nahmanides (1194-1270), the great Catalan exegete, talmudist, and kabbalist. As reflected in this commentary, Nahmanides stood at an intellectual crossroads of multiple interpretive traditions that he inherited in partial and refracted ways. On the one hand, he was heir to the Geonic-Andalusian school, which migrated into Christian Spain as the _Reconquista_ progressed. Although Nahmanides evidently did not read Arabic, he avidly absorbed a mediated version of Geonic and Andalusian learning in the Hebrew writings of Abraham Ibn Ezra and David Kimhi, as well as the recently composed Hebrew translations - by Judah and Samuel Ibn Tibbon and Judah Alharizi - of works by Saadia, Ibn Janah and Maimonides. At the same time, Nahmanides was influenced by the momentous innovations in talmudic learning in twelfth-century northern France, which was accompanied by a deep respect for Rashi and his Bible commentaries. On the other hand, Nahmanides largely ignores - or perhaps was unaware of - the refined _peshat_ commentaries of Rashi's students, the great _pashtanim_ Joseph Qara and Rashbam.\n\nThere is a distinctive theological strain in Nahmanides' Pentateuch commentary. He incorporates - but at times engaged in - a polemic with the philosophical interpretive mode of Moses Maimonides, as expressed in the latter's _Guide of the Perplexed_. As a counterbalance to Maimonides' rationalistic outlook, Nahmanides often presents a kabbalistic reading of the biblical text, finding within it deep mystical meanings. He avers, for example, that the entire Pentateuch can be read as a secret amalgam of divine names, in addition to its reading \"according to the commandments\" i.e., in its literal sense as the Law. It is the literal sense, or _peshat_, that leads Nahmanides to note structural and other literary features of the Pentateuch. The two pages displayed here are from his introductory remarks to Numbers and Deuteronomy, in which he endeavors to identify the distinctive themes of these two books of the Pentateuch - as he does for Genesis, Exodus and Leviticus - thereby providing a rationale for its five-part literary organization.\n\nAlthough he his one among many Jewish authors over the centuries who have interpreted the Bible, Nahmanides' multi-dimensional Pentateuch commentary is considered among the most profound, and is avidly studied to this day.\n\n### Becoming Tosafot\n\nRami Reiner\n\n![reiner001900@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/reiner001900%402x.jpg)\n![img_4.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/img_4.png)\n\nThe copy of _Tractate Bekhorot_ included in this exhibition is one of the volumes of the first complete edition of the Talmud, printed in the printing house of Daniel Bomberg in Venice between 1520 and 1523. Bomberg's edition had a huge impact on the use and study of the Talmud. The page layout introduced in the Venice printing has been preserved in virtually every subsequent printing of the Talmud, including the famous Vilna edition and the recent Schottenstein edition. This is no accident. The advent of printing changed the way in which citations to the Talmud are given. During the manuscript era, scholars would refer to a specific Talmudic discussion by its name and the name of the chapter in which it appeared. After the printed editions took hold, it became possible to give a much more precise reference to the page within the tractate on which the source appeared. The popularity and wide distribution of the Bomberg edition led its page numbers to become the universal standard.\n\nThe significance of the Venice printing is not only in the text of the Talmud, but also in what it added to the Talmud which would with time become an integral part of the text—Rashi's commentary, printed on the inner margin of every page, and the comments of the Tosafot, French sages from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, on the outer margin. One can hardly overstate the role played by the Venice Talmud, which combined these elements on a single page, in creating the form of study known as GaPaT—Gemara (Talmud), Rashi and Tosafot. GaPaT became the classic form of Talmud study for centuries, to this very day. The innovation of having the commentaries of Rashi and Tosafot on the same page as the Talmud meant that one need not open more than one book at a time to study the Talmud. This led to a decline in the use of manuscript versions of Tosafot commentaries, and far fewer such manuscripts have survived to the present day than medieval manuscripts in other genres. The ease of studying a printed, glossed text overpowered the conservative urge to preserve old study habits and old books, and led to the disappearance of other Tosafot collections.\n\nFinally, the layout of the printed page of the Talmud could be considered a further chapter in a thread of Jewish history which began with the Mishnah edited by Rabbi Judah the Patriarch in the Galilee in the third century, and continued with the Talmud itself which was created in Babylonia from the third to the fifth centuries. Rashi's commentaries were written in the eleventh century in the Franco-Ashkenazic cultural sphere, since Rashi himelf was born in France and educated in the academies of Germany. The Tosafot were written in that same area, principally during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Thus, the printed Talmud page brings together multiple generations of the Jewish people who in all their wanderings continued to devote themselves to the study of Talmud.\n\n### Notarial Relations\n\nRebecca Winer and Sol Cohen\n![cohenwiner-comp.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/cohenwiner-comp.jpg)\n \nDuring the thirteenth century in the Latin Mediterranean, notaries were required to register all of the documents they drafted for their clients in a protocol that they kept for future reference. Currently in France, the medieval town of Perpignan was under the political control of the rulers of the Crown of Aragon (Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearics, Montpellier et al.). The thirteenth-century Crown of Aragon housed many prosperous and intellectually vibrant Jewish communities. The major Jewish urban center of Perpignan produced the highly original thinker Menahem ha-Meiri (who appears in Latin in the protocols of the 1270s on as Vidal Salamó Meir).\n\nThis image focuses on one of a series of radically abbreviated transactions in Latin: a loan that Bonafonat \"Capellanus,\" or \"the chaplain,\" made on 24 August 1261 to the Jew Mosse de Soal of twenty-two diners (pennies) to be repaid on the feast of the Archangel Michael, or Michaelmas, 29 September. This was a small loan made for a short time, only a month. Perhaps it concerned payment for Capellanus's services as a Latin scribe; it is not possible to be certain. The 1261 protocol is one of only two registers with Hebrew notations; brief annotations appear after eight Latin transactions in 1261 and an additional two in a 1266 register.\n\nThe bottom right of this loan displays Mosse de Soal's name in Hebrew: משה ד שואל. His Christian creditor may have asked Mosse to sign to support the transaction. Jews who lent money had been ordered by the king to take public oaths registered with their local notaries since 1241 at the latest. From the 1270s Hebrew notations are not found within the Latin registers. This 1261 register can thus possibly be read as transitional; a stage in the increasing familiarity and reliance of Jews on local Latin notarial culture. Local Jews regularly drafted Hebrew shetarot throughout the thirteenth century and well beyond. They also made transactions in Latin, not only debts and loans with Christians, but many other types of Jewish/ Christian transactions alongside various Latin agreements between Jews including those supporting Hebrew marriage contracts and death-bed inheritance declarations.\n\n### The Revival of Ciceronian Rhetoric\n\nRita Copeland\n\n![copeland1629-1r900r@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/copeland1629-1r900r%402x.jpg)\n![copel2and1630-80v900@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/copel2and1630-80v900%402x.jpg)\n \nDuring 2012-13, the University of Pennsylvania Rare Book Collection acquired two important medieval manuscripts that show the revival of Ciceronian rhetorical study in the later Middle Ages.\n\n**Ms. Codex 1629 - Commentaria ad Rhetoricam Ciceronis**\n\nThe author of this commentary is unknown, although it is likely that he was a Dominican. The interest of the commentary lies in its position at the beginning of new commentative interest in the Ciceronian rhetorics after the dry years of the thirteenth century. While Cicero's own youthful work, the De inventione, was much read during the early and central Middle Ages, the Rhetorica ad Herennium only really came into its own as a theoretical resource after about 1100, and from the second half of the twelfth century overshadowed the De inventione. But neither text received much new attention during the thirteenth century, because the study of eloquence was not part of the curriculum of university arts faculties. This does not mean that ancient rhetoric was not studied, but rather that most of the advanced academic contexts did not promote new commentaries on the older texts. The Ciceronian rhetorics remained relevant to the study of _dictamen_ (the art of letter writing), but this field encouraged the production of new, practical textbooks rather than commentaries on the ancient texts. However, from the fourteenth century onwards, the religious orders, especially the Benedictines in Oxford and the mendicant _studia_ in Italy, began to show great interest in Ciceronian rhetoric, and here the Ad Herennium was considered more useful perhaps because it is a complete course on the art. The Plena et perfecta commentary illustrates the course of study in mendicant circles and the expansion of rhetorical thought because of its application to preaching, business and bureaucratic needs, and arguing against heresy.\n\nThere is no edition of this commentary, which survives only in four manuscripts (two manuscripts in Italian archives, one held in the Bodleian Library, and one now held at the University of Pennsylvania).\n\nThe Plena et perfecta commentary gives us a clear picture of medieval glossing practices and education. It is a complete, free-standing commentary on the text, thus embodying the importance of that practice; and it is a working text, its annotations showing how rhetorical teaching was put to use for pragmatic purposes. The manuscript illustrates the practical value of rhetorical teaching outside the universities.\n\nPenn's Rare Book and Manuscript collection also acquired a complete copy of the Rhetorica ad Herennium itself, from fifteenth-century Italy: **Ms. Codex 1630 - Rhetorica ad Herennium.**\n\nThis manuscript gives a superb vista into late-medieval/early humanist practical uses of the Ad Herennium. As noted above, the Ad Herennium had begun to supersede the De inventione in popularity by the end of the twelfth century, and in this mid-fifteenth-century copy we can see some reasons for this shift: the Ad Herennium is a complete rhetoric, it teaches things that people needed to know, it has sections on memory and delivery and style as well as technical precepts for invention. All of these \"value-added features\" are brought together in a small, elegant but inexpensive, and convenient form in the fifteenth-century copy.\n\nThis Ad Herennium manuscript also offers a nice complement to the Plena et perfecta commentary. The Plena et perfecta is a Dominican product, an aid to learning the classical text for the purposes of preaching and even arguing against heresy (a special job of the Dominicans). The fifteenth-century Ad Herennium text, by contrast, is a portable book, probably designed for handy reference by either a preacher or some other kind of public speaker. It is the kind of object that could have been as valuable for a political speaker as for a religious preacher. Thus in these two manuscripts we have contrasting uses for the same material: close study of a lemmatic commentary in a volume that was not obviously designed to be portable; and the Ciceronian text itself in a portable form, without glossing but with handy rubrication for easy reference.\n\n### Commentaries on the Scientific and Philosophical Texts of Aristotle\n\nS.J. Pearce\n\n![pearce-ljs453-15r900@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/pearce-ljs453-15r900%402x.jpg)\n\nThis substantial codex, copied in Germany in 1446 and consisting of 269 folios written in several Ashkenazi scribal hands, was recently acquired by the University of Pennsylvania through a gift made by the noted collector Lawrence J. Schoenberg and Barbra Brizdle Schoenberg. LJS 453 contains Hebrew translations of Arabic commentaries on the scientific works of Aristotle. Although it represents a fifteenth-century copy of the commentaries on works on various aspects of natural history, as well as on cosmology and meteorology, the texts themselves are the product of developments in intellectual history and tastes that flourished in earnest in the thirteenth century and continued into the fourteenth. As early as the second half of the twelfth century, Jewish readers living in regions of what are modern-day Spain and France began to translate Arabic-language scientific, philosophical and religious texts into Hebrew, with the consequence that these texts became available to a wider readership. The beginnings of this translation movement, which was consciously modeled on the ninth-century movement in the eastern Mediterranean to translate Greek-language texts into Syriac and Arabic, also led to the creation of a brand new technical vocabulary in Hebrew, since translators were often required to coin new terms for concepts in these fields that had not previously ever been discussed or written about in Hebrew.\n\nThe texts in this volume include: Solomon ibn Ayyub's translation of Averroes' commentary on De Caelo; translations by the noted Hebrew poet Kalonymos ben Kalonymos of the commentary on De generatione et corruptione and the Meteorologia; and Jacob ben Makhir's translation of De Animalibus. The volume also contains Hebrew translations of Abraham ibn Ezra's commentary on Psalms and fragments of Moses Maimonides' Epistle to the Yemen. Taken together, these texts offer a coherent and complete, if not comprehensive, overview of the major intellectual and religious trends and debates that were current in thirteenth-century Spain and France. Beginning in the second half of the twelfth century, the father-and-son pair of translators, Judah and Samuel ibn Tibbon, began to adapt Arabic texts into Hebrew, often times at the request of particular communities with low levels of Arabic literacy but interest in reading texts of classical antiquity and the medieval Arabic commentaries upon them; this trend continued in northern Spain and southern France and allowed for the wide dissemination in the Jewish world of texts that were of scientific and dialectical-rationalist character.\n\n### If You Find an Engraved Stone: The Transmission of Science and Magic\n\nKatelyn Mesler\n\n![mesler149@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/mesler149%402x.jpg)\n \nAmong the scientific writings of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages are treatises known as Lapidaries, short encyclopedic works on the properties of stones and minerals. One type of lapidary, exemplified by Marbode of Rennes's famous Latin work _On Stones_, listed the name of each stone (often alphabetically), followed by details such as their color, where they are found, and any special \"virtues\" or powers that the stone possesses (such as the loadstone's power of attraction or the bezoar's reputation as an antidote for poison). Another type of lapidary was concerned with the symbolic meaning of the twelve biblical stones of the high priest's breastplate and the heavenly Jerusalem.\n\n_The Techel/Azareus Complex_, pictured here, is a Latin lapidary in which engravings of astrological symbols are said to imbue the stones with powers. The prologue (in red) offers an origin story for the text and the stones it describes: \"In the name of the Lord, Amen. This is Cheel's great, precious, and secret little book of the sigils that the children of Israel made in the desert after their departure from Egypt, in accordance with the motion and course of the planets and constellations.\" Entries for the stones begin with the phrase \"If you find...\" and then describe in detail the images, based largely on Greco-Roman astrological iconography, that one might find engraved on a stone. The reader is then instructed on the special virtues and magical uses of any stone that meets the description.\n\nThe origins of the _Techel/Azareus Complex_ remain a mystery, but the text has roots and parallels in the Greek and Arabic lapidary traditions. The oldest identified copy of this Latin lapidary dates to the twelfth century. In the course of the next few centuries, it was translated into several vernacular languages and became one of the most widely circulated and cited of all medieval lapidaries. Notably, the text was also translated into Hebrew (via Anglo-Norman) in the thirteenth century. By the end of the Middle Ages, two more Jewish versions had appeared: one written in Italian in Hebrew characters and a second Hebrew version (via Castilian and Catalan) that may have originated outside the Latin tradition. The lapidary in all its versions is part of a wider movement in the Middle Ages to transmit and translate scientific works, bridging not only ancient and medieval traditions but also cultural, linguistic, and religious ones.\n\n### The _'Amude Golah_  (_Pillars of Exile_) of R. Isaac of Corbeil\n\nJudah Galinsky\n\n![galinskySeMaK900@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/galinskySeMaK900%402x.jpg)\n\nThe _'Amude Golah_ (_Pillars of Exile_) of R. Isaac of Corbeil was completed circa 1278 just a few years prior to the author's death in the spring of 1280. This accessible halakhic work, written with the intent of reaching a broad reading audience, was extremely popular during the later Middle Ages as the numerous extant manuscripts can attest (close to 200 mss.). With time the work became known as the Sefer Mitsvot Katan \\\\\\[The Short Book of Commandments\\\\\\] or Semak. Shortly following its distribution the author's younger contemporary and even more famous townsman, R. Peretz of Corbeil, appended his scholarly glosses to the Semak. Almost all surviving manuscripts of the work include these learned glosses.\n\nOne of the most difficult textual problems that one encounters in studying Isaac of Corbeil's work relates to Peretz's glosses. Copyists of the work from the 13th century onwards had great difficulty in differentiating between Isaac's original work and the later material added by Peretz. This led to situations where Peretz comments were frequently integrated into the body of the work while at times Isaacs' thoughts were relegated to the glosses. The task of reconstructing Isaac's original work became feasible only with the discovery of the version found in British Library Add. 11639 (1056 in Margoliouth Catalogue) known as the Northern French Hebrew Miscellany (reproduced here from the Falter Facsimile Editions).\n\nThis late thirteenth-century manuscript was copied by a certain Benjamin the Scribe. The colophon lacks an exact date however Malachi Beit-Arie has argued, based on internal calendar evidence, that the 746 page manuscript was copied during the years 1279 –1282\\\\. I would add that in his copy of the Semak, Benjamin constantly refers to R. Isaac of Corbeil with the abbreviation _\"mem reish shin\" moreinu shechye_—my master may he live \\\\\\[a long life\\\\\\]. This would indicate that at the time that Benjamin transcribed the book, Isaac was still alive. Since Isaac died in the spring of the year 1280 this would further strengthen Beit-Arieh's dating for the copying of the entire manuscript. It is true that not always does the \"earliest\" surviving manuscript turn out to be significant; however in this case it does. To the best of my knowledge this is the only version of the Semak to reach us that does not include any of Peretz's glosses. It is reasonable to assume that at the time the work was copied Peretz had not yet written his glosses, and definitely had not circulated them. Thus any attempt to reconstruct Isaac of Corbeil's original Semak would have to begin with this unique manuscript.\n\n### An Interfaith Dialogue of Flaming Arrows: Johan Christoph Wagenseil and his Tela Ignea Satanae\n\nPiero Capelli\n\n![capelli1200@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/capelli1200%402x.jpg)\n\nJohann Christoph Wagenseil (b. Nuremberg, 1633; d. Altdorf, 1705) earned his Dr.Phil. in 1665 from Altdorf Academy, the forerunner of the University of Altdorf, and taught history, law and Near Eastern languages from 1668 until the end of his life. His book Tela Ignea Satanae (The Flaming Arrows of Satan, Altdorf, 1681), from which the portrait is taken, is an anthology of Jewish anti-Christian polemics containing many of the most important medieval and early modern Jewish anti-Christian polemics: the Toledot Yeshu, the Hebrew accounts of the 13th century Paris Talmud trial and the Barcelona disputation, the Sefer Nizzahon Yashan, and Isaac Troki's Hizzuq Emunah. These appeared here in their first printed editions, with Latin translations and scholarly commentary Wagenseil's historical and philological awareness in the book are acute and prescient; but it was openly inspired by pointed anti-Jewish intent, as is evident from its title, in which the \"flaming arrows of Satan\" (cf. Ephesians 6:16) are Jewish ones aimed against Christendom.\n\nAfter publishing Tela Ignea Satanae, Wagenseil came into contact with Jewish scholars. This made him aware of the hardships of the status of the Jews in Europe and of the absurdity of the accusations of ritual murder. Toward the end of his life, according to the historian Peter Blastenbrei, Wagenseil \"began to sketch a design for peaceful coexistence of Jews and Christians through legal demarcation, humane treatment of the minority, and closer mutual acquaintance.\" He took a stand against the ritual murder libel in an essay called \"Judæos non Uti Sanguine Christiano\" (\"The Jews Do Not Make Use of Christian Blood\") published in his book Benachrichtigung wegen einiger die gemeine Jüdischheit betreffenden wichtigen Sachen (Information against Some Important Things Concerning the Jewish Community, Leipzig, 1705). At the same time, he remained convinced that the Jews blasphemed against Jesus, Mary and Christian dogmas and symbols (Denunciatio Christiana de Blasphemiis Judæorum in Jesum Christum, A Christian Condemnation of Jewish Blasphemies against Jesus Christ, Altdorf, 1703), and promoted Christian missionizing to the Jews (Hoffnung der Erlösung Israels, Hope in Israel's Redemption, Leipzig, 1705).\n\n### Meir b. Isaac Aldabi's Paths of Faith (_Shevile Emuna_)\n\nUri Shachar\n\n![Shachar-Shevile-emunah001-900@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/Shachar-Shevile-emunah001-900%402x.jpg)\n\nIn 1346 or thereabout Meir Aldabi, a Toledan polymath, immigrated to Jerusalem where he resided until his death fourteen years later. During this final period of his eventful life, Aldabi completed his _magnum opus,_ The Paths of Faith \\\\\\[Shevile Emunah\\\\\\]—a comprehensive 'encyclopedia' which covers many of the major trajectories in late medieval Jewish natural philosophy, theology, and mysticism. Aldabi's work, which is both far reaching and concise, enjoyed immediate and long lasting success. Both individual chapters (especially paths four and five) and the unified work were disseminated widely. The Library at the Katz Center holds a facsimile of the earliest printed edition of this pre-modern best seller, produced at Riva di Trento in 1558.\n\nDespite its popularity among a variety of circles and over the course of several centuries, The Paths of Faith has received scant attention in modern scholarship. Previous generations of intellectual historians saw in this work a clumsy, unoriginal concoction of earlier theoretical or pre-existing encyclopedic material. Closer attention, however, to the ways in which Aldabi put to use the material he reproduced reveals that, in fact, he undertook a unique, herculean effort to harmonize diverse and often contradictory intellectual tendencies that shaped the Jewish contemplative landscape of his times, into one spiritual program. As such, The Paths of Faith does not only list, but in fact, reconciles and hence redefines rationalist, conservative, and mystical energies that had been pulling in different directions.\n\nOne such intellectual impulse that Aldabi accommodates stems from a tradition that he must have encountered while in Jerusalem. The tenth and ultimate chapter of the book, about the Redemption, features a processed version of a homily that was penned by an anonymous scholar who immigrated to Acre in the beginning of the thirteenth century. By invoking a messianic framework, this homily reflects on questions of conquest and possession of the Holy Land, in a way that places it in dialogue with contemporaneous Christian and Muslim holy war literature. What is more, this text became the rhetorical and ideological backbone for a number of such homilies subsequently composed by Jews in the Near East under Frankish and Mamluk rule. The Paths of Faith, therefore, encompasses many important trajectories that became manifest through cultural, intellectual, and linguistic contacts between Jews and their neighbors in the late medieval Mediterranean.\n\n### Las _Cantigas de Santa Maria_: Miraculous Stories of Horror and Conversion\n\nKati Ihnat\n\n![ihnat4-900@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/ihnat4-900%402x.jpg)\n\nThe Cantigas de Santa Maria is a collection of over four-hundred short accounts of miracles performed by the Virgin Mary interspersed with songs of praise, produced in the court of Alfonso X of Castile (r. 1252-1284). This image is from one of four extant codices of the collection produced in the 1270s and 80s, Escorial MS T.I.1, the 'códice rico,' as it is known by scholars due to its luxurious nature; one of a small number of facsimiles of this stunning manuscript is held by the University of Pennsylvania library. Almost all the poems in medieval Galician are illustrated with a full-page illustration and are also set to music. Intended to establish Alfonso as Mary's royal champion, the volumes constitute an important testament of the cultural vibrancy of the Castilian court, its development of music, literature and art, as well as its engagement with Jewish and Muslim cultures.\n\nThe miracle story shown here nevertheless provides a complicated picture of inter-cultural relations. It begins with a debate between a Jewish al-faquin—a sage or doctor, here shown in an apothecary—and Merlin, the legendary prophet and magician of Arthurian lore. Merlin defends the Virgin birth and the Incarnation, while the Jew firmly denies it. Faced with the Jew's stubborn resistance to his arguments, Merlin finally calls upon the Virgin to perform a miracle in order to show the Jew the error of his ways. Mary complies by having the Jew's son born with his head on backwards. In his horror at the deformed child, the Jewish father wishes to destroy it, but Merlin takes the boy and uses him to convince other Jews of the truth of the Christian message, leading to baptism, as shown in the final scene.\n\nThe curious story reflects the integration of contemporary literary and devotional trends, as popular secular literature was incorporated into a long-standing legendary tradition of depicting Jewish animosity towards the Virgin. Additionally, it suggests knowledge of the public debate organised by James I, King of neighbouring Aragon, between prominent figures from the Jewish and Christian communities in 1263. But rather than encourage such disputations, the story here, like many others in the volume, seems rather to promote the intercessory role of the Virgin in converting Jews to Christianity. The story and the collection in which it is found therefore illustrate how the tremendous growth of the cult of the Virgin Mary helped shape ideas about Jews and Judaism, as well as relations between Jews and Christians, in thirteenth-century Iberia.\n\n### Commentary on Averroes' Middle Commentaries on the _Isagoge_ of Porphyry, the _Categories_ and _De Interpretatione_ of Aristotle\n\nCharles Manekin\n\n![manekinljs229-001r1200@2x.jpg](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/manekinljs229-001r1200%402x.jpg)\n\nIt is hard to overestimate the importance of the first three books of the logical canon known as the Organon—the Isagoge (Introduction) of Porphyry of Tyre, and the Categories and the De Interpretatione of Aristotle—for medieval intellectual life. Already in late antiquity these books were an essential part of the medical curriculum, and all medieval physicians, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian, were expected to have mastered their comments. Students of scientific subjects commenced their studies with either these particular books, or at least their subject-matter, e.g., how we categorize the world we experience, what sorts of properties distinguish natural kinds from each other, and how we combine our concepts to form judgments about the world.\n\nThe first three books of the Organon were never translated into Hebrew. Instead, paraphrases of them by the 12th century Muslim philosopher Averroes (Ibn Rushd) were translated from the original Arabic into Hebrew in Naples by Jacob Anatoli in 1232 (together with the next two books of the Organon, the Prior and Posterior Analytics, on syllogistic inference and scientific demonstration, respectively.) Averroes' paraphrases or \"Middle Commentaries\" of the first three works are extant in over eighty Hebrew manuscripts (and likely more), making them, according to the great literary historian and bibliographer, Moritz Steinschneider, the most popular works in Hebrew written by a non-Jew. They were commented upon by Jewish savants such as Levi Gersonides in the fourteenth century, and Judah Messer Leon in the fifteenth century.\n\nThe particular commentary found in the Schoenberg Collection (LJS 229) is anonymous and has not yet been studied. No other copy of it exists, to my knowledge, but the section on the De Interpretatione is found in Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cod. hebr. 46. The commentator refers often to the logical writings of the 10th century Muslim philosopher, Alfarabi, some of which were translated into Hebrew in the late 12th and early 13th century. He also refers to the Arabic version of Averroes' text. But, most interestingly, he cites and criticizes at least once the interpretation of \"my teacher, R. Levi,\" which a cursory comparison of the manuscripts reveals to be Gersonides. If this is correct, then the author of the commentary in LJS 229 was another member of Gersonides' \"school,\" where students read texts with Gersonides and occasionally wrote their own glosses as comments, as has recently been studied by Prof. Ruth Glasner of Hebrew University. Since Gersonides also refers to the Arabic version of Averroes, this manuscript sheds additional light on the methodology employed by members of Gersonides' circle.\n\nAs interesting as the anonymous commentary is in itself, the physical codex sheds light on the intellectual life of Provence in the second half of the 15th century. One finds the following statement of ownership in Latin: \"Iste liber est meus mestre Benustruc\\\\\\[?\\\\\\] Avidor.\" This individual may be identified with the 15th century ProvenC'al savant, Avigdor Benastruc, who translated into Hebrew around 1490 the anonymous French Romance of Belle Maguelone, and who wrote a manuscript that included works by the Provencal Jewish scholar, Isaac Nathan, the composer of the first Hebrew concordance of the Bible. If that is the case, it shows that as late as the late fifteenth century, if not later, basic works in Aristotelian logic were studied in Provence, and the influence of Gersonides and his students was still very much felt.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Alfonso, Esperanza.** _Islamic Culture Through Jewish Eyes: Al-Andalus from the Tenth to the Twelfth Century._ (London; New York: Routledge, 2008).\n    \n*   **Alfonso, Esperanza, et al.

Diverse phenomena such as the creation of new philosophic and scientific cultures, the emergence of medieval halakhah (Jewish legal praxis), the diffusion of Kabbalah, the establishment of new mendicant orders, the institutionalization of Sufi brotherhoods, the rise of universities, and the role of inquisitors were studied, not only as isolated phenomena but in their mutual interrelations. In this on-line exhibition we highlight a number of original sources that were draw upon by these scholars in the course of their research: Hebrew, Latin and Arabic manuscripts and early printed texts which illustrate a range of topics such as medieval liturgical poetry, law, rhetoric, philosophy, science, magic, social history, gender relations, inter-communal contact, conflict and other forms of entanglement both positive and negative.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Exhibition cover design adapted from a decorative incipit and illuminated motifs found in a 13th-century Latin translation of an Arabic medical treatise by a 9th/10th-century Jewish physician (Isaac Israeli/Abu Ya’qub Ishaq ibn Suleiman al-Isra’ili)) to the Fatimid Caliph Ubaid Allah al-Mahdi (909-34) in Qairawan (found in present-day Tunisia). The original codex, a miscellany of the fundamental medical textbooks of thirteenth-century Paris, is found in the Lawrence J.

It was copied during the fourteenth century, probably in the Rhineland area of southern Germany and northern Italy. It contains the liturgical poetry (_piyyutim_) recited in the synagogue on both days of \u003Cem>Rosh ha-shanah\u003C/em>, on Yom Kippur, on the first and second day of \u003Cem>Sukkot\u003C/em>, the intermediate Sabbath during \u003Cem>Sukkot\u003C/em> and on \u003Cem>Shemini Atseret\u003C/em>, but it lacks most of the standard prayers said on these occasions because the precentor would have known these by heart. Today, the volume is incomplete, beginning with \u003Cem>musaf\u003C/em> (the additional prayers) recited on the first day of \u003Cem>Rosh ha-shanah\u003C/em> and ending with \u003Cem>musaf\u003C/em> on \u003Cem>Shemini Atseret.\u003C/em> In its complete form it would have contained more than 280 folio leaves (rather than the extant 252 folios). In addition to at least two quires missing at the beginning and one quire missing at the end, several pages have been cut out of the manuscript. The manuscript was rebound in (early) modern times and apparently after that was damaged, probably by fire.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, several changes took place in the production of liturgical manuscripts in Ashkenaz that influenced both the selection of texts and the appearance of the texts on the page. Notwithstanding unifying tendencies, many communities retained their local traditions about which piyyutim to say when, as mirrored by the unusual ordering of \u003Cem>yotsrot\u003C/em> for \u003Cem>Sukkot\u003C/em> in the Katz Center’s \u003Cem>mahzor\u003C/em>. Most textual changes that spread throughout many communities pertain to the omission of \u003Cem>piyyutim\u003C/em>, e.g. many communities decided to abbreviate the recitation of \u003Cem>qedushta’ot,\u003C/em> the complex compositions adorning the \u003Cem>Amidah\u003C/em> on Sabbaths and holidays, by skipping parts of the \u003Cem>rehitim,\u003C/em> the series of highly structured poems in the penultimate position of the \u003Cem>qedushta,\u003C/em> especially on the high holidays when many \u003Cem>piyyutim\u003C/em> were recited. The \u003Cem>mahzor\u003C/em> of the Katz Center displays a selection that is largely in accordance with later habits, although in one case a \u003Cem>piyyut\u003C/em> that had been omitted by the original scribe was added on the margins by an almost contemporary hand (f. 143r). This note was preserved when the margins were cut at a later time, suggesting that the community using the \u003Cem>mahzor\u003C/em> continued to recite this \u003Cem>piyyut\u003C/em>. Interestingly, the \u003Cem>mahzor\u003C/em> does not share another textual change of the late thirteenth, early fourteenth century, namely the omission of the strings of verses inserted into the first three \u003Cem>piyyutim\u003C/em> of \u003Cem>qedushta’ot,\u003C/em> although it rarely contains more than three or four verses, even though earlier manuscripts may have up to seven or eight verses in each string.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Among the \u003Cem>piyyutim\u003C/em> retained by the original scribe were two anti-Christian piyyutim in the \u003Cem>rehitim\u003C/em> for \u003Cem>shaharit\u003C/em> on Yom Kippur that would have appealed to the Jewish communities in Ashkenaz in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries who could use the liturgy to express their antagonism to Christianity in times of growing tension, but apparently these \u003Cem>piyyutim\u003C/em> were considered to be superfluous or even dangerous at a later time, when the leafs containing this \u003Cem>piyyutim\u003C/em> were cut from the \u003Cem>mahzor\u003C/em> (f. 105 and 108). Only one occasion of the \u003Cem>Aleynu\u003C/em> is censored (by erasure) while another occasion of the same text was not changed. It is not possible to reconstruct when this drastic measure was taken, nor whether it is a case of self-censure or due only to outside pressure. Cutting out the \u003Cem>piyyutim\u003C/em> was eased by the selective recitation of \u003Cem>rehitim\u003C/em> that began in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and had led to the omission of some \u003Cem>rehitim\u003C/em> from the manuscript.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The aesthetic changes in the visual appearance of liturgical manuscripts in Ashkenaz developed during the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. Changes in parchment manufacturing brought about a more generous layout with lavish margins, ample space between the lines, sumptuous initial words and—by the end of the thirteenth century—intricate visualizations of poetic structures like acrostics, stanzas, hemistichs and recurring elements. The Katz Center’s \u003Cem>mahzor\u003C/em> displays most of these, although the margins were cut by approximately 1.8 inches on one side, probably by a little less on the other sides, when the volume was rebound in (early) modern times, changing the appearance of the page dramatically, even though the layout is still generous. Some liturgical manuscripts from the fourteenth century use color to mark structure in poetic texts, e.g. for acrostics or biblical verses at the end of stanzas. The \u003Cem>mahzor\u003C/em> of the Katz Center uses black ink only, with the exception of some dots around the letters of initial words in the \u003Cem>Hosha’anot\u003C/em> section and the same red ink in the decoration of the beginning of this section. The scribe took however great care to create well-structured and diversified pages with marked acrostics and poetic structures, using larger letters and short lines, sometimes creating the impression of columns of text. He enlarged the initial words of all \u003Cem>piyyutim\u003C/em> and created major word initials for the complex compositions. The tradition to pay special attention to the beginning pages of \u003Cem>yotsrot\u003C/em> is attested in Ashkenazic mahzorim since the early thirteenth century, and it seems to have guided the scribe of this \u003Cem>mahzor\u003C/em>: The initial word of the \u003Cem>yotser\u003C/em> for the second day of Rosh ha-shanah is framed in a decorated panel, the initial word of the \u003Cem>kol nidre\u003C/em> is gilded.

The geographic diversity of Isaac’s teachers, which renewed a trend that dated from the mid-twelfth century in Ashkenazic lands but had become attenuated for a period of about forty years (c. 1175-1215), gave Isaac access to both the German and north French centers of Tosafist endeavors, and to a rich array of their writings in the fields of talmudic commentary and Jewish law.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not surprisingly, Isaac’s \u003Cem>magnum opus,\u003C/em> Sefer Or Zaru’a, is a large and discursive work that covers a wide range of legal topics.

The story was retold in prose and verse, in Latin and a variety of medieval vernaculars, including Yiddish, and Christian and Jewish biblical commentators used it to make a variety of points, only some of which related to the nature of male friendship.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In a magnificent thirteenth-century book of Bible illustrations mostly contained in Morgan Library MS 638, folio 28 verso, we find this illustration of 1 Samuel 17 and 18.

This anonymous work is considered a classical exposition of the Kabbalistic world cycles doctrine (Hebrew: \u003Cem>Torat ha-Shemitot\u003C/em>). Gershom Scholem, in his groundbreaking studies on the origins of the Kabbalah, considered this text to be a product of the Gerona circle, the earliest Kabbalistic circle in Spain, whose activities are traced to the first half of the thirteenth century. Late in his life Scholem acknowledged that his conclusions about the date and the historical circumstances of \u003Cem>Sefer ha-Temunah\u003C/em> are unsustainable. Subsequent studies carried by Efraim Gottlieb and especially by Moshe Idel suggested that \u003Cem>Sefer ha-Temunah\u003C/em> was written well into the Fourteenth century by a Kabbalist who most probably lived outside Spain. The reassessment concerning of the time and the place of \u003Cem>Sefer ha-Temunah\u003C/em> open the door for a new understanding regarding the development of the world cycles doctrine in early Kabbalah. Rather than emerging suddenly, it seems now that the world cycles doctrine was developing gradually, from its concise formulations in writings of the Gerona circle of Kabbalists of the first half of the thirteenth century, to the elaborate expositions of works such as \u003Cem>Ma’arekhet ha-Elohut\u003C/em> (_The Divine System_) and \u003Cem>Sefer ha-Temunah,\u003C/em> about a century later.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-reception-of-raymond-martís-pugio-fidei-in-the-thirteenth-and-fourteenth-centuries\">The reception of Raymond Martí’s \u003Cem>Pugio fidei\u003C/em> in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Alexander Fidora\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/img_3.png\" alt=\"img_3.png\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/fidora900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"fidora900@2x.jpg\">\nThe Catalan Dominican Ramon Martí is generally considered to be the first Christian Hebraist.

As reflected in this commentary, Nahmanides stood at an intellectual crossroads of multiple interpretive traditions that he inherited in partial and refracted ways. On the one hand, he was heir to the Geonic-Andalusian school, which migrated into Christian Spain as the \u003Cem>Reconquista\u003C/em> progressed. Although Nahmanides evidently did not read Arabic, he avidly absorbed a mediated version of Geonic and Andalusian learning in the Hebrew writings of Abraham Ibn Ezra and David Kimhi, as well as the recently composed Hebrew translations - by Judah and Samuel Ibn Tibbon and Judah Alharizi - of works by Saadia, Ibn Janah and Maimonides. At the same time, Nahmanides was influenced by the momentous innovations in talmudic learning in twelfth-century northern France, which was accompanied by a deep respect for Rashi and his Bible commentaries. On the other hand, Nahmanides largely ignores - or perhaps was unaware of - the refined \u003Cem>peshat\u003C/em> commentaries of Rashi’s students, the great \u003Cem>pashtanim\u003C/em> Joseph Qara and Rashbam.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is a distinctive theological strain in Nahmanides’ Pentateuch commentary. He incorporates - but at times engaged in - a polemic with the philosophical interpretive mode of Moses Maimonides, as expressed in the latter’s \u003Cem>Guide of the Perplexed\u003C/em>. As a counterbalance to Maimonides’ rationalistic outlook, Nahmanides often presents a kabbalistic reading of the biblical text, finding within it deep mystical meanings. He avers, for example, that the entire Pentateuch can be read as a secret amalgam of divine names, in addition to its reading “according to the commandments” i.e., in its literal sense as the Law. It is the literal sense, or \u003Cem>peshat\u003C/em>, that leads Nahmanides to note structural and other literary features of the Pentateuch. The two pages displayed here are from his introductory remarks to Numbers and Deuteronomy, in which he endeavors to identify the distinctive themes of these two books of the Pentateuch - as he does for Genesis, Exodus and Leviticus - thereby providing a rationale for its five-part literary organization.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although he his one among many Jewish authors over the centuries who have interpreted the Bible, Nahmanides’ multi-dimensional Pentateuch commentary is considered among the most profound, and is avidly studied to this day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"becoming-tosafot\">Becoming Tosafot\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Rami Reiner\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/reiner001900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"reiner001900@2x.jpg\">\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/img_4.png\" alt=\"img_4.png\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The copy of \u003Cem>Tractate Bekhorot\u003C/em> included in this exhibition is one of the volumes of the first complete edition of the Talmud, printed in the printing house of Daniel Bomberg in Venice between 1520 and 1523. Bomberg’s edition had a huge impact on the use and study of the Talmud. The page layout introduced in the Venice printing has been preserved in virtually every subsequent printing of the Talmud, including the famous Vilna edition and the recent Schottenstein edition. This is no accident. The advent of printing changed the way in which citations to the Talmud are given. During the manuscript era, scholars would refer to a specific Talmudic discussion by its name and the name of the chapter in which it appeared. After the printed editions took hold, it became possible to give a much more precise reference to the page within the tractate on which the source appeared. The popularity and wide distribution of the Bomberg edition led its page numbers to become the universal standard.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The significance of the Venice printing is not only in the text of the Talmud, but also in what it added to the Talmud which would with time become an integral part of the text—Rashi’s commentary, printed on the inner margin of every page, and the comments of the Tosafot, French sages from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, on the outer margin. One can hardly overstate the role played by the Venice Talmud, which combined these elements on a single page, in creating the form of study known as GaPaT—Gemara (Talmud), Rashi and Tosafot. GaPaT became the classic form of Talmud study for centuries, to this very day. The innovation of having the commentaries of Rashi and Tosafot on the same page as the Talmud meant that one need not open more than one book at a time to study the Talmud. This led to a decline in the use of manuscript versions of Tosafot commentaries, and far fewer such manuscripts have survived to the present day than medieval manuscripts in other genres. The ease of studying a printed, glossed text overpowered the conservative urge to preserve old study habits and old books, and led to the disappearance of other Tosafot collections.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Finally, the layout of the printed page of the Talmud could be considered a further chapter in a thread of Jewish history which began with the Mishnah edited by Rabbi Judah the Patriarch in the Galilee in the third century, and continued with the Talmud itself which was created in Babylonia from the third to the fifth centuries. Rashi’s commentaries were written in the eleventh century in the Franco-Ashkenazic cultural sphere, since Rashi himelf was born in France and educated in the academies of Germany. The Tosafot were written in that same area, principally during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Thus, the printed Talmud page brings together multiple generations of the Jewish people who in all their wanderings continued to devote themselves to the study of Talmud.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"notarial-relations\">Notarial Relations\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Rebecca Winer and Sol Cohen\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/cohenwiner-comp.jpg\" alt=\"cohenwiner-comp.jpg\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>During the thirteenth century in the Latin Mediterranean, notaries were required to register all of the documents they drafted for their clients in a protocol that they kept for future reference. Currently in France, the medieval town of Perpignan was under the political control of the rulers of the Crown of Aragon (Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearics, Montpellier et al.). The thirteenth-century Crown of Aragon housed many prosperous and intellectually vibrant Jewish communities. The major Jewish urban center of Perpignan produced the highly original thinker Menahem ha-Meiri (who appears in Latin in the protocols of the 1270s on as Vidal Salamó Meir).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This image focuses on one of a series of radically abbreviated transactions in Latin: a loan that Bonafonat “Capellanus,” or “the chaplain,” made on 24 August 1261 to the Jew Mosse de Soal of twenty-two diners (pennies) to be repaid on the feast of the Archangel Michael, or Michaelmas, 29 September. This was a small loan made for a short time, only a month. Perhaps it concerned payment for Capellanus’s services as a Latin scribe; it is not possible to be certain. The 1261 protocol is one of only two registers with Hebrew notations; brief annotations appear after eight Latin transactions in 1261 and an additional two in a 1266 register.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The bottom right of this loan displays Mosse de Soal’s name in Hebrew: משה ד שואל. His Christian creditor may have asked Mosse to sign to support the transaction. Jews who lent money had been ordered by the king to take public oaths registered with their local notaries since 1241 at the latest. From the 1270s Hebrew notations are not found within the Latin registers. This 1261 register can thus possibly be read as transitional; a stage in the increasing familiarity and reliance of Jews on local Latin notarial culture. Local Jews regularly drafted Hebrew shetarot throughout the thirteenth century and well beyond. They also made transactions in Latin, not only debts and loans with Christians, but many other types of Jewish/ Christian transactions alongside various Latin agreements between Jews including those supporting Hebrew marriage contracts and death-bed inheritance declarations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-revival-of-ciceronian-rhetoric\">The Revival of Ciceronian Rhetoric\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Rita Copeland\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/copeland1629-1r900r%402x.jpg\" alt=\"copeland1629-1r900r@2x.jpg\">\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/copel2and1630-80v900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"copel2and1630-80v900@2x.jpg\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>During 2012-13, the University of Pennsylvania Rare Book Collection acquired two important medieval manuscripts that show the revival of Ciceronian rhetorical study in the later Middle Ages.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Ms. Codex 1629 - Commentaria ad Rhetoricam Ciceronis\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The author of this commentary is unknown, although it is likely that he was a Dominican. The interest of the commentary lies in its position at the beginning of new commentative interest in the Ciceronian rhetorics after the dry years of the thirteenth century. While Cicero’s own youthful work, the De inventione, was much read during the early and central Middle Ages, the Rhetorica ad Herennium only really came into its own as a theoretical resource after about 1100, and from the second half of the twelfth century overshadowed the De inventione. But neither text received much new attention during the thirteenth century, because the study of eloquence was not part of the curriculum of university arts faculties. This does not mean that ancient rhetoric was not studied, but rather that most of the advanced academic contexts did not promote new commentaries on the older texts. The Ciceronian rhetorics remained relevant to the study of \u003Cem>dictamen\u003C/em> (the art of letter writing), but this field encouraged the production of new, practical textbooks rather than commentaries on the ancient texts. However, from the fourteenth century onwards, the religious orders, especially the Benedictines in Oxford and the mendicant \u003Cem>studia\u003C/em> in Italy, began to show great interest in Ciceronian rhetoric, and here the Ad Herennium was considered more useful perhaps because it is a complete course on the art. The Plena et perfecta commentary illustrates the course of study in mendicant circles and the expansion of rhetorical thought because of its application to preaching, business and bureaucratic needs, and arguing against heresy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is no edition of this commentary, which survives only in four manuscripts (two manuscripts in Italian archives, one held in the Bodleian Library, and one now held at the University of Pennsylvania).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Plena et perfecta commentary gives us a clear picture of medieval glossing practices and education. It is a complete, free-standing commentary on the text, thus embodying the importance of that practice; and it is a working text, its annotations showing how rhetorical teaching was put to use for pragmatic purposes. The manuscript illustrates the practical value of rhetorical teaching outside the universities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Penn’s Rare Book and Manuscript collection also acquired a complete copy of the Rhetorica ad Herennium itself, from fifteenth-century Italy: \u003Cstrong>Ms. Codex 1630 - Rhetorica ad Herennium.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This manuscript gives a superb vista into late-medieval/early humanist practical uses of the Ad Herennium. As noted above, the Ad Herennium had begun to supersede the De inventione in popularity by the end of the twelfth century, and in this mid-fifteenth-century copy we can see some reasons for this shift: the Ad Herennium is a complete rhetoric, it teaches things that people needed to know, it has sections on memory and delivery and style as well as technical precepts for invention. All of these “value-added features” are brought together in a small, elegant but inexpensive, and convenient form in the fifteenth-century copy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This Ad Herennium manuscript also offers a nice complement to the Plena et perfecta commentary. The Plena et perfecta is a Dominican product, an aid to learning the classical text for the purposes of preaching and even arguing against heresy (a special job of the Dominicans). The fifteenth-century Ad Herennium text, by contrast, is a portable book, probably designed for handy reference by either a preacher or some other kind of public speaker. It is the kind of object that could have been as valuable for a political speaker as for a religious preacher. Thus in these two manuscripts we have contrasting uses for the same material: close study of a lemmatic commentary in a volume that was not obviously designed to be portable; and the Ciceronian text itself in a portable form, without glossing but with handy rubrication for easy reference.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"commentaries-on-the-scientific-and-philosophical-texts-of-aristotle\">Commentaries on the Scientific and Philosophical Texts of Aristotle\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>S.J.

Schoenberg and Barbra Brizdle Schoenberg. LJS 453 contains Hebrew translations of Arabic commentaries on the scientific works of Aristotle. Although it represents a fifteenth-century copy of the commentaries on works on various aspects of natural history, as well as on cosmology and meteorology, the texts themselves are the product of developments in intellectual history and tastes that flourished in earnest in the thirteenth century and continued into the fourteenth. As early as the second half of the twelfth century, Jewish readers living in regions of what are modern-day Spain and France began to translate Arabic-language scientific, philosophical and religious texts into Hebrew, with the consequence that these texts became available to a wider readership. The beginnings of this translation movement, which was consciously modeled on the ninth-century movement in the eastern Mediterranean to translate Greek-language texts into Syriac and Arabic, also led to the creation of a brand new technical vocabulary in Hebrew, since translators were often required to coin new terms for concepts in these fields that had not previously ever been discussed or written about in Hebrew.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The texts in this volume include: Solomon ibn Ayyub’s translation of Averroes’ commentary on De Caelo; translations by the noted Hebrew poet Kalonymos ben Kalonymos of the commentary on De generatione et corruptione and the Meteorologia; and Jacob ben Makhir’s translation of De Animalibus. The volume also contains Hebrew translations of Abraham ibn Ezra’s commentary on Psalms and fragments of Moses Maimonides’ Epistle to the Yemen. Taken together, these texts offer a coherent and complete, if not comprehensive, overview of the major intellectual and religious trends and debates that were current in thirteenth-century Spain and France. Beginning in the second half of the twelfth century, the father-and-son pair of translators, Judah and Samuel ibn Tibbon, began to adapt Arabic texts into Hebrew, often times at the request of particular communities with low levels of Arabic literacy but interest in reading texts of classical antiquity and the medieval Arabic commentaries upon them; this trend continued in northern Spain and southern France and allowed for the wide dissemination in the Jewish world of texts that were of scientific and dialectical-rationalist character.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"if-you-find-an-engraved-stone-the-transmission-of-science-and-magic\">If You Find an Engraved Stone: The Transmission of Science and Magic\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Katelyn Mesler\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/mesler149%402x.jpg\" alt=\"mesler149@2x.jpg\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Among the scientific writings of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages are treatises known as Lapidaries, short encyclopedic works on the properties of stones and minerals. One type of lapidary, exemplified by Marbode of Rennes’s famous Latin work \u003Cem>On Stones\u003C/em>, listed the name of each stone (often alphabetically), followed by details such as their color, where they are found, and any special “virtues” or powers that the stone possesses (such as the loadstone’s power of attraction or the bezoar’s reputation as an antidote for poison). Another type of lapidary was concerned with the symbolic meaning of the twelve biblical stones of the high priest’s breastplate and the heavenly Jerusalem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>The Techel/Azareus Complex\u003C/em>, pictured here, is a Latin lapidary in which engravings of astrological symbols are said to imbue the stones with powers. The prologue (in red) offers an origin story for the text and the stones it describes: “In the name of the Lord, Amen. This is Cheel’s great, precious, and secret little book of the sigils that the children of Israel made in the desert after their departure from Egypt, in accordance with the motion and course of the planets and constellations.” Entries for the stones begin with the phrase “If you find…” and then describe in detail the images, based largely on Greco-Roman astrological iconography, that one might find engraved on a stone. The reader is then instructed on the special virtues and magical uses of any stone that meets the description.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The origins of the \u003Cem>Techel/Azareus Complex\u003C/em> remain a mystery, but the text has roots and parallels in the Greek and Arabic lapidary traditions. The oldest identified copy of this Latin lapidary dates to the twelfth century. In the course of the next few centuries, it was translated into several vernacular languages and became one of the most widely circulated and cited of all medieval lapidaries. Notably, the text was also translated into Hebrew (via Anglo-Norman) in the thirteenth century. By the end of the Middle Ages, two more Jewish versions had appeared: one written in Italian in Hebrew characters and a second Hebrew version (via Castilian and Catalan) that may have originated outside the Latin tradition. The lapidary in all its versions is part of a wider movement in the Middle Ages to transmit and translate scientific works, bridging not only ancient and medieval traditions but also cultural, linguistic, and religious ones.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-amude-golah--pillars-of-exile-of-r-isaac-of-corbeil\">The \u003Cem>‘Amude Golah\u003C/em>  (\u003Cem>Pillars of Exile\u003C/em>) of R.

This accessible halakhic work, written with the intent of reaching a broad reading audience, was extremely popular during the later Middle Ages as the numerous extant manuscripts can attest (close to 200 mss.). With time the work became known as the Sefer Mitsvot Katan \\[The Short Book of Commandments\\] or Semak. Shortly following its distribution the author’s younger contemporary and even more famous townsman, R. Peretz of Corbeil, appended his scholarly glosses to the Semak. Almost all surviving manuscripts of the work include these learned glosses.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the most difficult textual problems that one encounters in studying Isaac of Corbeil’s work relates to Peretz’s glosses. Copyists of the work from the 13th century onwards had great difficulty in differentiating between Isaac’s original work and the later material added by Peretz. This led to situations where Peretz comments were frequently integrated into the body of the work while at times Isaacs’ thoughts were relegated to the glosses. The task of reconstructing Isaac’s original work became feasible only with the discovery of the version found in British Library Add. 11639 (1056 in Margoliouth Catalogue) known as the Northern French Hebrew Miscellany (reproduced here from the Falter Facsimile Editions).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This late thirteenth-century manuscript was copied by a certain Benjamin the Scribe. The colophon lacks an exact date however Malachi Beit-Arie has argued, based on internal calendar evidence, that the 746 page manuscript was copied during the years 1279 –1282\\. I would add that in his copy of the Semak, Benjamin constantly refers to R. Isaac of Corbeil with the abbreviation \u003Cem>“mem reish shin” moreinu shechye\u003C/em>—my master may he live \\[a long life\\]. This would indicate that at the time that Benjamin transcribed the book, Isaac was still alive. Since Isaac died in the spring of the year 1280 this would further strengthen Beit-Arieh’s dating for the copying of the entire manuscript. It is true that not always does the “earliest” surviving manuscript turn out to be significant; however in this case it does. To the best of my knowledge this is the only version of the Semak to reach us that does not include any of Peretz’s glosses. It is reasonable to assume that at the time the work was copied Peretz had not yet written his glosses, and definitely had not circulated them. Thus any attempt to reconstruct Isaac of Corbeil’s original Semak would have to begin with this unique manuscript.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"an-interfaith-dialogue-of-flaming-arrows-johan-christoph-wagenseil-and-his-tela-ignea-satanae\">An Interfaith Dialogue of Flaming Arrows: Johan Christoph Wagenseil and his Tela Ignea Satanae\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Piero Capelli\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/capelli1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"capelli1200@2x.jpg\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Johann Christoph Wagenseil (b. Nuremberg, 1633; d. Altdorf, 1705) earned his Dr.Phil. in 1665 from Altdorf Academy, the forerunner of the University of Altdorf, and taught history, law and Near Eastern languages from 1668 until the end of his life. His book Tela Ignea Satanae (The Flaming Arrows of Satan, Altdorf, 1681), from which the portrait is taken, is an anthology of Jewish anti-Christian polemics containing many of the most important medieval and early modern Jewish anti-Christian polemics: the Toledot Yeshu, the Hebrew accounts of the 13th century Paris Talmud trial and the Barcelona disputation, the Sefer Nizzahon Yashan, and Isaac Troki’s Hizzuq Emunah. These appeared here in their first printed editions, with Latin translations and scholarly commentary Wagenseil’s historical and philological awareness in the book are acute and prescient; but it was openly inspired by pointed anti-Jewish intent, as is evident from its title, in which the “flaming arrows of Satan” (cf. Ephesians 6:16) are Jewish ones aimed against Christendom.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After publishing Tela Ignea Satanae, Wagenseil came into contact with Jewish scholars. This made him aware of the hardships of the status of the Jews in Europe and of the absurdity of the accusations of ritual murder. Toward the end of his life, according to the historian Peter Blastenbrei, Wagenseil “began to sketch a design for peaceful coexistence of Jews and Christians through legal demarcation, humane treatment of the minority, and closer mutual acquaintance.” He took a stand against the ritual murder libel in an essay called “Judæos non Uti Sanguine Christiano” (“The Jews Do Not Make Use of Christian Blood”) published in his book Benachrichtigung wegen einiger die gemeine Jüdischheit betreffenden wichtigen Sachen (Information against Some Important Things Concerning the Jewish Community, Leipzig, 1705). At the same time, he remained convinced that the Jews blasphemed against Jesus, Mary and Christian dogmas and symbols (Denunciatio Christiana de Blasphemiis Judæorum in Jesum Christum, A Christian Condemnation of Jewish Blasphemies against Jesus Christ, Altdorf, 1703), and promoted Christian missionizing to the Jews (Hoffnung der Erlösung Israels, Hope in Israel’s Redemption, Leipzig, 1705).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"meir-b-isaac-aldabis-paths-of-faith-shevile-emuna\">Meir b.

During this final period of his eventful life, Aldabi completed his \u003Cem>magnum opus,\u003C/em> The Paths of Faith \\[Shevile Emunah\\]—a comprehensive ‘encyclopedia’ which covers many of the major trajectories in late medieval Jewish natural philosophy, theology, and mysticism. Aldabi’s work, which is both far reaching and concise, enjoyed immediate and long lasting success. Both individual chapters (especially paths four and five) and the unified work were disseminated widely. The Library at the Katz Center holds a facsimile of the earliest printed edition of this pre-modern best seller, produced at Riva di Trento in 1558.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Despite its popularity among a variety of circles and over the course of several centuries, The Paths of Faith has received scant attention in modern scholarship. Previous generations of intellectual historians saw in this work a clumsy, unoriginal concoction of earlier theoretical or pre-existing encyclopedic material. Closer attention, however, to the ways in which Aldabi put to use the material he reproduced reveals that, in fact, he undertook a unique, herculean effort to harmonize diverse and often contradictory intellectual tendencies that shaped the Jewish contemplative landscape of his times, into one spiritual program. As such, The Paths of Faith does not only list, but in fact, reconciles and hence redefines rationalist, conservative, and mystical energies that had been pulling in different directions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One such intellectual impulse that Aldabi accommodates stems from a tradition that he must have encountered while in Jerusalem. The tenth and ultimate chapter of the book, about the Redemption, features a processed version of a homily that was penned by an anonymous scholar who immigrated to Acre in the beginning of the thirteenth century. By invoking a messianic framework, this homily reflects on questions of conquest and possession of the Holy Land, in a way that places it in dialogue with contemporaneous Christian and Muslim holy war literature. What is more, this text became the rhetorical and ideological backbone for a number of such homilies subsequently composed by Jews in the Near East under Frankish and Mamluk rule. The Paths of Faith, therefore, encompasses many important trajectories that became manifest through cultural, intellectual, and linguistic contacts between Jews and their neighbors in the late medieval Mediterranean.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"las-cantigas-de-santa-maria-miraculous-stories-of-horror-and-conversion\">Las \u003Cem>Cantigas de Santa Maria\u003C/em>: Miraculous Stories of Horror and Conversion\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Kati Ihnat\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/ihnat4-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"ihnat4-900@2x.jpg\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Cantigas de Santa Maria is a collection of over four-hundred short accounts of miracles performed by the Virgin Mary interspersed with songs of praise, produced in the court of Alfonso X of Castile (r. 1252-1284). This image is from one of four extant codices of the collection produced in the 1270s and 80s, Escorial MS T.I.1, the ‘códice rico,’ as it is known by scholars due to its luxurious nature; one of a small number of facsimiles of this stunning manuscript is held by the University of Pennsylvania library. Almost all the poems in medieval Galician are illustrated with a full-page illustration and are also set to music. Intended to establish Alfonso as Mary’s royal champion, the volumes constitute an important testament of the cultural vibrancy of the Castilian court, its development of music, literature and art, as well as its engagement with Jewish and Muslim cultures.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The miracle story shown here nevertheless provides a complicated picture of inter-cultural relations. It begins with a debate between a Jewish al-faquin—a sage or doctor, here shown in an apothecary—and Merlin, the legendary prophet and magician of Arthurian lore. Merlin defends the Virgin birth and the Incarnation, while the Jew firmly denies it. Faced with the Jew’s stubborn resistance to his arguments, Merlin finally calls upon the Virgin to perform a miracle in order to show the Jew the error of his ways. Mary complies by having the Jew’s son born with his head on backwards. In his horror at the deformed child, the Jewish father wishes to destroy it, but Merlin takes the boy and uses him to convince other Jews of the truth of the Christian message, leading to baptism, as shown in the final scene.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The curious story reflects the integration of contemporary literary and devotional trends, as popular secular literature was incorporated into a long-standing legendary tradition of depicting Jewish animosity towards the Virgin. Additionally, it suggests knowledge of the public debate organised by James I, King of neighbouring Aragon, between prominent figures from the Jewish and Christian communities in 1263. But rather than encourage such disputations, the story here, like many others in the volume, seems rather to promote the intercessory role of the Virgin in converting Jews to Christianity. The story and the collection in which it is found therefore illustrate how the tremendous growth of the cult of the Virgin Mary helped shape ideas about Jews and Judaism, as well as relations between Jews and Christians, in thirteenth-century Iberia.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"commentary-on-averroes-middle-commentaries-on-the-isagoge-of-porphyry-the-categories-and-de-interpretatione-of-aristotle\">Commentary on Averroes’ Middle Commentaries on the \u003Cem>Isagoge\u003C/em> of Porphyry, the \u003Cem>Categories\u003C/em> and \u003Cem>De Interpretatione\u003C/em> of Aristotle\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Charles Manekin\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/13thCentury/manekinljs229-001r1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"manekinljs229-001r1200@2x.jpg\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It is hard to overestimate the importance of the first three books of the logical canon known as the Organon—the Isagoge (Introduction) of Porphyry of Tyre, and the Categories and the De Interpretatione of Aristotle—for medieval intellectual life. Already in late antiquity these books were an essential part of the medical curriculum, and all medieval physicians, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian, were expected to have mastered their comments. Students of scientific subjects commenced their studies with either these particular books, or at least their subject-matter, e.g., how we categorize the world we experience, what sorts of properties distinguish natural kinds from each other, and how we combine our concepts to form judgments about the world.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first three books of the Organon were never translated into Hebrew. Instead, paraphrases of them by the 12th century Muslim philosopher Averroes (Ibn Rushd) were translated from the original Arabic into Hebrew in Naples by Jacob Anatoli in 1232 (together with the next two books of the Organon, the Prior and Posterior Analytics, on syllogistic inference and scientific demonstration, respectively.) Averroes’ paraphrases or “Middle Commentaries” of the first three works are extant in over eighty Hebrew manuscripts (and likely more), making them, according to the great literary historian and bibliographer, Moritz Steinschneider, the most popular works in Hebrew written by a non-Jew. They were commented upon by Jewish savants such as Levi Gersonides in the fourteenth century, and Judah Messer Leon in the fifteenth century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The particular commentary found in the Schoenberg Collection (LJS 229) is anonymous and has not yet been studied. No other copy of it exists, to my knowledge, but the section on the De Interpretatione is found in Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cod. hebr. 46. The commentator refers often to the logical writings of the 10th century Muslim philosopher, Alfarabi, some of which were translated into Hebrew in the late 12th and early 13th century. He also refers to the Arabic version of Averroes’ text. But, most interestingly, he cites and criticizes at least once the interpretation of “my teacher, R. Levi,” which a cursory comparison of the manuscripts reveals to be Gersonides. If this is correct, then the author of the commentary in LJS 229 was another member of Gersonides’ “school,” where students read texts with Gersonides and occasionally wrote their own glosses as comments, as has recently been studied by Prof. Ruth Glasner of Hebrew University. Since Gersonides also refers to the Arabic version of Averroes, this manuscript sheds additional light on the methodology employed by members of Gersonides’ circle.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As interesting as the anonymous commentary is in itself, the physical codex sheds light on the intellectual life of Provence in the second half of the 15th century. One finds the following statement of ownership in Latin: “Iste liber est meus mestre Benustruc\\[?\\] Avidor.” This individual may be identified with the 15th century ProvenC’al savant, Avigdor Benastruc, who translated into Hebrew around 1490 the anonymous French Romance of Belle Maguelone, and who wrote a manuscript that included works by the Provencal Jewish scholar, Isaac Nathan, the composer of the first Hebrew concordance of the Bible. If that is the case, it shows that as late as the late fifteenth century, if not later, basic works in Aristotelian logic were studied in Provence, and the influence of Gersonides and his students was still very much felt.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Alfonso, Esperanza.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Islamic Culture Through Jewish Eyes: Al-Andalus from the Tenth to the Twelfth Century.\u003C/em> (London; New York: Routledge, 2008).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Alfonso, Esperanza, et al.

These experiences have generated a rich body of political thought, but there has been an ongoing need to advance such thought in light of new developments in political theory and a changing world beyond academia. One way forward is to continue to stretch the boundaries of Jewish political thought in ways that intersect with the study of law, religion, history, literature, and other subjects, or that approach the subject in a comparative framework. During the 2016–2017 academic year, The Katz Center brought together scholars working in fields from ancient to contemporary philosophy and theory to unsettle regnant paradigms of power and statehood. They drew upon a wide variety of sources and interdisciplinary methodologies to challenge established understandings of Jewish political history.\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### Hannah Arendt's Origins of Totalitarianism\n\nJohn Ackerman\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/ackermantitle900%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/ackermanopening1200%402x.jpg)\n\nAt a time when contemporary political developments have been attracting new readers to Hannah Arendt’s Origins of Totalitarianism, it is worth revisiting Arendt’s argument in the book’s first volume, which looks to aspects of Jewish history—namely, relations between Jews and the societies and states amid which they lived—to explain the role that antisemitism came to play in mid-twentieth-century totalitarianism. In doing so, it makes several claims that have been contested fiercely by scholars of Jewish political history. Among these is the assertion that the Jewish people “began its history with a well-defined concept of history and an almost conscious resolution to achieve a well-circumscribed plan on earth and then, without giving up this concept, avoided all political action for two thousand years” (p. 8).\n\nArendt’s critics have interpreted this claim as a charge of “Jewish passivity” in the face of political exigencies and produced evidence to refute it. However, a careful reading of the “Antisemitism” volume, reinforced by many of Arendt’s other writings, shows that what was actually at stake for Arendt—and for Jewish politics—was something else. The avoidance of political action is hardly unique to the Jews, in Arendt’s eyes; it similarly characterizes the more than two thousand years since the first, Greek political philosophers “wished to turn against politics and against action” to secure certainties politics cannot provide (Arendt, The Human Condition, p. 195). The tendency to avoid and displace politics is a constant theme in Arendt’s writings. What Arendt critically narrates in the first volume of The Origins of Totalitarianism is a history of Jews (not all Jews, but certain Jewish elites who played an outsized role in relations between Jews and non-Jews) actively pursuing a strategy of vertical alliances that had the effect, in the short and longer term, of shielding Jews from political encounter with their non-Jewish neighbors. These alliances shored up patterns of rule (by Jewish “notables”) and exception (see Origins, pp. 62-64), that, as Arendt argues throughout her work, are often mistaken for politics but are actually at odds with it, patterns that easily become institutionalized and serve to benefit some at the expense of many others, and of politics as such.\n\nArendt’s argument, here and elsewhere, is that the avoidance of politics has ultimately proven and will continue to prove catastrophic. Politics requires continuing encounter and the ability to act together with—and where necessary, against—others different than ourselves, on the basis of judgments that can only be made where such encounter across lines of difference occurs. As Arendt’s Origins of Totalitarianismshows, it is the very possibility of this kind of political encounter that totalitarianism destroys, and it is this possibility that must be reconstituted if there is to be politics in totalitarianism’s wake. It is an argument that is just as relevant now as it was in 1951, including for the project of rethinking and expanding Jewish political thought.\n\n### A Jewish Genealogy of Political Economy\n\nSamuel Brody\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/brody-ch1-900%402x.jpg)\n\nPictured here are the opening pages of On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, originally published in England in 1817. Its first American edition, shown here, arrived only two years later. The author, David Ricardo (1772-1823), was one of the foremost of the classical political economists, usually ranked with Adam Smith, James Mill, and Thomas Malthus (the latter two of whom were his friends and correspondents). He was born into a Sephardic family that had moved to London from Amsterdam, and as a youth he accompanied his father Abraham to the Jews' Walk of the London bourse, pursuing an early career as a stockjobber. His marriage to Priscilla Ann Wilkinson, a Quaker, meant separation from the Jewish community, and his new identification as Unitarian meant that he was later eligible for a seat in the House of Commons (although legal action was required to exempt him from the Anglican rite).\n\nUnlike Smith, who made his name as a professor of moral philosophy with his Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) before turning to the Wealth of Nations (1776), Ricardo comes to prominence with treatises on bullion and corn prices. And in contrast to Malthus, whose notorious Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) contains probing theological inquiries, one searches Ricardo's Principles in vain for any hint that the problem of \"value\" has roots in moral discourse and significance for philosophy and religion. Indeed, Ricardo seems to come out of the blue as a secular economist. But for precisely this reason, his work can stand as a fascinating entryway into the story of the secularization of economic thought, and a marker of the paths to social and financial success open to (former) Jews in the England of the early nineteenth century.\n\n### Reading Zionist Texts: the Pathos of Historical Contingencies\n\nJulie Cooper\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooper-1-r900%402x_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/expanding-jewish-political-thought/reading-zionist-texts-pathos?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooper-1-v900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/expanding-jewish-political-thought/reading-zionist-texts-pathos?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooper-2-r900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/expanding-jewish-political-thought/reading-zionist-texts-pathos?item=2)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooper-2-v900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/expanding-jewish-political-thought/reading-zionist-texts-pathos?item=3)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooper-3-r900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/expanding-jewish-political-thought/reading-zionist-texts-pathos?item=4)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooper-3-v900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/expanding-jewish-political-thought/reading-zionist-texts-pathos?item=5)\n\nConducting archival research, one is often confronted with the pathos of history—the contingencies that render some texts lost or forgotten, while others are remembered and canonized. Moreover, some of the books that we remember bear traces of the circuitous paths by which they made their way into archival collections, while others betray no hints about their provenance, about the chains of scholarly transmission that brought them to the Katz Center.\n\nThis year, I devoted most of my time to reading Zionist texts from the first half of the twentieth century. On two occasions, I retrieved books from the stacks only to find that their pages were uncut, suggesting that I was the first person to read the Katz Center’s copy of these works (Hillel Zeitlin, Baruch Spinoza: His Life, Works, and System (1900) \\[Hebrew\\] and Hans Kohn, Die Politische Idee des Judentums (1924)). The excitement of discovery was tempered by a sadness that these books had sat unread for so many years.\n\nSeveral weeks later, I received a copy of Hans Kohn’s History of the Zionist Idea (1929) \\[Hebrew\\] from interlibrary loan. On the inside back cover, I found an old circulation card listing the book’s previous borrowers. Only one name was listed—that of Arthur Hertzberg, the editor of the influential anthology of Zionist writings The Zionist Idea (first published in 1959). In many ways, Hertzberg’s project mirrors that of Kohn—both sought to provide a concise introduction to the various schools of Zionist thought. Yet Hertzberg wrote in English, after the establishment of the State of Israel, and, consequently, offers a radically different account of the most influential Zionist thinkers and the most salient ideological debates. I can venture hypotheses as to why Hertzberg was drawn to Kohn’s work and how it may have influenced him, but they remain highly speculative, as the circulation card conveys no information other than the fact that Hertzberg once borrowed the book.\n\nWhile researching the work of Jacob Klatzkin (1882-1942), however, I stumbled upon unexpected evidence of concrete engagement on the part of at least one of the text’s prior readers. Dedicated to the project of developing a Hebrew philosophical idiom, Klatzkin is best known for his Otzar Ha Munahim Ha Philosophiim (1928) and his Hebrew translation of Spinoza’s Ethics, Torat ha-midot (1924). Some of Klatzkin’s Hebrew philosophical essays and aphorisms were published in English as In Praise of Wisdom (1943). When leafing through a library copy of In Praise of Wisdom, I was surprised to find the three index cards pictured at left—consecutive cards from the “A” drawer of a defunct library card catalogue—left by a prior reader. On the back of these cards from the old card catalogue, the reader has jotted key biographical and bibliographical details about Klatzkin, as well as a brief summary of Klatzkin’s analysis of the modern Jewish predicament and his disputes with his teacher Herman Cohen and with Ahad Ha’am. On the third card, the reader has recorded a shorthand for referring to two other Jewish thinkers from the period, Moshe Zeev Sole and Samuel Scheps. I do not know who jotted these notes or whether his/her research bore fruit, but it is gratifying to think that we are engaged in a serendipitous scholarly conversation about modern Jewish philosophy and political thought. I display the cards here as a testament to my anonymous interlocutor and his/her scholarly contributions.\n\n### Political Affairs—of State and Family—in a 19th-century Italian Commentary on Rabbinic Literature\n\nLois Dubin\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dubin1-900%402x.jpg)\n\nExegetical commentaries on Biblical and rabbinic texts are a rich source for Jewish political thinking. Benedetto Frizzi’s Petah Enayim (1st ed., 3 vols., Livorno 1815; 2d ed., 7 vols., Livorno 1878-81) provides an excellent example. Frizzi (1756-1844), a physician and wide-ranging scholar in northern Italy, wrote this commentary on the Ein Ya’akov, the 16th century collection of Talmudic Aggadah, in the spirit of Enlightenment science and natural philosophy. Even while calling for rationalist exegesis and social reform, he was committed to presenting classic Jewish teachings as relevant to modern concerns. Both excerpts from vol. 6, written around 1825, comment on passages in the Talmudic tractate Sanhedrin, and mention other works of his, in Italian, that treat political matters. Figure 1 shows the title page of vol. 6, from the 2nd edition.\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dubin2-2-900%402x.jpg)\n\nFigure 2: The excerpt on p. 78a (re: Sanhedrin 20b) refers to his book Diritto Pubblico Mosaico (1811; full title Dissertazione sulle leggi mosaiche relative al pubblico diritto) and discusses constitutions, kings and despots, including King Solomon and Emperor Napoleon. Frizzi, like many others, often viewed contemporary events through a Biblical lens, while also projecting contemporary issues backward onto the Bible itself. Indeed, to mix together religion and politics, past and present, is a persistent temptation of Jewish political thinking\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dubin3-900%402x%20%281%29.jpg)\n\nFigure 3: The excerpt on p. 81a (re: Sanhedrin 22a) refers to his six-volume book Dissertazione di Polizia Medica sul Pentateuco (1787-90), in particular vol. 3 on marriage, and discusses how divorce—though regrettable—is sometimes the best solution to marital quarrels and enmity.\n\nThroughout his commentary, Frizzi addresses politics on both planes—the macro public realm of state and law, and the micro level of private lives, family, and marriage and divorce. In one passage, Frizzi states that Jewish law should treat women more fairly with regard to divorce and inheritance so as not to lag behind contemporary Habsburg, Prussian, and English laws.\n\nThus Frizzi's Petah Enayim offers a rich potpourri of Jewish political thinking that weaves together Biblical and rabbinic exegesis with 18th-19th century social criticism and political ideas about rights, citizenship, and empancipation. For more on Frizzi’s ideas on love and marriage, you may consult another rare book in the Katz Center library: Hezekiah David Bolaffio’s work, Ben Zekunim (Livorno, 1793, part 2, p. 49), a collection of Halakhah and Hebrew poetry, which includes a poem by Frizzi on the qualities of an ideal wife!\n\n### Musical Utopia and Political Life: Ernst Hermann Meyer\n\nGolan Gur\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/gur1200%402x.jpg)\n\nThis photograph shows Ernst Hermann Meyer (1905-1988) composing at the piano in Berlin-Köpenick around 1970. All but forgotten today, Meyer was a key figure in the musical and cultural life of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). A composer, musicologist, and a university professor, he belonged to a small but prominent group of Jewish émigré intellectuals who moved to East Germany after 1945. This group included philosophers, composers, and authors such as Paul Dessau, Anna Seghers, Hans Mayer, and Ernst Bloch (both Mayer and Bloch later left for West Germany). Like other members of this group, Meyer’s decision to move to the GDR was motivated not only by the prospect of professional opportunities, but also—and perhaps primarily—by a strong, if in retrospect naive, belief that the new communist German state represented the \"better Germany\" and offered an opportunity to establish a democratic and just society devoid of the malaises of capitalism and nationalism.\n\nMeyer's family background was typical of the Berlin Jewish middle class with its strong trust in culture and learning. His father was a medical doctor who served in WWI and his mother was a painter who had studied with Max Liebermann. One of Meyer's most vivid childhood memories in connection with music was playing the violin with and for Albert Einstein who was a friend of his parents. Meyer studied composition with Paul Hindemith and completed his doctoral studies in musicology at the University of Berlin. During the 1930s, he came into contact with Hanns Eisler and his historical-materialist theory of music. Following Hitler’s seizure of power, Meyer used an opportunity to lecture in Cambridge in order to flee Nazi Germany. While in Great Britain, he continued to teach and compose and was active in various antifascist exile organizations. He moved to East Berlin in 1949 to take a position as Professor of Music Sociology at Humboldt University.\n\nAs a musicologist, Meyer was one of the pioneers of the social history of music. His direct models for this kind of research were the social histories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. His study of early English Chapter Music is still valuable today. His positions on the aesthetic problems of contemporary music, however, are more likely to raise objections. In his writings and speeches, he propagated the official Soviet doctrine of Socialist Realism as the proper approach for contemporary musical production. Meyer himself followed this line in much of the music he composed from the 1950s on. A great part of his creative production in the GDR was dedicated to vocal compositions of a political nature, but he also composed film scores as well as large instrumental works such as the symphony Kontraste, Konflikte, a work containing moments of conflict and gloomy expression, apparently in contrast to the aesthetic imperatives of Socialist Realism. Some of Meyer’s musical compositions, such as his Mansfeld Oratorio, evoke the memory of the Jewish Holocaust but almost always from the viewpoint of the GDR's national myth of antifascist resistance with its emphasis on economic relations as the basis for WWII and the rise of National Socialism (thus, distorting, or at least downplaying, the ideological background of National Socialism in antisemitism).\n\nMeyer died in October 1988, a year before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the final collapse of the Soviet Union. Being a committed communist for most of his adult life and a member of the Central Committee in the GDR, the way in which his life work is assessed today stands in direct relation to how the East German regime is viewed. Was he unaware of the extent of oppression in the GDR? Did he wholeheartedly believe in the system and its ideology? These questions must remain unanswered, but Meyer is one of many who, in their belief in the possibility of a perfect society, used the arts to promote a political utopia.\n\n### Women of the Wall\n\nYuval Jobani\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jobani1200%402x.jpg)\n\nThe “Women of the Wall” is a multi-denominational Jewish feminist group that seeks legal permission to perform, at the women’s section, practices reserved solely for men under the current arrangements at the Western Wall; namely to pray collectively and read aloud from a Torah scroll while wearing fringed prayer shawls. Historical surveys of prayer practices at the Western Wall in fact show that several gender-related arrangements currently in place at the site are not actually traditional. Most noticeably, perhaps, is the gender divider. This photograph, by Felix Bonfils, as do an abundance of other documentations from the late 19th and early 20th century, illustrates the lack of a formally organized and constant separation of men and women at the Western Wall. The two sexes were frequently depicted together, at times only a few feet away from each other. Gender separation practiced at the Western Wall today, therefore, stems from relatively late modifications to the prayer arrangements that had been maintained at the site for centuries.\n\n### James Harrington's Proposal for Jewish Sovereignty\n\nMeirav Jones\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jones-title900%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jones-dedic-900%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jones-p1-900%402x_0.jpg)\n\nJames Harrington’s Commonwealth of Oceana, of which a first edition from London, 1656 can be found in the Kislak Collections, is usually studied as an important text in the history of modern political thought for its bringing Roman republicanism and Machiavellian ideas to early-modern England in its only “republican” period. But those interested in Jewish politics and Jewish political thought will find this work interesting for another reason: It contains the a proposal for modern Jewish sovereignty, two-hundred years before this idea is usually considered to have entered modern political discourse.\n\nHarrington’s proposal is that rather than incorporate Jews into England, which Cromwell was considering as Harrington was writing, Jews should be settled in Ireland, displacing Ireland’s (Catholic) population as they gathered there from the corners of the earth. The proposal was that Jews should be allowed to live there under their own laws and institutions, with an army to protect them, and that this arrangement would be for them and their heirs in perpetuity.\n\nThe proposal is built on three foundations:\n\nThe first foundation is “political Hebraism”. As political thinkers from the mid-sixteenth century had argued, Jews held exemplary political, economic, and agricultural wisdom. Harrington was the first to suggest that this wisdom could be employed by contemporary Jews towards running their own state.\n\nThe second foundation is the political-theory discussion of the role of religion in stabilizing sovereignty. Since Bodin’s founational work, theorists consistently argued, with few exceptions, that the modern state required some degree of conformity to civil religion for its stability, and the Jews were considered a people who would not conform.\n\nThe third foundation is the debate surrounding the reintrodcuton of the Jews to England taking place in mid-seventeenth century England. This debate is likely what brought Harrington to go further than any other theorist in providing a concrete proposal for placing the Jews in the modern world of states: the matter was urgent immediately following the Whitehall conference (convened in 1655 to debate the readmission of Jews to England). “To receive the Jews after any other manner into a common-wealth were to maim it,” wrote Harrington, while realizing that his proposal would have been more pertinent “had it bin thought of in time.”\n\nThe reader interested in Harrington’s proposal should read the excerpt provided here, with the following guidelines: Oceana is Harrington’s model England, Marpesia his model Scotland, and Panopea his model Ireland.\n\n### Cyrus Adler and the Politics of Jewish Philanthropy at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919\n\nRebecca Kobrin\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Kobrin355900_0.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Kobrin356900.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Kobrin357900.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Kobrin358900.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Kobrin359900.jpg)\n\nThis letter to Boris (Bernard) Bogen, head of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in Poland, along with Adler’s larger diary, illustrates the ways in which American Jews involved themselves in international political discussions following the Great War. American Jews, who sat at the table in the Paris Peace Conference, hoped to make the world safer for Jews. As this letter states, men like Adler were alarmed by the eruption of anti-Semitic violence in Poland, which many believed could become a liberal multi-ethnic political economy. Adler saw Poland as a great experiment in modern Jewish politics: a republic where Jews were not only citizens, but constituted a key minority voting bloc in the largest multi-ethnic East European state. He writes to Bogen, because the American Joint Distribution Committee which he represented in Poland, exemplifies how American Jews used the formidable strength of their dollars to effect change in Poland.\n\nWhile the intricacies of local politics caused the impact of American dollars to have differential effect in various locales in Poland, they gave men like Cyrus Adler, Jacob Schiff (also mentioned in the letter) and Boris (Bernard) Bogen a chance to spread their own cultural agenda. Wilson may have failed to convince the American government to involve themselves diplomatically in the politics of rebuilding in the region of Eastern Europe, it is clear that individual non-governmental organizations in America, like the JDC, and men like Cyrus Adler would assume the mantle of Wilsonian idealism as they distributed money and advocated for Jewish rights at the Paris Peace conference. This letter exemplifies why we must consider men like Adler—a private citizen using his economic might to affect change in the world around him—as we endeavor to expand the parameters of the Jewish political tradition.\n\n### Agamben's Homo Sacer: icons of a new form of politics\n\nNitzan Lebovic\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/lebovic852%402x.jpg)\n\nGiorgio Agamben’s Homo Sacer series—the first part published originally in Italian in 1995—places the figure of the Muselmann (the paradigmatic “Homo Sacer” or Sacred man) and her “naked life,” in the center of modern politics. It encounters the traditional political stress on sovereignty (“the prince”) with its negative projections, i.e. the victim or the figure of the excluded. The Jew, the immigrant, the rebel—are the icons of a new form of politics here. Committed to a critical thinking beyond left-right divisions or beyond Christian-Judaic separation, Agamben stresses the “threshold” as his springboard for a new critical examination of the law (in both theological and political terms). The Homo Sacer, he tells us, is the one who could be killed but not sacrificed, who exists outside both human and divine law.\n\nAgamben’s theory of politics identifies itself as “biopolitical critique.” It criticizes racial stereotypes side by side with other forms of “total sovereignty.” However, as such, it turns not only against explicit totalitarian regimes, such as Stalin’s and Hitler’s, but against the capitalist order, which identifies life with consumption, and the realization of the self with economic profit. Both fascism and capitalism try to reach a point of total control or a “total politicization of life,” according to Agamben. From this angle, the difference between totalitarianism and democracy is one of quantity, not quality, of coercion. In this brave new world, the Homo Sacer is no longer a Jewish Muselmann, but a Muslim immigrant, an oppressed woman, or a political critic.\n\n### Law, Actually: Code and Coercion in the works of Yosef Karo\n\nMordechai Levy-Eichel\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/levyeichel1900%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/levyeichel2900%402x.jpg)\n\nThe Bet Yosef (completed 1542, hereafter BY) and its subsequent revision and condensation, the Shulhan Arukh (published 1564–1565, Venice, hereafter SA) of Yosef Karo are the chief legal touchstones of early modern Jewry, exemplifying the scope, and limits, of halakhic commentary and codification. Both works follow the four part division of Ya’akov ben Asher’s fourteenth century, Arba'ah Turim. The BY was published as a commentary surrounding Asher’s work, while the SA was published as a stand-alone work, including in pocket-sized editions.\n\nPictured here, from the Sabbioneta edition of the BY, printed in 1559, is the fourth and final part, Hoshen Mishpat, named after the high priest’s breastplate. This volume, which contains a censor's inscription at the end, mainly treats the non-ritual aspects of leading a Jewish life (including questions of finance and sales, torts, and damages), but begins by noting how the courts should rightfully administer the law. Ironically, many of its strictures about how to follow the law—e.g., do not go before a gentile court (26:1)—exemplify ideal Jewish observance, as well as the fact that, in practice, such laws were often circumvented, excused (with or without certain halakhic qualifications), or just ignored by many, from the pious to the nefarious.\n\n### Jacob Lorberbaum's Netivot ha-Mishpat (The Paths of Law): A Basement Encounter\n\nMenachem Lorberbaum\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/lorberbaum900%402x.jpg)\n\nWalking through the florescent lit bookshelves of library stacks is always a pretense. The book one seeks is but an excuse for a treasure hunt in the oversized shelves or the nether reaches of a certain column one has never had reason to tour before. A solitary quest in search of reverie with a hitherto imagined volume has always been the greatest of rewards since my summer job as a young lad retrieving books for callers in the basements of the Hebrew National Library in Jerusalem. The call number is one thing, the trace leading the bookworm—another.\n\nThe Katz Center Library showed great promise from the first moment; indeed as soon as I realized that I was free to roam on my own. Then came the day and my eye glanced at a folder in the oversized shelves. A closer look revealed the name Netivot Ha-Mishpat, The Paths of Law, first edition (or what is left of it) by Rabbi Jacob Lorberbaum of Lissa. I pounced upon it. I took the folder and opened it looking at the famed commentary (1809) on the part of the Sulhan Arukh devoted to civil law, Hoshen ha-Mishpat. I made my way through the leaves chancing upon a famed discussion that could have been presented by a legal scholar in our seminar on Jewish political thought, even today, on the nature of representation.\n\nIt is clear that one can represent another if appointed to do so—but can one represent another without so being appointed? The Mishnah sets forth the principle that \"a person may be benefited even if not present.\"\n\nThat is, one person may act on behalf of another not present if the outcome is to the latter's benefit. The principle raises crucial questions: What constitutes a benefit? And if it involves acquisition may the latter rescind? Moreover: why? Is representation a matter of bestowing the right of action, of taking one's place, assuming one's power, or is a projected good enough to act on another's behalf (even if unknowingly). Thomas Hobbes uses the term 'personate' to capture the representative relation. Following this insight we can continue pursuing the rabbinic train of thought. In what sense of 'person'? In our physical capacity or our legal capacity as legal agents. Following various talumudic sources Rabbi Jacob's discussion and the retorts of his colleagues suggest that our approach depends on the governing metaphor of representative action: is it an extension of one's hand or of one's competence, power?\n\nAt this point, completely lost in thought, I heard the elevator in the background—someone was coming!—and not waiting to follow the thought through I hastily put away the loose leaves in their folder and returned to the mundane respectability of the call number I originally had jotted down on my yellow sticky paper.\n\n### Abraham Ankawa: Kerem Hemer\n\nVered Sakal\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sakal900%402x.jpg)\n\nAbraham ben Mordecai Ankawa was born in in Salé, Morocco, in 1810, to a family of Spanish origin (one of his ancestors is Ephraim Ankawa who escaped the Spanish Inquisition and, according to legend, came to the Maghreb mounted on a lion). Ankawa settled in Algeria in 1846, fourteen years after the French began their colonial conquest, and was nominated by the French authorities as a _rabbin indigène_ in 1859. His _responsa_ book, Kerem Ḥemer, was printed in Livorno in 1869–71. It is a collection of _responsa_ in two volumes. The first volume is arranged according to the four parts of _Shulḥan Arukh_—covering most aspects of Jewish life, it discusses matters of ritual, _kashruth,_ marriage and finance. The second volume opens with _Sefer ha-Takkanot_—a collection of regulations written by rabbis of Castilian origin, which Ankawa copies and publishes in order to prevent their loss. The volume also includes some of the rulings made by Rabbi Raphael Berdugo (a notable Moroccan rabbi, 1747-1821) and additional _responsa_ from Ankawa.\n\nIt is important to note that Ankawa's rabbinical biography and bibliography resonates strongly with the chronology of the French colonial regime in Algeria: by 1859 Ankawa and his colleagues were allowed to rule only on marital matters and religious–ritual issues. And at the time Kerem Hemer was published, the Crémieux decree had naturalized most of the Jews in Algeria and officially subordinated them to French family law, thus dissolving the last aspect of Jewish law that had some kind of jurisdictional autonomy. It seems then, that the fact that Ankawa publishes a book of _responsa_ subsequent to the mass naturalization requires an explanation.\n\nOne option we should consider is that Ankawa publishes Kerem Hemer in order to provide Algerian halakhah with a 'decent burial' (if we are to utilize Scholem's portrayal of Moritz Steinschneider's work and all of the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement). Another possibility is to describe Kerem Hemer as an act of cultural defiance against colonial patronage that privileges certain practices or ideas over others; a demonstration of resistance to the colonial regime's effort to marginalize local and independent Jewish ruling. In contrast with the French-colonial compartmentalizing approach, which sought to separate between politics, religion and law by setting geographical as well as clerical boundaries, Kerem Hemer should be understood as a counter religio-political project that defies colonial attempts to demolish and reconstruct indigenous religiosity.\n\n### Martin Buber's Three Speeches on Judaism\n\nOrr Scharf\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/scharf1200%402x.jpg)\n\nFirst editions can be precious little treasures. Their tactility and physical layout are like time capsules that preserve something tangible from the moment of their production. Flipping through a first edition’s pages one is easily tempted to transport oneself to the author’s time and place and absorb the setting that inspired him or her to write a work that can still stir, perplex and invigorate our minds today. First editions are also valuable for capturing most genuinely the author’s position on the subject matter, which many times is changed or revised in subsequent editions. Martin Buber’s Drei Reden über das Judentum (Three Speeches on Judaism), a copy of whose first edition (1911) is held at the Katz Center library is such a specimen. Between the lines that moved Buber’s admiring audience in Prague, where he delivered the speeches, and thousands of subsequent readers, one may find his initial thoughts about the place of Gnosticism in the evolution of Christianity. This is probably the first text in which Buber describes the rift torn between Christianity and Judaism as having been caused by the Gnostic influences on Paul the Apostle, while Jesus’ teachings still maintained close affinities with the faith of Israel. This kernel of an idea sustained years of research and writing on the subject on Buber’s part. More than a century after its publication, Drei Reden remains a beautifully crafted book of puzzles awaiting further exploration.\n\n### Richelieu in \"Marrano Garb\"\n\nClaude B. Stuczynski\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/stuczynski900%402x.jpg)\n\nThe Converso poet João Pinto Delgado (Portimão 1580–Amsterdam 1653) dedicated his Poema de la Reina Ester; Lamentaciones del profeta Jeremías; Historia de Rut y varias poesías (Rouen: David du Petit Val, 1627) to Cardinal Richelieu (1585–1642). In the preface to this collection of mostly biblical verses written during his French exile, Pinto Delgado gave two reasons for offering the book to King Louis XIII's almighty minister. On the one hand, Richelieu acted like \"the most generous spirits\" by protecting strangers (\"amparar a los peregrinos\") like him and encouraging them to serve their hosting Princes through their military or literary skills (\"unos por armas, y otros por letras\"). The hospitality of the \"holy Patriarchs\" of the Bible was mentioned by the Converso poet as the archetype of Richelieu's praiseworthy behavior. On the other hand, his particular way of doing politics (\"de ser peregrino en todas sus acciones\") revealed that he was an outstanding minister. Knowing how to navigate the \"ship\" of the State like a \"skilled pilot\" and the army as \"a wise captain\", France's solid foundations relied on Richelieu's virtues. Arousing fear among enemies, respect of friends and commitment of the vassals, Cardinal Richelieu was the embodiment of the perfect political leader. Employing a set of political concepts and metaphors widespread by Jean Bodin's Les Six livres de la République (The Six Books of the Republic. 1576), Pinto Delgado saluted Richelieu for \"winning that love\" of the subjects vis-a-vis their sovereign \"which perpetuates kingdoms.\"\n\nPinto Delgado reminded that the books of Ester and Ruth, as well as the Lamentations of Jeremiah, showed how fragile are human beings. Living on earth as perpetual \"wanderers\" (\"peregrinos\"), the safe haven he personally found in Richelieu's France (\"allando yo un Puerto seguro, refugio de más naufragios\") along with many other Conversos exiles who fled the Iberian Inquisitions and the exclusion of the \"laws of purity of blood\", deserved to be publicly acknowledged and praised. At the same time, by depicting the Cardinal Richelieu in such a way, Pinto Delgado was implicitly acting as a sophisticated Converso political thinker: showing that Richelieu's model of combining Catholic religion, absolutistic political penchants and a minimal dose of freedom of conscience was a preferable alternative to the Iberian confessional intolerant and centrifugal model in a broader Converso phenomenon of political agency I called: \"Marrano in Richelieu's garb.\"\n\n### Simone Luzzatto, Italian Humanism, and the Reason-of-State Political Tradition\n\nVasileios Syros\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/syros900%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-12/Luzzato900%402x.jpg)\n\nSimone Luzzatto’s Discorso circa il stato de gl’Hebrei et in particolar dimoranti nell’inclita città di Venetia (Discourse concerning the Condition of the Jews, and in Particular Those Residing in the Illustrious City of Venice) appeared in 1638, in the aftermath of allegations about Jewish involvement in the bribery of the Venetian judiciary. The work was addressed to the Venetian authorities and is one of the first political treatises written by a Jewish author in the Italian vernacular. The Discorsoadumbrates a number of themes discussed in Luzzatto’s other major work the Socrate, overo dell’humano sapere (Socrates; or, About Human Knowledge, 1651), a fictive dialogue among various ancient Greek philosophical figures on a variety of topics related to human knowledge. It attests to the author’s exposure to Italian Humanism and the Greek legacy. It also reflects Luzzatto’s deep engagement with diverse streams of early modern political thought, particularly Niccolò Machiavelli’s thinking and the reason-of-state tradition. The work is informed by Luzzatto’s concern with the foundations and features of a strong economy and the contribution of the Jewish community to Venetian trade. As such, it encapsulates a set of insights relevant to current debates on the interface of religious or ethnic diversity and economic growth.\n\n### The Politics of Library Collecting: David Oppenheim, chief rabbi of Prague (1703-1736)\n\nJoshua Teplitsky\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/teplitsky1200%402x.jpg)\n\nThe volume Collectio Davidis/Qohellet David was published in 1826 in Hamburg, Germany, and was the final catalogue of a collection that had been inventoried every few decades since it was initiated in the 1670s. Behind a registry enumerating books and manuscripts in varying sizes, shapes, and paper qualities lie the activities of a collector, David Oppenheim, chief rabbi of Prague from 1703-1736. Over the course of five and a half decades, Oppenheim collected and created books and manuscripts, circulating literary material across Europe and the Mediterranean basin. He patronized the creation of new books in Hebrew and Yiddish, was visited by learned Christian Hebraists, directed philanthropy to the Land of Israel, and acted as a decisor and power-broker for Jews and their communal institutions across Central Europe.\n\nBoth as material objects and intellectual artifacts the books in this collection reveal elements of Jewish political culture: the knowledge stored in his collection was essential to the daily governance and religious lives of autonomous Jewish communities, while the motion of these objects themselves reveal the flows of favor and gift-giving—the non-institutional side of politics and administration—that were essential to the conditions of premodern Jewish collective organization.\n\n### Writers' Words and State Building\n\nGiddon Ticotsky\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/ticotsky-March900%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/ticotsky-Oct900%402x.jpg)\n\nIn March 1949, as the guns of the Independence War were falling silent, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion held a meeting with some forty Hebrew authors, poets and intellectuals to discuss the shaping of the young state's spiritual image, as well as the absorption of the huge immigration waves and other fundamental issues. This meeting was followed by another one, held in October 1949.\n\nDetailed minutes of the two meetings were published by the Government Printer, shortly after each meeting, titled Divrei Sofrim (Writers' Words: alluding to biblical scribes or adjudicators). These two booklets document an ideologically charged encounter between the Hebrew Republic of Letters and the nascent state. At the same time they shed light on the key role Hebrew authors used to have—and may still have today—in Israeli society, perhaps much more than their counterparts in other Western societies.\n\n### Ben Gurion's Dedication\n\nGiddon Ticotsky\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/ticotsky-dedication1200%402x.jpg)\n\nThe Library at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies holds a rare copy of Ben-Gurion's collected essays, Hazon ve-derekh (Vision and a Path) with his dedication to his wife. It reads as follows (in English translation): \"To Paula, with love, 'I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown' – David.\" The verse from Jeremiah (2:2, English Standard Version) probably refers to the Ben-Gurion family's move to the wilderness of the Negev desert in southern Israel, after he resigned from his position in 1953. The fifth volume of his essays, which carries this dedication, was published in 1957, two years after he became Prime Minister again.\n\n### Hospitals as Instruments of Politics\n\nIrene Tucker\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/tucker1200%402x.jpg)\n\nTwo recent, highly acclaimed Israeli novels, David Grossman’s Ishah borahat mi-besorah (Woman Flees from the News/To the End of the Land) and Ayelet Gundar-Goshen’s Le-hair aryot (Waking Lions) represent hospitals as institutions uniquely capable of serving the diverse population of contemporary Israel and environs. In these accounts, hospitals—some of them operating underground, in remote basements or overlooked garages in the middle of the Negev, others in plain sight on expansive urban campuses—offer care to Jewish Israelis, Palestinian citizens and non-citizens of Israel, guest workers and refugees from the Philippines and central Africa, without regard to their political status, their capacity to pay, or even their social legibility. Where political institutions and the culture at large might fail in their aspiration to treat all people as deserving of equal access to resources and legal protections, hospitals make such equal access their operating credo. In these novels, hospitals function as a sort of state beyond politics.\n\nIn fact, far from functioning outside politics, from the middle of the nineteenth-century onward, hospitals in the Middle East were central instruments for creating a political presence where none had existed. Because English Protestant missionaries lacked the status of “keepers of Christian Holy Places” granted the Catholic, Armenian and Greek Orthodox Churches, they were not allowed to settle in Palestine under the Ottoman Empire. As Yaron Perry and Ephraim Lev document in their 2007 Modern Medicine in the Holy Land: Pioneering British Medical Services in Late Ottoman Palestine, a missionary organization known as “The London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews,” used the occasion of a protracted military clash between Egyptian Governor Muhammed Ali and the military forces of the Ottoman Empire during the 1830s to gain a foothold in Jerusalem. By founding a hospital that would offer treatment to the many residents of Palestine vulnerable to malaria and other sicknesses endemic to the region, the London Jews Society imagined that they might establish a presence Muslim, Jewish and Christian residents of Jerusalem would regard with gratitude, rather than see as an incursion. It was the establishment of this hospital (pictured at left) and many other missionary-run hospitals like it that paved the wave for the British presence in fin de siècle Palestine that culminated in the recognition of postwar British Mandate.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Ackerman, John.** _The Politics of Political Theology: Rosenzweig, Schmitt, Arendt \\[dissertation\\]._ Chicago, Northwestern University, 2013.\n    \n*   **Ben Shitrit, Lihi.** _Righteous Transgressions: Women's Activism on the Israeli and Palestinian Religious Right._ under contract, Princeton University Press.\n    \n*   **Brody, Samuel.** _This Pathless Hour: Messianism, Anarchism, Zionism, and Martin Buber's Theopolitics Reconsidered \\[dissertation\\]._ Chicago, University of Chicago, 2013.\n    \n*   **Cooper, Julie.** _Secular Powers: Humility in Modern Political Thought._ Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013.\n    \n*   **Dubin, Lois C.** _The Port Jews of Habsburg Trieste: Absolutist Politics and Enlightenment Culture._ Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999.\n    \n*   **Edrei, Arye.** \"From Orthodoxy to Religious Zionism: Rabbi Kook and the Sabbatical Year Polemic,\" in _Dine Israel: Studies in Halakhah and Jewish Law_ )26-27 (2009-2010), 45-145).\n    \n*   **Gur, Golan.** _Orakelnde Musik: Schoenberg, der Fortschritt und die Avantgarde._ Kassel: Baerenreiter 2013.\n    \n*   **Jobani, Yuval and Perez, Nahshon.** _Women of the Wall: Navigating Religion in Sacred Sites._ Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017.\n    \n*   **Jones, Meirav; Oz-Salzberger; Fania; Schochet, Gordon, eds.** _Political Hebraism: Judaic Sources in Early Modern Political Thought._ \\[Israel\\] Shalem Press, 2008.\n    \n*   **Kobrin, Rebecca A.** _Jewish Bialystok and Its Diaspora._ Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2010.\n    \n*   **Lebovic, Nitzan.** _The Philosophy of Life and Death: Ludwig Klages and the Rise of a Nazi Biopolitics._ New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.\n    \n*   **Levy-Eichel, Mordechai.** \"Into the Mathematical Ocean: Navigation, Education, and the Expansion of Numeracy in Early Modern England and the Atlantic World,\", \\[dissertation\\] (New Haven: Yale University, 2015).\n    \n*   **Lorberbaum, Mordechai.** _Politics and the Limits of Law: Secularizing the Political in Medieval Jewish Thought._ Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2002.\n    \n*   **Sakal, Vered.** \"Two Conceptions of Religious Self in Lockean Religiosity,\" in _The Journal of Religion_ (96, 3 (July 2016): 332-345).\n    \n*   **Scharf, Orr.** _Thinking in Translation: Scripture and Redemption in the Thought of Franz Rosenzweig._ New York: W.

These experiences have generated a rich body of political thought, but there has been an ongoing need to advance such thought in light of new developments in political theory and a changing world beyond academia. One way forward is to continue to stretch the boundaries of Jewish political thought in ways that intersect with the study of law, religion, history, literature, and other subjects, or that approach the subject in a comparative framework. During the 2016–2017 academic year, The Katz Center brought together scholars working in fields from ancient to contemporary philosophy and theory to unsettle regnant paradigms of power and statehood. They drew upon a wide variety of sources and interdisciplinary methodologies to challenge established understandings of Jewish political history.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"hannah-arendts-origins-of-totalitarianism\">Hannah Arendt’s Origins of Totalitarianism\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>John Ackerman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/ackermantitle900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/ackermanopening1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At a time when contemporary political developments have been attracting new readers to Hannah Arendt’s Origins of Totalitarianism, it is worth revisiting Arendt’s argument in the book’s first volume, which looks to aspects of Jewish history—namely, relations between Jews and the societies and states amid which they lived—to explain the role that antisemitism came to play in mid-twentieth-century totalitarianism. In doing so, it makes several claims that have been contested fiercely by scholars of Jewish political history. Among these is the assertion that the Jewish people “began its history with a well-defined concept of history and an almost conscious resolution to achieve a well-circumscribed plan on earth and then, without giving up this concept, avoided all political action for two thousand years” (p. 8).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Arendt’s critics have interpreted this claim as a charge of “Jewish passivity” in the face of political exigencies and produced evidence to refute it. However, a careful reading of the “Antisemitism” volume, reinforced by many of Arendt’s other writings, shows that what was actually at stake for Arendt—and for Jewish politics—was something else. The avoidance of political action is hardly unique to the Jews, in Arendt’s eyes; it similarly characterizes the more than two thousand years since the first, Greek political philosophers “wished to turn against politics and against action” to secure certainties politics cannot provide (Arendt, The Human Condition, p. 195). The tendency to avoid and displace politics is a constant theme in Arendt’s writings. What Arendt critically narrates in the first volume of The Origins of Totalitarianism is a history of Jews (not all Jews, but certain Jewish elites who played an outsized role in relations between Jews and non-Jews) actively pursuing a strategy of vertical alliances that had the effect, in the short and longer term, of shielding Jews from political encounter with their non-Jewish neighbors. These alliances shored up patterns of rule (by Jewish “notables”) and exception (see Origins, pp. 62-64), that, as Arendt argues throughout her work, are often mistaken for politics but are actually at odds with it, patterns that easily become institutionalized and serve to benefit some at the expense of many others, and of politics as such.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Arendt’s argument, here and elsewhere, is that the avoidance of politics has ultimately proven and will continue to prove catastrophic. Politics requires continuing encounter and the ability to act together with—and where necessary, against—others different than ourselves, on the basis of judgments that can only be made where such encounter across lines of difference occurs. As Arendt’s Origins of Totalitarianismshows, it is the very possibility of this kind of political encounter that totalitarianism destroys, and it is this possibility that must be reconstituted if there is to be politics in totalitarianism’s wake. It is an argument that is just as relevant now as it was in 1951, including for the project of rethinking and expanding Jewish political thought.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"a-jewish-genealogy-of-political-economy\">A Jewish Genealogy of Political Economy\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Samuel Brody\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/brody-ch1-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pictured here are the opening pages of On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, originally published in England in 1817. Its first American edition, shown here, arrived only two years later. The author, David Ricardo (1772-1823), was one of the foremost of the classical political economists, usually ranked with Adam Smith, James Mill, and Thomas Malthus (the latter two of whom were his friends and correspondents). He was born into a Sephardic family that had moved to London from Amsterdam, and as a youth he accompanied his father Abraham to the Jews’ Walk of the London bourse, pursuing an early career as a stockjobber. His marriage to Priscilla Ann Wilkinson, a Quaker, meant separation from the Jewish community, and his new identification as Unitarian meant that he was later eligible for a seat in the House of Commons (although legal action was required to exempt him from the Anglican rite).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Unlike Smith, who made his name as a professor of moral philosophy with his Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) before turning to the Wealth of Nations (1776), Ricardo comes to prominence with treatises on bullion and corn prices. And in contrast to Malthus, whose notorious Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) contains probing theological inquiries, one searches Ricardo’s Principles in vain for any hint that the problem of “value” has roots in moral discourse and significance for philosophy and religion. Indeed, Ricardo seems to come out of the blue as a secular economist. But for precisely this reason, his work can stand as a fascinating entryway into the story of the secularization of economic thought, and a marker of the paths to social and financial success open to (former) Jews in the England of the early nineteenth century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"reading-zionist-texts-the-pathos-of-historical-contingencies\">Reading Zionist Texts: the Pathos of Historical Contingencies\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Julie Cooper\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/expanding-jewish-political-thought/reading-zionist-texts-pathos?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooper-1-r900%402x_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/expanding-jewish-political-thought/reading-zionist-texts-pathos?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooper-1-v900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/expanding-jewish-political-thought/reading-zionist-texts-pathos?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooper-2-r900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/expanding-jewish-political-thought/reading-zionist-texts-pathos?item=3\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooper-2-v900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/expanding-jewish-political-thought/reading-zionist-texts-pathos?item=4\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooper-3-r900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/expanding-jewish-political-thought/reading-zionist-texts-pathos?item=5\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooper-3-v900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Conducting archival research, one is often confronted with the pathos of history—the contingencies that render some texts lost or forgotten, while others are remembered and canonized. Moreover, some of the books that we remember bear traces of the circuitous paths by which they made their way into archival collections, while others betray no hints about their provenance, about the chains of scholarly transmission that brought them to the Katz Center.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This year, I devoted most of my time to reading Zionist texts from the first half of the twentieth century. On two occasions, I retrieved books from the stacks only to find that their pages were uncut, suggesting that I was the first person to read the Katz Center’s copy of these works (Hillel Zeitlin, Baruch Spinoza: His Life, Works, and System (1900) [Hebrew] and Hans Kohn, Die Politische Idee des Judentums (1924)). The excitement of discovery was tempered by a sadness that these books had sat unread for so many years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Several weeks later, I received a copy of Hans Kohn’s History of the Zionist Idea (1929) [Hebrew] from interlibrary loan. On the inside back cover, I found an old circulation card listing the book’s previous borrowers. Only one name was listed—that of Arthur Hertzberg, the editor of the influential anthology of Zionist writings The Zionist Idea (first published in 1959). In many ways, Hertzberg’s project mirrors that of Kohn—both sought to provide a concise introduction to the various schools of Zionist thought. Yet Hertzberg wrote in English, after the establishment of the State of Israel, and, consequently, offers a radically different account of the most influential Zionist thinkers and the most salient ideological debates. I can venture hypotheses as to why Hertzberg was drawn to Kohn’s work and how it may have influenced him, but they remain highly speculative, as the circulation card conveys no information other than the fact that Hertzberg once borrowed the book.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While researching the work of Jacob Klatzkin (1882-1942), however, I stumbled upon unexpected evidence of concrete engagement on the part of at least one of the text’s prior readers. Dedicated to the project of developing a Hebrew philosophical idiom, Klatzkin is best known for his Otzar Ha Munahim Ha Philosophiim (1928) and his Hebrew translation of Spinoza’s Ethics, Torat ha-midot (1924). Some of Klatzkin’s Hebrew philosophical essays and aphorisms were published in English as In Praise of Wisdom (1943). When leafing through a library copy of In Praise of Wisdom, I was surprised to find the three index cards pictured at left—consecutive cards from the “A” drawer of a defunct library card catalogue—left by a prior reader. On the back of these cards from the old card catalogue, the reader has jotted key biographical and bibliographical details about Klatzkin, as well as a brief summary of Klatzkin’s analysis of the modern Jewish predicament and his disputes with his teacher Herman Cohen and with Ahad Ha’am. On the third card, the reader has recorded a shorthand for referring to two other Jewish thinkers from the period, Moshe Zeev Sole and Samuel Scheps. I do not know who jotted these notes or whether his/her research bore fruit, but it is gratifying to think that we are engaged in a serendipitous scholarly conversation about modern Jewish philosophy and political thought. I display the cards here as a testament to my anonymous interlocutor and his/her scholarly contributions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"political-affairsof-state-and-familyin-a-19th-century-italian-commentary-on-rabbinic-literature\">Political Affairs—of State and Family—in a 19th-century Italian Commentary on Rabbinic Literature\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Lois Dubin\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dubin1-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Exegetical commentaries on Biblical and rabbinic texts are a rich source for Jewish political thinking. Benedetto Frizzi’s Petah Enayim (1st ed., 3 vols., Livorno 1815; 2d ed., 7 vols., Livorno 1878-81) provides an excellent example. Frizzi (1756-1844), a physician and wide-ranging scholar in northern Italy, wrote this commentary on the Ein Ya’akov, the 16th century collection of Talmudic Aggadah, in the spirit of Enlightenment science and natural philosophy. Even while calling for rationalist exegesis and social reform, he was committed to presenting classic Jewish teachings as relevant to modern concerns. Both excerpts from vol. 6, written around 1825, comment on passages in the Talmudic tractate Sanhedrin, and mention other works of his, in Italian, that treat political matters. Figure 1 shows the title page of vol. 6, from the 2nd edition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dubin2-2-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Figure 2: The excerpt on p. 78a (re: Sanhedrin 20b) refers to his book Diritto Pubblico Mosaico (1811; full title Dissertazione sulle leggi mosaiche relative al pubblico diritto) and discusses constitutions, kings and despots, including King Solomon and Emperor Napoleon. Frizzi, like many others, often viewed contemporary events through a Biblical lens, while also projecting contemporary issues backward onto the Bible itself. Indeed, to mix together religion and politics, past and present, is a persistent temptation of Jewish political thinking\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dubin3-900%402x%20%281%29.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Figure 3: The excerpt on p. 81a (re: Sanhedrin 22a) refers to his six-volume book Dissertazione di Polizia Medica sul Pentateuco (1787-90), in particular vol. 3 on marriage, and discusses how divorce—though regrettable—is sometimes the best solution to marital quarrels and enmity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Throughout his commentary, Frizzi addresses politics on both planes—the macro public realm of state and law, and the micro level of private lives, family, and marriage and divorce. In one passage, Frizzi states that Jewish law should treat women more fairly with regard to divorce and inheritance so as not to lag behind contemporary Habsburg, Prussian, and English laws.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thus Frizzi’s Petah Enayim offers a rich potpourri of Jewish political thinking that weaves together Biblical and rabbinic exegesis with 18th-19th century social criticism and political ideas about rights, citizenship, and empancipation. For more on Frizzi’s ideas on love and marriage, you may consult another rare book in the Katz Center library: Hezekiah David Bolaffio’s work, Ben Zekunim (Livorno, 1793, part 2, p. 49), a collection of Halakhah and Hebrew poetry, which includes a poem by Frizzi on the qualities of an ideal wife!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"musical-utopia-and-political-life-ernst-hermann-meyer\">Musical Utopia and Political Life: Ernst Hermann Meyer\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Golan Gur\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/gur1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This photograph shows Ernst Hermann Meyer (1905-1988) composing at the piano in Berlin-Köpenick around 1970. All but forgotten today, Meyer was a key figure in the musical and cultural life of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). A composer, musicologist, and a university professor, he belonged to a small but prominent group of Jewish émigré intellectuals who moved to East Germany after 1945. This group included philosophers, composers, and authors such as Paul Dessau, Anna Seghers, Hans Mayer, and Ernst Bloch (both Mayer and Bloch later left for West Germany). Like other members of this group, Meyer’s decision to move to the GDR was motivated not only by the prospect of professional opportunities, but also—and perhaps primarily—by a strong, if in retrospect naive, belief that the new communist German state represented the “better Germany” and offered an opportunity to establish a democratic and just society devoid of the malaises of capitalism and nationalism.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Meyer’s family background was typical of the Berlin Jewish middle class with its strong trust in culture and learning. His father was a medical doctor who served in WWI and his mother was a painter who had studied with Max Liebermann. One of Meyer’s most vivid childhood memories in connection with music was playing the violin with and for Albert Einstein who was a friend of his parents. Meyer studied composition with Paul Hindemith and completed his doctoral studies in musicology at the University of Berlin. During the 1930s, he came into contact with Hanns Eisler and his historical-materialist theory of music. Following Hitler’s seizure of power, Meyer used an opportunity to lecture in Cambridge in order to flee Nazi Germany. While in Great Britain, he continued to teach and compose and was active in various antifascist exile organizations. He moved to East Berlin in 1949 to take a position as Professor of Music Sociology at Humboldt University.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As a musicologist, Meyer was one of the pioneers of the social history of music. His direct models for this kind of research were the social histories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. His study of early English Chapter Music is still valuable today. His positions on the aesthetic problems of contemporary music, however, are more likely to raise objections. In his writings and speeches, he propagated the official Soviet doctrine of Socialist Realism as the proper approach for contemporary musical production. Meyer himself followed this line in much of the music he composed from the 1950s on. A great part of his creative production in the GDR was dedicated to vocal compositions of a political nature, but he also composed film scores as well as large instrumental works such as the symphony Kontraste, Konflikte, a work containing moments of conflict and gloomy expression, apparently in contrast to the aesthetic imperatives of Socialist Realism. Some of Meyer’s musical compositions, such as his Mansfeld Oratorio, evoke the memory of the Jewish Holocaust but almost always from the viewpoint of the GDR’s national myth of antifascist resistance with its emphasis on economic relations as the basis for WWII and the rise of National Socialism (thus, distorting, or at least downplaying, the ideological background of National Socialism in antisemitism).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Meyer died in October 1988, a year before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the final collapse of the Soviet Union. Being a committed communist for most of his adult life and a member of the Central Committee in the GDR, the way in which his life work is assessed today stands in direct relation to how the East German regime is viewed. Was he unaware of the extent of oppression in the GDR? Did he wholeheartedly believe in the system and its ideology? These questions must remain unanswered, but Meyer is one of many who, in their belief in the possibility of a perfect society, used the arts to promote a political utopia.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"women-of-the-wall\">Women of the Wall\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Yuval Jobani\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jobani1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The “Women of the Wall” is a multi-denominational Jewish feminist group that seeks legal permission to perform, at the women’s section, practices reserved solely for men under the current arrangements at the Western Wall; namely to pray collectively and read aloud from a Torah scroll while wearing fringed prayer shawls. Historical surveys of prayer practices at the Western Wall in fact show that several gender-related arrangements currently in place at the site are not actually traditional. Most noticeably, perhaps, is the gender divider. This photograph, by Felix Bonfils, as do an abundance of other documentations from the late 19th and early 20th century, illustrates the lack of a formally organized and constant separation of men and women at the Western Wall. The two sexes were frequently depicted together, at times only a few feet away from each other. Gender separation practiced at the Western Wall today, therefore, stems from relatively late modifications to the prayer arrangements that had been maintained at the site for centuries.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"james-harringtons-proposal-for-jewish-sovereignty\">James Harrington’s Proposal for Jewish Sovereignty\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Meirav Jones\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jones-title900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jones-dedic-900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jones-p1-900%402x_0.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>James Harrington’s Commonwealth of Oceana, of which a first edition from London, 1656 can be found in the Kislak Collections, is usually studied as an important text in the history of modern political thought for its bringing Roman republicanism and Machiavellian ideas to early-modern England in its only “republican” period. But those interested in Jewish politics and Jewish political thought will find this work interesting for another reason: It contains the a proposal for modern Jewish sovereignty, two-hundred years before this idea is usually considered to have entered modern political discourse.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Harrington’s proposal is that rather than incorporate Jews into England, which Cromwell was considering as Harrington was writing, Jews should be settled in Ireland, displacing Ireland’s (Catholic) population as they gathered there from the corners of the earth. The proposal was that Jews should be allowed to live there under their own laws and institutions, with an army to protect them, and that this arrangement would be for them and their heirs in perpetuity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The proposal is built on three foundations:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first foundation is “political Hebraism”. As political thinkers from the mid-sixteenth century had argued, Jews held exemplary political, economic, and agricultural wisdom. Harrington was the first to suggest that this wisdom could be employed by contemporary Jews towards running their own state.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The second foundation is the political-theory discussion of the role of religion in stabilizing sovereignty. Since Bodin’s founational work, theorists consistently argued, with few exceptions, that the modern state required some degree of conformity to civil religion for its stability, and the Jews were considered a people who would not conform.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The third foundation is the debate surrounding the reintrodcuton of the Jews to England taking place in mid-seventeenth century England. This debate is likely what brought Harrington to go further than any other theorist in providing a concrete proposal for placing the Jews in the modern world of states: the matter was urgent immediately following the Whitehall conference (convened in 1655 to debate the readmission of Jews to England). “To receive the Jews after any other manner into a common-wealth were to maim it,” wrote Harrington, while realizing that his proposal would have been more pertinent “had it bin thought of in time.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The reader interested in Harrington’s proposal should read the excerpt provided here, with the following guidelines: Oceana is Harrington’s model England, Marpesia his model Scotland, and Panopea his model Ireland.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"cyrus-adler-and-the-politics-of-jewish-philanthropy-at-the-paris-peace-conference-of-1919\">Cyrus Adler and the Politics of Jewish Philanthropy at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Rebecca Kobrin\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Kobrin355900_0.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Kobrin356900.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Kobrin357900.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Kobrin358900.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Kobrin359900.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This letter to Boris (Bernard) Bogen, head of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in Poland, along with Adler’s larger diary, illustrates the ways in which American Jews involved themselves in international political discussions following the Great War. American Jews, who sat at the table in the Paris Peace Conference, hoped to make the world safer for Jews. As this letter states, men like Adler were alarmed by the eruption of anti-Semitic violence in Poland, which many believed could become a liberal multi-ethnic political economy. Adler saw Poland as a great experiment in modern Jewish politics: a republic where Jews were not only citizens, but constituted a key minority voting bloc in the largest multi-ethnic East European state. He writes to Bogen, because the American Joint Distribution Committee which he represented in Poland, exemplifies how American Jews used the formidable strength of their dollars to effect change in Poland.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While the intricacies of local politics caused the impact of American dollars to have differential effect in various locales in Poland, they gave men like Cyrus Adler, Jacob Schiff (also mentioned in the letter) and Boris (Bernard) Bogen a chance to spread their own cultural agenda. Wilson may have failed to convince the American government to involve themselves diplomatically in the politics of rebuilding in the region of Eastern Europe, it is clear that individual non-governmental organizations in America, like the JDC, and men like Cyrus Adler would assume the mantle of Wilsonian idealism as they distributed money and advocated for Jewish rights at the Paris Peace conference.

It encounters the traditional political stress on sovereignty (“the prince”) with its negative projections, i.e. the victim or the figure of the excluded. The Jew, the immigrant, the rebel—are the icons of a new form of politics here. Committed to a critical thinking beyond left-right divisions or beyond Christian-Judaic separation, Agamben stresses the “threshold” as his springboard for a new critical examination of the law (in both theological and political terms). The Homo Sacer, he tells us, is the one who could be killed but not sacrificed, who exists outside both human and divine law.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Agamben’s theory of politics identifies itself as “biopolitical critique.” It criticizes racial stereotypes side by side with other forms of “total sovereignty.” However, as such, it turns not only against explicit totalitarian regimes, such as Stalin’s and Hitler’s, but against the capitalist order, which identifies life with consumption, and the realization of the self with economic profit. Both fascism and capitalism try to reach a point of total control or a “total politicization of life,” according to Agamben. From this angle, the difference between totalitarianism and democracy is one of quantity, not quality, of coercion. In this brave new world, the Homo Sacer is no longer a Jewish Muselmann, but a Muslim immigrant, an oppressed woman, or a political critic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"law-actually-code-and-coercion-in-the-works-of-yosef-karo\">Law, Actually: Code and Coercion in the works of Yosef Karo\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Mordechai Levy-Eichel\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/levyeichel1900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/levyeichel2900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Bet Yosef (completed 1542, hereafter BY) and its subsequent revision and condensation, the Shulhan Arukh (published 1564–1565, Venice, hereafter SA) of Yosef Karo are the chief legal touchstones of early modern Jewry, exemplifying the scope, and limits, of halakhic commentary and codification.

Ironically, many of its strictures about how to follow the law—e.g., do not go before a gentile court (26:1)—exemplify ideal Jewish observance, as well as the fact that, in practice, such laws were often circumvented, excused (with or without certain halakhic qualifications), or just ignored by many, from the pious to the nefarious.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"jacob-lorberbaums-netivot-ha-mishpat-the-paths-of-law-a-basement-encounter\">Jacob Lorberbaum’s Netivot ha-Mishpat (The Paths of Law): A Basement Encounter\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Menachem Lorberbaum\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/lorberbaum900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Walking through the florescent lit bookshelves of library stacks is always a pretense.

The call number is one thing, the trace leading the bookworm—another.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Katz Center Library showed great promise from the first moment; indeed as soon as I realized that I was free to roam on my own. Then came the day and my eye glanced at a folder in the oversized shelves. A closer look revealed the name Netivot Ha-Mishpat, The Paths of Law, first edition (or what is left of it) by Rabbi Jacob Lorberbaum of Lissa. I pounced upon it. I took the folder and opened it looking at the famed commentary (1809) on the part of the Sulhan Arukh devoted to civil law, Hoshen ha-Mishpat. I made my way through the leaves chancing upon a famed discussion that could have been presented by a legal scholar in our seminar on Jewish political thought, even today, on the nature of representation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It is clear that one can represent another if appointed to do so—but can one represent another without so being appointed?

The principle raises crucial questions: What constitutes a benefit? And if it involves acquisition may the latter rescind? Moreover: why? Is representation a matter of bestowing the right of action, of taking one’s place, assuming one’s power, or is a projected good enough to act on another’s behalf (even if unknowingly). Thomas Hobbes uses the term ‘personate’ to capture the representative relation. Following this insight we can continue pursuing the rabbinic train of thought. In what sense of ‘person’? In our physical capacity or our legal capacity as legal agents. Following various talumudic sources Rabbi Jacob’s discussion and the retorts of his colleagues suggest that our approach depends on the governing metaphor of representative action: is it an extension of one’s hand or of one’s competence, power?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At this point, completely lost in thought, I heard the elevator in the background—someone was coming!—and not waiting to follow the thought through I hastily put away the loose leaves in their folder and returned to the mundane respectability of the call number I originally had jotted down on my yellow sticky paper.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"abraham-ankawa-kerem-hemer\">Abraham Ankawa: Kerem Hemer\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Vered Sakal\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sakal900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Abraham ben Mordecai Ankawa was born in in Salé, Morocco, in 1810, to a family of Spanish origin (one of his ancestors is Ephraim Ankawa who escaped the Spanish Inquisition and, according to legend, came to the Maghreb mounted on a lion). Ankawa settled in Algeria in 1846, fourteen years after the French began their colonial conquest, and was nominated by the French authorities as a \u003Cem>rabbin indigène\u003C/em> in 1859. His \u003Cem>responsa\u003C/em> book, Kerem Ḥemer, was printed in Livorno in 1869–71. It is a collection of \u003Cem>responsa\u003C/em> in two volumes. The first volume is arranged according to the four parts of \u003Cem>Shulḥan Arukh\u003C/em>—covering most aspects of Jewish life, it discusses matters of ritual, \u003Cem>kashruth,\u003C/em> marriage and finance. The second volume opens with \u003Cem>Sefer ha-Takkanot\u003C/em>—a collection of regulations written by rabbis of Castilian origin, which Ankawa copies and publishes in order to prevent their loss. The volume also includes some of the rulings made by Rabbi Raphael Berdugo (a notable Moroccan rabbi, 1747-1821) and additional \u003Cem>responsa\u003C/em> from Ankawa.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It is important to note that Ankawa’s rabbinical biography and bibliography resonates strongly with the chronology of the French colonial regime in Algeria: by 1859 Ankawa and his colleagues were allowed to rule only on marital matters and religious–ritual issues. And at the time Kerem Hemer was published, the Crémieux decree had naturalized most of the Jews in Algeria and officially subordinated them to French family law, thus dissolving the last aspect of Jewish law that had some kind of jurisdictional autonomy. It seems then, that the fact that Ankawa publishes a book of \u003Cem>responsa\u003C/em> subsequent to the mass naturalization requires an explanation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One option we should consider is that Ankawa publishes Kerem Hemer in order to provide Algerian halakhah with a ‘decent burial’ (if we are to utilize Scholem’s portrayal of Moritz Steinschneider’s work and all of the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement). Another possibility is to describe Kerem Hemer as an act of cultural defiance against colonial patronage that privileges certain practices or ideas over others; a demonstration of resistance to the colonial regime’s effort to marginalize local and independent Jewish ruling. In contrast with the French-colonial compartmentalizing approach, which sought to separate between politics, religion and law by setting geographical as well as clerical boundaries, Kerem Hemer should be understood as a counter religio-political project that defies colonial attempts to demolish and reconstruct indigenous religiosity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"martin-bubers-three-speeches-on-judaism\">Martin Buber’s Three Speeches on Judaism\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Orr Scharf\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/scharf1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First editions can be precious little treasures.

First editions are also valuable for capturing most genuinely the author’s position on the subject matter, which many times is changed or revised in subsequent editions. Martin Buber’s Drei Reden über das Judentum (Three Speeches on Judaism), a copy of whose first edition (1911) is held at the Katz Center library is such a specimen. Between the lines that moved Buber’s admiring audience in Prague, where he delivered the speeches, and thousands of subsequent readers, one may find his initial thoughts about the place of Gnosticism in the evolution of Christianity. This is probably the first text in which Buber describes the rift torn between Christianity and Judaism as having been caused by the Gnostic influences on Paul the Apostle, while Jesus’ teachings still maintained close affinities with the faith of Israel. This kernel of an idea sustained years of research and writing on the subject on Buber’s part.

In the preface to this collection of mostly biblical verses written during his French exile, Pinto Delgado gave two reasons for offering the book to King Louis XIII’s almighty minister. On the one hand, Richelieu acted like “the most generous spirits” by protecting strangers (“amparar a los peregrinos”) like him and encouraging them to serve their hosting Princes through their military or literary skills (“unos por armas, y otros por letras”). The hospitality of the “holy Patriarchs” of the Bible was mentioned by the Converso poet as the archetype of Richelieu’s praiseworthy behavior. On the other hand, his particular way of doing politics (“de ser peregrino en todas sus acciones”) revealed that he was an outstanding minister. Knowing how to navigate the “ship” of the State like a “skilled pilot” and the army as “a wise captain”, France’s solid foundations relied on Richelieu’s virtues. Arousing fear among enemies, respect of friends and commitment of the vassals, Cardinal Richelieu was the embodiment of the perfect political leader. Employing a set of political concepts and metaphors widespread by Jean Bodin’s Les Six livres de la République (The Six Books of the Republic. 1576), Pinto Delgado saluted Richelieu for “winning that love” of the subjects vis-a-vis their sovereign “which perpetuates kingdoms.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pinto Delgado reminded that the books of Ester and Ruth, as well as the Lamentations of Jeremiah, showed how fragile are human beings. Living on earth as perpetual “wanderers” (“peregrinos”), the safe haven he personally found in Richelieu’s France (“allando yo un Puerto seguro, refugio de más naufragios”) along with many other Conversos exiles who fled the Iberian Inquisitions and the exclusion of the “laws of purity of blood”, deserved to be publicly acknowledged and praised. At the same time, by depicting the Cardinal Richelieu in such a way, Pinto Delgado was implicitly acting as a sophisticated Converso political thinker: showing that Richelieu’s model of combining Catholic religion, absolutistic political penchants and a minimal dose of freedom of conscience was a preferable alternative to the Iberian confessional intolerant and centrifugal model in a broader Converso phenomenon of political agency I called: “Marrano in Richelieu’s garb.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"simone-luzzatto-italian-humanism-and-the-reason-of-state-political-tradition\">Simone Luzzatto, Italian Humanism, and the Reason-of-State Political Tradition\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Vasileios Syros\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/syros900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105404im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-12/Luzzato900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Simone Luzzatto’s Discorso circa il stato de gl’Hebrei et in particolar dimoranti nell’inclita città di Venetia (Discourse concerning the Condition of the Jews, and in Particular Those Residing in the Illustrious City of Venice) appeared in 1638, in the aftermath of allegations about Jewish involvement in the bribery of the Venetian judiciary.

It attests to the author’s exposure to Italian Humanism and the Greek legacy. It also reflects Luzzatto’s deep engagement with diverse streams of early modern political thought, particularly Niccolò Machiavelli’s thinking and the reason-of-state tradition.

It reads as follows (in English translation): “To Paula, with love, ‘I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown’ – David.” The verse from Jeremiah (2:2, English Standard Version) probably refers to the Ben-Gurion family’s move to the wilderness of the Negev desert in southern Israel, after he resigned from his position in 1953.

In these accounts, hospitals—some of them operating underground, in remote basements or overlooked garages in the middle of the Negev, others in plain sight on expansive urban campuses—offer care to Jewish Israelis, Palestinian citizens and non-citizens of Israel, guest workers and refugees from the Philippines and central Africa, without regard to their political status, their capacity to pay, or even their social legibility. Where political institutions and the culture at large might fail in their aspiration to treat all people as deserving of equal access to resources and legal protections, hospitals make such equal access their operating credo. In these novels, hospitals function as a sort of state beyond politics.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In fact, far from functioning outside politics, from the middle of the nineteenth-century onward, hospitals in the Middle East were central instruments for creating a political presence where none had existed. Because English Protestant missionaries lacked the status of “keepers of Christian Holy Places” granted the Catholic, Armenian and Greek Orthodox Churches, they were not allowed to settle in Palestine under the Ottoman Empire. As Yaron Perry and Ephraim Lev document in their 2007 Modern Medicine in the Holy Land: Pioneering British Medical Services in Late Ottoman Palestine, a missionary organization known as “The London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews,” used the occasion of a protracted military clash between Egyptian Governor Muhammed Ali and the military forces of the Ottoman Empire during the 1830s to gain a foothold in Jerusalem. By founding a hospital that would offer treatment to the many residents of Palestine vulnerable to malaria and other sicknesses endemic to the region, the London Jews Society imagined that they might establish a presence Muslim, Jewish and Christian residents of Jerusalem would regard with gratitude, rather than see as an incursion. It was the establishment of this hospital (pictured at left) and many other missionary-run hospitals like it that paved the wave for the British presence in fin de siècle Palestine that culminated in the recognition of postwar British Mandate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Ackerman, John.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>The Politics of Political Theology: Rosenzweig, Schmitt, Arendt [dissertation].\u003C/em> Chicago, Northwestern University, 2013.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Ben Shitrit, Lihi.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Righteous Transgressions: Women’s Activism on the Israeli and Palestinian Religious Right.\u003C/em> under contract, Princeton University Press.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Brody, Samuel.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>This Pathless Hour: Messianism, Anarchism, Zionism, and Martin Buber’s Theopolitics Reconsidered [dissertation].\u003C/em> Chicago, University of Chicago, 2013.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Cooper, Julie.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Secular Powers: Humility in Modern Political Thought.\u003C/em> Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Dubin, Lois C.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>The Port Jews of Habsburg Trieste: Absolutist Politics and Enlightenment Culture.\u003C/em> Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Edrei, Arye.\u003C/strong> “From Orthodoxy to Religious Zionism: Rabbi Kook and the Sabbatical Year Polemic,” in \u003Cem>Dine Israel: Studies in Halakhah and Jewish Law\u003C/em> )26-27 (2009-2010), 45-145).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Gur, Golan.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Orakelnde Musik: Schoenberg, der Fortschritt und die Avantgarde.\u003C/em> Kassel: Baerenreiter 2013.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jobani, Yuval and Perez, Nahshon.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Women of the Wall: Navigating Religion in Sacred Sites.\u003C/em> Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jones, Meirav; Oz-Salzberger; Fania; Schochet, Gordon, eds.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Political Hebraism: Judaic Sources in Early Modern Political Thought.\u003C/em> [Israel] Shalem Press, 2008.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kobrin, Rebecca A.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Jewish Bialystok and Its Diaspora.\u003C/em> Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2010.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Lebovic, Nitzan.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>The Philosophy of Life and Death: Ludwig Klages and the Rise of a Nazi Biopolitics.\u003C/em> New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Levy-Eichel, Mordechai.\u003C/strong> “Into the Mathematical Ocean: Navigation, Education, and the Expansion of Numeracy in Early Modern England and the Atlantic World,”, [dissertation] (New Haven: Yale University, 2015).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Lorberbaum, Mordechai.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Politics and the Limits of Law: Secularizing the Political in Medieval Jewish Thought.\u003C/em> Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2002.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Sakal, Vered.\u003C/strong> “Two Conceptions of Religious Self in Lockean Religiosity,” in \u003Cem>The Journal of Religion\u003C/em> (96, 3 (July 2016): 332-345).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Scharf, Orr.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Thinking in Translation: Scripture and Redemption in the Thought of Franz Rosenzweig.\u003C/em> New York: W.

Intellectual and cultural exchange did occur between Jew and Christian during the Middle Ages, but paled by comparison with what occurred between 1450 and 1750. Encounters between cultures can be fruitful, but also very painful. Certainly Christian Hebraism had such effects both upon European Jewry, and upon western tradition.\n\nOne of the most tangible witnesses to the sudden and sustained popularity of Hebraica and Judaica among Christian writers and readers during this period are books. In addition to our discussions throughout the year and the final conference, we fellows would like to share some of the books that we found most intriguing or most useful in our research. Participating fellows have each chosen a book, written a short description of it and picked an illustration to go with it. Each of these books may be found in the library of the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies or at Van Pelt Library, the main library of the University of Pennsylvania. The understanding of Judaism held by the authors of these works is not always entirely accurate, and frequently they were involved in controversies that either baffle or infuriate contemporary readers, yet some of their work has stood the test of time. Christian Hebraism in its day mediated Jewish thought to the majority of western thinkers who could not read Hebrew and contributed to the emergence of several modern scholarly disciplines including cultural anthropology, comparative religion, and Jewish studies. This encounter with Judaism paradoxically served both to confirm traditional religious beliefs in some readers, while for others it fostered the skepticism, irreligion, and toleration normally associated with the Enlightenment. While Judaism's claim to be one of the three pillars of Western Civilization, together with Greek and Roman culture, rests primarily on the importance of the Hebrew Bible, Christian Hebraists in early modern Europe made their contribution by enriching western thought with a healthy dose of Jewish education.\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: right\">\u003Cstrong>Stephen Burnett\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\n### **Index by author of collection item**\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065216im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/logo_froben.jpg\" alt=\"Unidentified drawing (possibly a colophon) showing a caduceus supported by 2 hands.\" class=\"align-left\">\u003C/p>\n\nLancelot Addison, 1632-1703.

During his long and very active life, Llull continuously refined the Art and used it in polemic against Jews and Muslims to bring about their conversion. _The Book of the Gentile_, written between 1274-76 in Catalan and translated very rapidly into Latin, French and Spanish, portrays a cordial disputation between a Jew, Christian and Muslim for the edification of a Gentile utilising the framework of the _Art_. In the work, a large measure of tolerance is shown toward the other, and Llull reveals remarkable knowledge of contemporary Judaism and Islam. The last redaction of the framework of the _Art_ was the _Ars generalis ultima_ completed in 1308 along with the very popular _Ars brevis_. The latter is extant in a late fifteenth-century Hebrew translation, and was considered by its Jewish students as an excellent work for achieving divine revelation.\n\nIvo Salzinger (1669-1728), the editor of the Mainz edition wanted to portray Llull's _Art_ as a system of universal knowledge, and to defend Llull as an alchemist (which he was not). He amassed a large collection of manuscripts (now in the Munich Staatsbibliothek) and although he died after the first three volumes appeared, the work was continued by the new editor Philip Wolff. Only eight (I-VI, IX-X) of the ten volumes originally planned were ever published under the patronage of, first the Elector Palatine, and after his death, the Archbishop of Mainz.\n\n### _Pugio Fidei, ... adversus Mauros, et Iudaeos; nunc primym in lucem editus_\n\nOra Limor\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1651_Limor_Pugio_Fidei.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nRaymundus Maritini (Ramón Martí, 1220 - 1285) was the greatest Hebraist and orientalist of the Middle Ages, and the leading representative of the Spanish Dominican school in the polemic against the Jews. His knowledge of languages and his outstanding command of Biblical and post-Biblical Jewish literature knew no equal, neither in his own time nor in the following centuries.\n\nRaymundus studied Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic. In his opus magnum _Pugio fidei adversus Mauros and Iudaeos_ (_Dagger of Faith against Moslems and Jews_), written around 1280, he tried to prove Christianity's truth using Jewish sources: Talmud, Midrashic literature, Jewish exegesis, Jewish philosophy and Kabbalah. He believed that these sources hide old traditions which prove the main tenets of Christianity and which should be extracted from the Jewish books \"like pearls from a dunghill.\" His method was to bring the Jewish section in its Hebrew or Aramaic original, followed by a Latin translation and a commentary. Raymundus' aim was not to refute Jewish sources or to annihilate Jewish books, but to use them for Christian purposes. He looked for the sources - legends in particular - which included, so he believed, Christian truth, but also those that proved that contemporary Judaism was no longer the Biblical Judaism deserving of Christian tolerance.\n\nThe _Pugio_ made an immense contribution to Christian Hebrew scholarship and to Christian anti-Jewish polemics. For the first time Jewish rabbinical sources were exposed to Christian eyes. Christian polemicists in the following centuries (for example, in the Tortosa Disputation of 1413-1414) based their arguments on the _Pugio_, making it their polemical platform. The work also brings several rabbinical sayings which were later erased from Jewish manuscripts and printed editions, and for which it serves as the only source.\n\nTen manuscripts of the _Pugio fidei_ are known today. The book was printed in 1651 in Paris, and again in 1687 in Leipzig. It still awaits a critical edition.\n\n### _Sefer Shaʻar ha-ḥesheḳ_\n\nFabrizio Lelli\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1494_1860_lelli_alemanno2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nJohanan Allemanno was born in Italy to a French Ashkenazi family. As a philosopher, he appears to have adhered to the major concerns of the Renaissance revival of _studia humanitatis_. His portrayal of King Solomon as an outstanding paragon of both _humanitas_ and speculative activism follows Humanistic literary trends. In rendering Solomon a model for the Jew aspiring to the rational and mystical knowledge of God, Allemanno emphasizes Solomon's human qualities, his virtues as well as his vices. Allemanno reinterprets traditional Arabic and Hebrew sources using contemporary Humanistic reappraisals of classical rhetoric and biography.\n\nThis nineteenth century edition of the _Sefer sha\\`ar ha-heshek_ (_The Book of the Gate of Desire_) contains Allemanno's introduction to his commentary on the Song of Songs, entitled _Heshek Shelomoh_ (_Solomon's Desire_), which he had dedicated to the Humanist Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494). Pico, whom Alemanno first met in 1488, had originally turned to the Jewish scholar in search of Kabbalistic hermeneutic devices for a new interpretation of the Song of Songs. Together, they strove towards the formation of a syncretic system of rational and religious thought in an attempt to overcome ideological distinctions within intellectual milieus. Their remarkable collaboration lasted until Pico's death in 1494.\n\n### _Aldi Pii Manutii Institutionum grammaticarum libri quatuor: Erasmi Roterodami opusculum de octo orationis partium constructione: quae quoq\\[ue\\] libro continentur hanc uoluenti chartam statim se offerunt_\n\nSeth Jerchower\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1525_jerchower_manutius1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nAldo Manuzio's importance is not limited to the art and development of typography. The great Venetian printer was a prolific man of letters, having authored a number of extensive tractates on classical language and literature. After having mastered both Latin and Greek printing, he went on to forge a set of Hebrew types, which initially appeared in the 1499 _Hypnerotomachia Polyphili_. Approximately two years later, this font would be integrated into his _Alphabetum hebraicum_, the first Hebrew language primer printed by a Christian for Christians. However, it was also due to Aldus' business intrigues that the Jewish Soncino dynasty of printers was precluded from activity within the Venetian Republic (the privilege would be passed on in1516 to yet another Christian printer, Daniel Bomberg of Antwerp). The present piece is a 1523 reprint of Aldus' Greek Grammar, accompanied by a handbook of Latin by his contemporary, Desiderius Erasmus.\n\n### _Vetus testamentum multiplici lingua: nunc primo impressum; et imprimis Pentateuchus Hebraicus Greco atque Chaldaico idioma_\n\nChanita Goodblatt\n\n### [\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1514_comp_gen.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/vetus-testamentum-multiplici-lingua-nunc-primo?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1514_comp_pr6.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/vetus-testamentum-multiplici-lingua-nunc-primo?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1514_complutensia.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/vetus-testamentum-multiplici-lingua-nunc-primo?item=2)\n\nOne of the great achievements of Christian Hebraic Biblical scholarship, this polyglot edition was printed in Alcala de Henares, Spain by the University of Complutum (and hence known as the _Complutensian Polyglot_). Its six volumes were printed between 1514 and 1517, but difficulty in obtaining papal approval delayed official publication until 1521.\n\nThe first four volumes of this _Biblia Polyglotta_ contain the Hebrew Bible, volume 5 contains the Greek New Testament, and volume 6 contains various indices and study guides (including a Hebrew-Aramaic dictionary and a Hebrew grammar). The first page reproduced here is Genesis Chapter 1. Jerome's Vulgate translation is in the center of the page, between the Hebrew text on the right (with roots printed in the margin) and the Greek Septuagint (with an interlinear Latin translation) on the left. The Aramaic translation is found on the bottom left of the page, with its Latin translation to the right, and its roots printed in the margin.\n\nThe second page reproduced here provides an illuminating example of how the Complutensian Polyglot was used by Christian Hebraists in Early Modern England. The bottom of this page displays verses 1-10 from Proverbs: Chapter 6, and includes the Latin text in the center, with the Hebrew text on the right and the Greek text on the left. John Donne, one of the most famous preachers of his time, discusses these verses in a sermon given in 1621 (Sermons, Volume III: pp. 231-232): \"In the sixth Chapter of this booke, when Solomon had sent us to the Ant, to learne wisedome, betweene the eight verse and the ninth, he sends us to another schoole, to the Bee: _Vade ad Apem & disce quomodo operationem venerabilem facit_, 'Goe to the Bee, and learne how reverend and mysterious a worke she works.' For, though S. Hierome acknowledge, that in his time, this verse was not in the Hebrew text, yet it hath ever been in many Copies of the Septuagint, and though it be now left out in the Complutense Bible, and that which they call the _Kings_ \\[Antwerp Polyglot\\], yet it is in that still, which they value above all, the Vatican.\" What is important here is Donne's need to establish the source and authority for his reading of the Bible in a comparison of the Hebrew, Greek and Latin textual versions. To do so, he makes use of the Complutensian \\[as well as the Antwerp\\] Polyglot to establish the original integrity and meaning of the Hebrew text, further spotlighting the problems of variant Greek and Latin translations. In this manner the Polyglot Bibles served the Protestant preacher in his study of the various biblical texts and interpretive traditions.\n\n### _Psalterium, Hebreum, Grecum, Arabicum, & Chaldeum, cum tribus Latinus interpretationibus & glossis_\n\nSeth Jerchower\n\n### [\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1516_genoa.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/psalterium-hebreum-grecum-arabicum-chaldeum-cum-tribus?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1516_genoaa.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/psalterium-hebreum-grecum-arabicum-chaldeum-cum-tribus?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1516_genoab.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/psalterium-hebreum-grecum-arabicum-chaldeum-cum-tribus?item=2)\n\nWhile the _Complutensian Bible_ may have been the first polyglot to come off the printing press (commencing with the New Testament in 1514) it was not the first to be published. The entire enterprise was to take another three years, and the Inquisition prevented its public release until 1521.\n\nAlthough more limited in textual scope, the Genoa Psalter was both printed and released in 1516, and therefore qualifies as the first **published** polyglot Bible. An Arabic translation of Psalms was included with the Hebrew, Latin, Greek, and Aramaic versions, and this is arguably the earliest surviving instance of Arabic movable type. The Psalter holds yet an additional \"first\": at Psalm 19 verse 4 appears a curious scholium, giving a detailed account of Christopher Columbus' voyages: the earliest printed record of the discovery of the New World. Its inclusion is attributable to equal doses of mid-millennial fervor and civic pride, as it was a Genoese captain who finally brought together \"the four corners of the world.\"\n\n### _Sefer ha-Diḳduḳ = Grammatica Hebraica Absolvtissima..._\n\nStephen Burnett\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1525_burnett_muenster-levita.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nElijah b. Asher ha-Levi (1469-1549), called Elias Levita by Latin authors, was a gifted Hebrew grammarian, teacher and editor/annotator of Jewish books for the Bomberg press of Venice. He also played an instrumental role in the development of Christian Hebrew scholarship, both by tutoring Christian pupils such as Cardinal Viterbo and by writing Hebrew grammar books and lexicons in Hebrew which were easily adapted to Christian use. The first of Levitas books to be translated into Latin, in this case by Sebastian Münster, appeared in this Basel 1525 printing. Münster, Paul Fagius, and Johannes Campensis edited or translated a number of Levitas works, printing them in Basel, Paris, Isny, Cracow, and Louvain. At least 26 more printings of Levitas books, either in Latin or as diglot texts with both the Hebrew original and Latin translation, would appear in print between 1525 and 1610, quite apart from the numerous printings of his works in Hebrew alone, intended for Jewish readers. Although he remained a Jew throughout his life, Levita had a tremendous impact upon Christian Hebrew scholarship through books such as this one.\n\n### _Catechesis D.

In 1570, the _Catechism_ appeared for the first time in a polyglot form which included not only the original German, but Hebrew, Greek, and Latin translations of the text in parallel columns. This new edition was ideally suited to language instruction in schools since it included familiar texts in the less familiar biblical languages. While the text of the Ten Commandments could be copied from the Hebrew Bible, most of the catechism had to be translated into Hebrew for the first time. The copy held by the Center for Judaic Studies library is a good representative of this work in that it was printed at Wittenberg by the heirs of Johannes Krafft (_Crato_), a fairly successful Hebrew printer for the Protestant market. This firm produced 16 of the 25 printings of the polyglot catechism which appeared between 1570 and 1650, all except one of which were printed in Wittenberg. The perennial popularity of the polyglot catechism in Lutheran cities and territories demonstrates that Lutheran scholars too considered the study of Hebrew important, although their role in the development of Christian Hebrew scholarship has remained largely unacknowledged.\n\n### _Sefer ʻAḳedat Yitsḥaḳ..._\n\nSeth Jerchower\n\n### [\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1547_jerchower_akedat_ishaq1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/sefer-akedat-yitshak?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1547_jerchower_akedat_ishaq2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/sefer-akedat-yitshak?item=1)\n\nThe decades immediately preceding and ultimately culminating in the Spanish Expulsion were witness to ever-increasing efforts by the Iberian Church in episodes of conversion by coercion: Jews were forced to attend sermons to convince them of the errors of their faith. To counter this, the Aragonese rabbi Isaac ben Moses Arama (ca. 1420-1494) composed his own homilies and delivered them to the Jewish community. These homilies consisted of a philosophical defense of Judaism: the appeal of reason over the terrors of the establishment. Later, Arama collected and reorganized these sermons as his magnum opus, the _\\`Akedat Yitshak_. The title, which translates as _The Binding of Isaac_, is a fitting one, for indeed Arama masterfully binds the traditions and methods of midrashic exposition with those of philosophical demonstration. The _'Akedah_ rapidly gained favor among a Jewish readership whose demography was ironically expanded by the events of 1492. It would also gain notoriety within Christian circles, where it was perceived as a slanderous work against Christendom, its dogmas and its institutions. Like many other Jewish works, particularly core ones such as the Talmud, lexica, commentaries, and entire sections of liturgy, it was liable to censorship.\n\nCensorship as an official institution was a response to both the success of the printing press and the \\[arguably subsequent\\] threat of Protestantism. A first decree prescribing universal censorship was proclaimed in 1487 in a Bull issued by Innocent VIII. In 1516 a Bull by Leo X instituted the _imprimatur_, the pre-publication approbation. Universal enforcement would not occur, however, until the 1540's, after two events that sanctioned its implementation: the relegation of all censorship matters to the General Inquisition in 1542 by Paul III, and the recommendation of the Council of Trent in 1546 for a more active enforcement. What followed, _inter alia_, was the _Index librorum prohibitorum_ \\[_Index of Prohibited Books_\\], an en masse confiscation and \"correction\" of alleged illicit writings, Paul IV's infamous Bull _Cum nimis absurdum_, and the burning of books, not least of which was the Talmud. In 1554 Julius III decreed that any Hebrew book not bearing the _imprimatur_ fell subject to confiscation if it was deemed derogatory to Christianity. The book was given to a censor (often an apostate, who brought with him his knowledge of Hebrew; there is also evidence that faithful Jews played an ancillary role, possibly as an endeavour to save Jewish texts from obliteration) who would proceed to blot out the offensive passages. The final step was the placement of a \"censor's mark,\" usually consisting of a signature, date, and brief declaration of examination. Despite an explicit provision in Julius III's Bull, the books were typically not returned to their owners, but kept sequestered in church or convent libraries. Curiously, the same censors' names today recur in Judaica collections throughout the world, yet represent a relatively brief albeit intense period of activity restricted to a relatively minimal area: the Papal State and the Savoy. After having occupied northern Italy (1796-98), Napoleon shut down the convents and monasteries of these regions, leading to an abandonment of the libraries, and a sudden boom for collectors.\n\n### _Thesaurus linguae sanctae_\n\nSeth Jerchower\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/stephanus_grammar1548.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nPagnini, whose initial formation began under the tutelage of Girolamo Savonarola in Florence, is the likely emblematic albeit arcane figure of post-laurentian Christian Hebraism in Italy. His commentaries, grammars and translations were hailed by Christians and Jews alike, and his erudition and industry so impressed the Medicean Pope Leo X that he assumed the expenses of Pagnini's _Veteris et Novi Testamenti nova translatio_ (Lyons, 1527). The _Thesaurus linguae sanctae_ is Pagnini's translation of and exposition on the Biblical glossary _Sefer ha-shorashim_ (_Book of Roots_) by David Kimhi, the preeminent medieval grammarian of the Hebrew language.\n\nThe noted printer's mark of the Stephanus (Estienne) family of Paris epitomizes the attitudes of pre-Counter Reformation Christian Hebraism. Both the tree, a trope for Divine wisdom, and the motto, \"Noli altum sapere,\" are taken from Romans 11, verses 19-20: \"Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.

Its author, the sixteenth-century Italian Jew Azariah de' Rossi, was a polymath who was familiar not only with the texts of his own Jewish tradition, but also with Christian and pagan literature including comtemporary Christian Hebraists such as Sebastian M|nster, Augustinus Steuchus, and Pico della Mirandola. The book covers a wide range of topics including the origins of the Septuagint, Jewish chronology and the priestly vestments. In every subject de' Rossi was able to innovate, taking heed of the relevant Jewish and Christian scholarship. Subsequent to his death, Christian theologians and historians often cited \"Rabbi Azarias\" alongside such reputable authors as Maimonides and ibn Ezra, and translated several chapters of his work into Latin. De' Rossi's reputation among Jewish scholars was established in the nineteenth century when the pioneers of the _Wissenschaft des Judentums_ (Science of Judaism) hailed de' Rossi as the \"first true Jewish historian.\"\n\n### _Synagoga Iudaica: hoc est, Schola Iudaeorum in qua natiuitas, institutio, religio, vita, mors, sepulturaq\\[ue\\] ipsorum è libris eorundem; a M.

His goal in writing the book, however, was not to commend Jews for their faithfulness to Jewish law, but to criticize them for their departures from biblical law and practice. The Center for Advanced Judaic Studies library holds two different Latin translations of this work, but the more important of these was printed in Hanau in 1604, and reprinted in 1614 and 1624. This text was the one which made Buxtorf's impressive analysis available not only to the learned Christian world, but also to R.

For his grammar Bellarmine made ample use of Jean Cinqarbres' _Institutiones in Linguam Hebraicam_ (Paris, 1559). Later editions of Cinqarbres' grammar include also Bellarmine's _Exercitatio_ (Paris: 1582, 1609, and 1619).

She was born in Cologne, but in 1615 the family moved to Utrecht. She received an excellent education from the tutors hired to teach her brothers, and soon proved to be both a gifted visual artist and an accomplished Latin poet. By the early 1620's she had already become known as an excellent linguist and she developed a broad correspondence, receiving letters and poetry from scholars written in Hebrew, Latin, Greek, French and Dutch. She is reported to have been able to read Arabic, Aramaic, Syriac, Ethiopic, Turkish and Persian as well. Her teachers and friends were some of the best linguists in the Dutch Republic, including scholars such as Gispert Voetius, Andre Rivet, Friedrich Spannheim, and Joannes Beverovicius. She corresponded with Claude Saumaise, G. J. Vossius, and Daniel Heinsius, and theologians such as Voetius, Hornbeek, and Cloppenberg dedicated works to her. Her book, the _Opuscula_, edited by her friend Friedrich Spannheim, is a collection of her lesser writings, and appeared in three different printings. In 1653, at the height of her fame, she left the Netherlands and returned to Cologne to take care of family responsibilities. She then went into seclusion at a country estate, ceasing to answer her correspondents. In 1661, she became a follower and patroness of Jean de Labadie, once a Jesuit but by then a Protestant mystic who sought to create a new, purified Christian faith, a vision she too sought to fulfill until her death in 1678. Schurmann was able to gain entry into the rarefied world of the Republic of Letters because of her noble birth and her outstanding intellectual gifts, and as a result was able to become acquainted with the famous and learned university scholars who enjoyed such prominence in the learned world. She was one of the few female Christian Hebrew scholars in early modern Europe.\n\n### _Horæ hebraicæ et talmudicæ_\n\nJeffrey S.

He became Master of St. Catharine's Hall, Cambridge, in 1643, and Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University in 1654. As a member of Parliament, Lightfoot was entrusted with overseeing and administering a large purchase of texts in several Semitic languages for Cambridge in 1647-48. This volume contains the first two installments of a work that was published serially between 1658 and 1674. Drawing extensively on Talmudic literature, the writings of Josephus, and other classical sources, the first half offers a detailed geography of all the locations in the Land of Israel mentioned in the Gospels.

Much of his scholarly work was concerned with Hebrew linguistics and debates over the antiquity of the masoretic text of the Bible. Like his father, however, he also maintained an interest in post-biblical Judaism, and published a new edition of his father's summary of Jewish practice, _Synagoga Judaica_ (1661, repr. 1680.) The younger Buxtorf also developed a strong interest in Jewish theology, and early in his career, he published a new Latin translation of Maimonides' _Guide of the Perplexed_ (1629). One of his last works was this translation of Judah Halevi's anti-philosophical defense of Judaism, the _Book of the Kuzari_, based on Judah ibn Tibbon's Hebrew translation. The _Kuzari_, whose literary form was inspired by the eighth-century conversion of the Khazar people to Judaism, consists of an imagined dialogue between a rabbi and the Khazar king. Halevi's work was popular among Jewish scholars for its arguments for the reliability of the Jewish tradition, and for the superiority of the Jewish people, the land of Israel, and Hebrew. The book also contains extensive discussions of Jewish history, doctrine, and law; the Hebrew language; and various scientific issues. Making use of a sixteenth-century commentary by Judah Moscato, a Mantuan rabbi, as well as other Jewish authors, Buxtorf's extensive introduction discusses the Khazars, Halevi, as well as the content of the work. He also included Hebrew and Latin versions of letters between a later Khazar king and Hasdai ibn Shaprut (whose authenticity he doubted). One of Buxtorf's major goals was to make this work accessible to Christian scholars who desired knowledge of Jewish thought but were not themselves Hebraists. In addition to his own notes explaining the text, a citation index, and a detailed subject index, he appended relevant excerpts (in Latin translation) from works by various Jewish authors including Isaac Abravanel and Azariah de Rossi. Buxtorf's Liber Cosri made its way into numerous scholarly libraries in the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and was instrumental in bringing both Halevi's treatise and the story of the Khazar conversion to the attention of the Christian scholarly world. Buxtorf's work also did not go unnoticed by Jews: in late eighteenth-century Berlin, Moses Mendelssohn used the margins of this work to copy a commentary on the Kuzari by his teacher, Israel Zamosc.\n\n### _The present state of the Jews_\n\nHarvey Goldberg\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1675_Goldberg_Addison.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nLancelot Addison was an Anglican clergyman who was assigned to accompany English troops stationed on the Northern Coast of Morocco. There, he came into contact with local Jews, and utilized the experience to write about Jewish life. His _The Present State of the Jews (more particularly relating to those in Barbary)_ was published in the decades after Jews were formally permitted to resettle in England. It was reprinted several times, suggesting that the book attracted interest as a source of information on the Jews. A later publication of his on Islam identifies Addison as the author of _The Present State of the Jews_, further pointing to the recognition that the book achieved. A striking feature of the publication is its frontispiece, which depicts a \"native\" holding a banner proclaiming 'The Present State Of The Jews In Barbary'. No explanation is attatched to the illustration. Scholars have pointed out that part of Addison's book simply repeats material found in the English translation of Johannes Buxtorf's work, _The Jewish Synagogue, or an Historical Narration of the State of the Jewes_ (Synagoga Judaica, London, 1657). It is thus likely that when Addison did not have information from his own experience in North Africa, he \"cribbed\" from Buxtorf who recorded Jewish life in Central Europe. The title page also cites an annex to the book, a _Discourse of the Misna, Talmud and Gemara_.\n\n### _Kabbala denudata_\n\nAllison Coudert\n\n### [\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1677_kabbalah_denudata1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/kabbala-denudata?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1677_kabbalah_denudata2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/kabbala-denudata?item=1)\n\nThe _Kabbala denudata_ offered the Latin reading public selections from the most famous kabbalistic work, the _Zohar_, while providing other kabbalistic treatises and extensive commentaries to help the reader understand this notoriously difficult text. The editor and translator of the work, Christian Knorr von Rosenroth (1636-1689) was an accomplished Hebrew and Aramaic scholar, who considered the _Kabbalah_ the single most important source for recovering the ancient wisdom (_prisca sapientia_) that God imparted orally to Adam before the fall. This is the message of the frontispiece, which shows the _Kabbalah_ as a beautiful maiden running towards the palace of secret wisdom with the keys to both the Old and the New Testaments hanging from her wrist.\n\n### _Ceremonies et coustumes qui s'observent aujourd'huy parmy les juifs ..._\n\nGuy Stroumsa\n\n### [\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1682_Stroumsa_Modena1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/ceremonies-et-coustumes-qui-sobservent-aujourdhuy?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1682_Stroumsa_Modena2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/ceremonies-et-coustumes-qui-sobservent-aujourdhuy?item=1)\n\nLeone (Yehudah Arieh) Modena's _I riti degli Ebrei_..., written forthe King of England about 1617, and published in Paris (without its author's permission) in 1637 by the Christian Hebraist Jacques Gaffarel, is the first ethnographic description of Jewish customs written by a Jew in the modern times , with a Christian readership in mind. The _Riti_ were translated into various languages, and remained for a long time one of the msot important sources of knowledge about Judaism.

The book consists of a long list of Jewish Pseudo-Messiahs, beginning with Bar Khokhba, and including two chapters (pp. 76-102) on Sabbatai Zevi, chapters which are largely based on the earlier accounts of Paul Rycaut and Thomas Coenen. It ends with a short report of the Pseudo-Messiah Mordechai from Eisenstadt who appeared in 1682.

Lipmann traveled to other places in Bohemia and in the Rheinland as well. On several occasions he was involved in religious disputations, defending his faith and his community against Christian attacks. He is one of the first in medieval German Jewry to study philosophy and Kabbalah along with rabbinical scholarship. Although the author of many treatises - halakhic, liturgical, and hermeneutical - he is known to posterity mainly for his polemical _Sefer ha-Nitsahon_.\n\nThe book gained a wide circulation among Jewish readers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Forty-five manuscripts of the book survived - a very impressive number even by Christian standards. The work attracted Christian attention as well: Johann Pfefferkorn considered it to be the ultimate anti-Christian text and a major obstacle on the Jews' way to conversion. In the list of confiscated Hebrew books in Frankfurt for 1509, the municipal notary recorded a declaration the Jews had made concerning the _Sefer ha-Nitsahon_: _Kein haben wir davon_ (\"We have no copies of it\"). For many years Christian polemicists worked in vain to lay their hands on manuscripts of the book. In 1644, Theodor Hackspan, a professor of Hebrew at the University of Altdorf, succeeded in getting a copy, and he sat down a few of his Hebrew students to copy the book, and soon the _editio princeps_ came into being. The Hebrew knowledge of the scribes was far from perfect, and the edition is full of mistakes.\n\nSoon after becoming available, sections of the book were translated into Latin, and a full translation appeared in 1645. In 1674 Johann Christoph Wagenseil succeeded Hackspan as Professor of Languages in Altdorf, and during the same year he published his _Correctiones Lipmannianae_ according to two other manuscripts he managed to obtain. In his famous collection of Jewish polemical literature, the _Tela ignea Satanae_ ('Satan's Fiery Arrows'), Wagenseil included responses to the _Sefer ha-Nitsahon_ . Three Jewish editions appeared in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A critical edition is in preparation by Ora Limor and Israel Yuval.\n\nAccording to the title and to the information given in the translator's introduction, the manuscript here on display contains a Spanish translation of _Sefer ha-Nitsahon_ by R. Yom-Tov Lipmann Mühlhausen. The translation was made by the cantor David Prado in London, in 1695. In fact the manuscript contains two different works, neither of them being Lipmann's _Nitsahon_. The first is the _Nitsahon Vetus_, i.e. the older Nitsahon, an anthology of Jewish Ashkenazic anti-Christian polemic, probably written in Germany at the end of the 13th century, with several additions (some of which may have been derived from Lipman's _Nitsahon_). The order of chapters does not always correspond to the known versions of the _Nitsahon Vetus_. It is impossible to tell whether the changes were made by the translator himself. It is also hard to tell why he ascribed the _Nitsahon Vetus_ to Lipmann M|hlhausen, but it would seem that the confusion between these two works was quite common.\n\nThe second work in this manuscript, also translated by Prado, is the _Sefer Toledoth Yeshu_, a Jewish counter-biography of Jesus, which was very popular among Jews in Early Modern and in Modern Europe.\n\n### _Reasons for naturalizing the Jews in Great Britain and Ireland_\n\nJonathan Karp\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1714_Karp_Toland.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nJohn Toland (1670-1722), Deist philosopher and political writer,was born a Catholic in Londonderry and converted to Protestantism at the age of 16. His embrace of religious toleration, in tension with his powerful animus toward Catholicism, underlay Toland's 1714 pamphlet advocating the naturalization of foreign-born Jews in Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nHistorians have traditionally viewed Toland's _Reasons_ as a \"harbinger\" of later Jewish emancipatory ideology. But the work is best seen as a Philo-Judaic tract promoting the author's scheme to employ Jewish colonists as a political and military wedge against Catholic Jacobite insurrection. Jewish naturalization and colonization were in line with Toland's depiction of contemporary Jews as inheritors of the civic and military virtues embedded in the ancient \"Respublica Mosaica,\" a model of ancient constitutionalism marked by natural law and religious freedom for non-Jews (outlined in greater detail in Toland's 1718 _Nazarenus or Jewish, Gentile and Mohametan Christianity_). Toland produced his _Reasons_ at a moment (the Autumn of 1714) when Whigs had grown euphoric over the recent succession to the British Crown of the Protestant Hanoverians, placing theTory Party on the defensive and offering - or so Toland believed - a unique opportunity for expanded religious freedom. While Toland's _Reasons_ exerted no immediate impact on the status of Jews in Britain, it can be viewed as marking a high point in the intellectual history of a genuine Philo-Semitism, one premised on the presumed historical virtues of Jews and Judaism while eschewing all Christian missionary intent.\n\n### _Jüdisches Ceremoniel, oder, Beschreibung dererjenigen Gebräuche_\n\nYaakov Deutsch\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1724_Deutsch_Kirchner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis book is an example of a specific genre in the writings of Christian Hebraists, which includes works that describe the customs, ceremonies and rituals of contemporary Jews. Like many writers of these books, Kirchner was a convert. Beside this book he published a work in 1719 that was aimed to help with the conversion of the Jews, entitled _Lehar'ot or emet la-yehudim_. The _Jüdisches Ceremoniel_ was originally published in 1717 and later on was revised and enlarged by Sebastian Jacob Jungendres (1684-1765). According to Jungendres the original work by Kirchner was inaccurate and biased because he wanted to prove the evilness of the Jews. Another addition to this imprint are 27 engravings that portray various customs and ceremonies held by the Jews. The book was published at least eleven times between 1717 and 1734, including a Dutch translation, and was reprinted in 1974 by Olms and in 1999 by the Reprint-Verlag, Leipzig. \n\n### _Joannis Seldeni jurisconsulti Opera omnia, tam edita quam inedita_\n\nJason Rosenblatt\n\n### \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1726_selden.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nJohn Selden (1584-1654), the most learned person in England in the seventeenth century, was a lawyer, an antiquarian, a member of Parliament,and the greatest expert of his day on British legal matters. A polymath, he also wrote a half dozen rabbinic works, some of them immense, which respect, to an an extent remarkable for the times, the self-understanding of Judaic exegesis. _De Diis Syris_ (1617), an analysis of the pagan gods of the Hebrew Bible, constitutes a pioneering study of cultural anthropology and comparative religion. Its literary influence extends to the work of Ben Jonson and to the list of pagan gods in John Milton's _Nativity Ode_ and Book 1 of _Paradise Lost. De Successionibus_ (1631) addresses the question of intestate succession according to Jewish law. _De Successione in Pontificum Ebraeorum_ (1638) explores the laws relating to the ancient Jewish priesthood. _Uxor Ebraica_ (1646) analyzes the theory and practice of the Jewish laws of marriage and divorce, which Selden admired. On the very last page he suggests parenthetically (because he loved to bury the lead) that the canon law of divorce still in force in England be reformed and brought more closely into conformity with Jewish law. Selden's motto was \"Above all things, liberty,\" and _De Synedriis Veterum Ebraeorum_ (1650-53), a study of the Sanhedrin written shortly after the execution of Charles I, contains a remarkable Maimonidean discussion of whether that court could try kings not only for crimes like murder that anyone could commit but also for those which only kings could commit. Occupying 1,132 huge folio columns in the _Opera_, _De Synedriis_ deals primarily with the constitution of Jewish courts, including the Sanhedrin, which, as Selden notes pointedly,was not priestly in composition. Its understated argument is thoroughy Erastian, demonstrating that matters at present under the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts in England were in ancient times decided by Jewish courts that could well be called secular. _De Jure Naturali et Gentium_ (1640), surely one of the most genuinely philosemitic works produced by a Christian Hebraist in early modern Europe. Selden accepts the universal validity of the _praecepta Noachidarum_, the seven Noachide laws, which for him constitute the law of nature. Selden bases his theory on the Talmud, which for him records a set of doctrines far older than classical antiquity. Natural law consists not of innate rational principles that are intuitively obvious but rather specific divine pronouncements uttered by God at a point in historical time. Selden discusses the rabbinicidentification of natural law with the divinely pronounced Adamic and Noachide laws, considered by rabbinic tradition as the minimal moral duties enjoined upon all of humankind. While he accepts the authority of this non-biblically rabbinic law, he dismisses the biblical ten commandmentsas of purely Jewish interest. Readers of every stripe made amazingly different uses of Selden's scholarship in _De Jure_, which looks back to Grotius and forward to Hobbes, and influences readers as different as Isaac Newton, the zealously antiprelatical Independent Henry Burton (one of the Tower-Hill martyrs shorn of his ears by Archbishop Laud), the Presbyterian John Lightfoot (himself a Hebraist, he called \"the great Mr. Selden the Learnest man upon the earth\"), the proto-deist John Toland, and Bishop Stillingfleet. The last volume of the _Opera_ contains Selden's work in English, including his famous _Table-Talk_. According to David Ogg, Selden sought \"not fame but truth in an erudition more vast than was ever garnered by any other human mind.\"\n\n### _Algemeine Welt-Historie von Anbeginn der Welt bis auf gegenwfrtige Zeit (Universal history, from the earliest account of time)_\n\nNils Roemer\n\n### [\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1744_universal_account1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/algemeine-welt-historie-von-anbeginn-der-welt-bis-auf?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1744_universal_account2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/algemeine-welt-historie-von-anbeginn-der-welt-bis-auf?item=1)\n\nThe _Algemeine Welthistorie_, published by the theologians and historians Siegmund Baumgarten and Johann Semler in Halle between 1744 and 1765, provides an elaborate account of Jewish history from antiquity to the end of the seventh century. This encyclopedic and multi-volume universal history represents a truly unique moment in the development of modern historiography, since before the rise of modern historicism, historic accounts of the world restricted the Jewish past to the Biblical period.\n\n### _La Bible enfin expliquée par plusieurs aumôniers de S.

He repeatedly returns in his extremely prolific writings to a cluster of favorite themes: the absurdity and immorality of the Old Testament and the primitivism, historical insignificance and arrogance of the Jewish people. Although his aphoristic style of writing contrasts markedly with the cautious erudition of Christian Hebraism, his anti-Judaic polemics were nonetheless to a large extent based on his own engagement with, and critique of, this tradition. In _La Bible enfin expliquée_ (1776) - one of his last major works - Voltaire put forward his most systematic satire of both Christian and Jewish biblical exegesis. His title is manifestly ironic: his concern is not to 'explain' the Bible, but systematically to expose its absurdities, contradictions and ethical shortcomings. Focusing almost exclusively on the Pentateuch, he seldom misses an opportunity to highlight instances of Jewish barbarism or hypocrisy. These textual attacks are at times explicitly broadened out to apply to Jews of all eras: 'still in our times', he writes, 'the people of this nation are extremely dirty and stinking.'\n\nThis text is perhaps the most rhetorically powerful statement of the repudiation of Hebraist scholarship by the philosophes of the High Enlightenment. Voltaire and his allies regarded rabbinic literature as the very quintessence of obscurantism and pedantry, and as such the defining polar opposite of their own self-consciously engaged intellectual values.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Burnett, Stephen G.** _From Christian Hebraism to Jewish Studies: Johannes Buxtorf (1564-1629) and Hebrew Learning in the Seventeenth-Century_.

Intellectual and cultural exchange did occur between Jew and Christian during the Middle Ages, but paled by comparison with what occurred between 1450 and 1750. Encounters between cultures can be fruitful, but also very painful. Certainly Christian Hebraism had such effects both upon European Jewry, and upon western tradition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the most tangible witnesses to the sudden and sustained popularity of Hebraica and Judaica among Christian writers and readers during this period are books. In addition to our discussions throughout the year and the final conference, we fellows would like to share some of the books that we found most intriguing or most useful in our research. Participating fellows have each chosen a book, written a short description of it and picked an illustration to go with it. Each of these books may be found in the library of the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies or at Van Pelt Library, the main library of the University of Pennsylvania. The understanding of Judaism held by the authors of these works is not always entirely accurate, and frequently they were involved in controversies that either baffle or infuriate contemporary readers, yet some of their work has stood the test of time. Christian Hebraism in its day mediated Jewish thought to the majority of western thinkers who could not read Hebrew and contributed to the emergence of several modern scholarly disciplines including cultural anthropology, comparative religion, and Jewish studies. This encounter with Judaism paradoxically served both to confirm traditional religious beliefs in some readers, while for others it fostered the skepticism, irreligion, and toleration normally associated with the Enlightenment. While Judaism’s claim to be one of the three pillars of Western Civilization, together with Greek and Roman culture, rests primarily on the importance of the Hebrew Bible, Christian Hebraists in early modern Europe made their contribution by enriching western thought with a healthy dose of Jewish education.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: right\">\u003Cstrong>Stephen Burnett\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"index-by-author-of-collection-item\">\u003Cstrong>Index by author of collection item\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065216im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/logo_froben.jpg\" alt=\"Unidentified drawing (possibly a colophon) showing a caduceus supported by 2 hands.\" class=\"align-left\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lancelot Addison, 1632-1703.

During his long and very active life, Llull continuously refined the Art and used it in polemic against Jews and Muslims to bring about their conversion. \u003Cem>The Book of the Gentile\u003C/em>, written between 1274-76 in Catalan and translated very rapidly into Latin, French and Spanish, portrays a cordial disputation between a Jew, Christian and Muslim for the edification of a Gentile utilising the framework of the \u003Cem>Art\u003C/em>. In the work, a large measure of tolerance is shown toward the other, and Llull reveals remarkable knowledge of contemporary Judaism and Islam. The last redaction of the framework of the \u003Cem>Art\u003C/em> was the \u003Cem>Ars generalis ultima\u003C/em> completed in 1308 along with the very popular \u003Cem>Ars brevis\u003C/em>.

He amassed a large collection of manuscripts (now in the Munich Staatsbibliothek) and although he died after the first three volumes appeared, the work was continued by the new editor Philip Wolff.

He believed that these sources hide old traditions which prove the main tenets of Christianity and which should be extracted from the Jewish books “like pearls from a dunghill.” His method was to bring the Jewish section in its Hebrew or Aramaic original, followed by a Latin translation and a commentary. Raymundus’ aim was not to refute Jewish sources or to annihilate Jewish books, but to use them for Christian purposes.

Its six volumes were printed between 1514 and 1517, but difficulty in obtaining papal approval delayed official publication until 1521.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first four volumes of this \u003Cem>Biblia Polyglotta\u003C/em> contain the Hebrew Bible, volume 5 contains the Greek New Testament, and volume 6 contains various indices and study guides (including a Hebrew-Aramaic dictionary and a Hebrew grammar). The first page reproduced here is Genesis Chapter 1. Jerome’s Vulgate translation is in the center of the page, between the Hebrew text on the right (with roots printed in the margin) and the Greek Septuagint (with an interlinear Latin translation) on the left. The Aramaic translation is found on the bottom left of the page, with its Latin translation to the right, and its roots printed in the margin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The second page reproduced here provides an illuminating example of how the Complutensian Polyglot was used by Christian Hebraists in Early Modern England. The bottom of this page displays verses 1-10 from Proverbs: Chapter 6, and includes the Latin text in the center, with the Hebrew text on the right and the Greek text on the left. John Donne, one of the most famous preachers of his time, discusses these verses in a sermon given in 1621 (Sermons, Volume III: pp. 231-232): “In the sixth Chapter of this booke, when Solomon had sent us to the Ant, to learne wisedome, betweene the eight verse and the ninth, he sends us to another schoole, to the Bee: \u003Cem>Vade ad Apem &#x26; disce quomodo operationem venerabilem facit\u003C/em>, ‘Goe to the Bee, and learne how reverend and mysterious a worke she works.’ For, though S. Hierome acknowledge, that in his time, this verse was not in the Hebrew text, yet it hath ever been in many Copies of the Septuagint, and though it be now left out in the Complutense Bible, and that which they call the \u003Cem>Kings\u003C/em> [Antwerp Polyglot], yet it is in that still, which they value above all, the Vatican.” What is important here is Donne’s need to establish the source and authority for his reading of the Bible in a comparison of the Hebrew, Greek and Latin textual versions. To do so, he makes use of the Complutensian [as well as the Antwerp] Polyglot to establish the original integrity and meaning of the Hebrew text, further spotlighting the problems of variant Greek and Latin translations. In this manner the Polyglot Bibles served the Protestant preacher in his study of the various biblical texts and interpretive traditions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"psalterium-hebreum-grecum-arabicum--chaldeum-cum-tribus-latinus-interpretationibus--glossis\">\u003Cem>Psalterium, Hebreum, Grecum, Arabicum, &#x26; Chaldeum, cum tribus Latinus interpretationibus &#x26; glossis\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Seth Jerchower\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-5\">\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/psalterium-hebreum-grecum-arabicum-chaldeum-cum-tribus?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1516_genoa.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/psalterium-hebreum-grecum-arabicum-chaldeum-cum-tribus?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1516_genoaa.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/psalterium-hebreum-grecum-arabicum-chaldeum-cum-tribus?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1516_genoab.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While the \u003Cem>Complutensian Bible\u003C/em> may have been the first polyglot to come off the printing press (commencing with the New Testament in 1514) it was not the first to be published.

The first of Levitas books to be translated into Latin, in this case by Sebastian Münster, appeared in this Basel 1525 printing. Münster, Paul Fagius, and Johannes Campensis edited or translated a number of Levitas works, printing them in Basel, Paris, Isny, Cracow, and Louvain. At least 26 more printings of Levitas books, either in Latin or as diglot texts with both the Hebrew original and Latin translation, would appear in print between 1525 and 1610, quite apart from the numerous printings of his works in Hebrew alone, intended for Jewish readers.

In 1570, the \u003Cem>Catechism\u003C/em> appeared for the first time in a polyglot form which included not only the original German, but Hebrew, Greek, and Latin translations of the text in parallel columns. This new edition was ideally suited to language instruction in schools since it included familiar texts in the less familiar biblical languages. While the text of the Ten Commandments could be copied from the Hebrew Bible, most of the catechism had to be translated into Hebrew for the first time. The copy held by the Center for Judaic Studies library is a good representative of this work in that it was printed at Wittenberg by the heirs of Johannes Krafft (\u003Cem>Crato\u003C/em>), a fairly successful Hebrew printer for the Protestant market. This firm produced 16 of the 25 printings of the polyglot catechism which appeared between 1570 and 1650, all except one of which were printed in Wittenberg.

To counter this, the Aragonese rabbi Isaac ben Moses Arama (ca. 1420-1494) composed his own homilies and delivered them to the Jewish community. These homilies consisted of a philosophical defense of Judaism: the appeal of reason over the terrors of the establishment. Later, Arama collected and reorganized these sermons as his magnum opus, the \u003Cem>`Akedat Yitshak\u003C/em>. The title, which translates as \u003Cem>The Binding of Isaac\u003C/em>, is a fitting one, for indeed Arama masterfully binds the traditions and methods of midrashic exposition with those of philosophical demonstration. The \u003Cem>‘Akedah\u003C/em> rapidly gained favor among a Jewish readership whose demography was ironically expanded by the events of 1492. It would also gain notoriety within Christian circles, where it was perceived as a slanderous work against Christendom, its dogmas and its institutions. Like many other Jewish works, particularly core ones such as the Talmud, lexica, commentaries, and entire sections of liturgy, it was liable to censorship.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Censorship as an official institution was a response to both the success of the printing press and the [arguably subsequent] threat of Protestantism. A first decree prescribing universal censorship was proclaimed in 1487 in a Bull issued by Innocent VIII. In 1516 a Bull by Leo X instituted the \u003Cem>imprimatur\u003C/em>, the pre-publication approbation. Universal enforcement would not occur, however, until the 1540’s, after two events that sanctioned its implementation: the relegation of all censorship matters to the General Inquisition in 1542 by Paul III, and the recommendation of the Council of Trent in 1546 for a more active enforcement. What followed, \u003Cem>inter alia\u003C/em>, was the \u003Cem>Index librorum prohibitorum\u003C/em> [\u003Cem>Index of Prohibited Books\u003C/em>], an en masse confiscation and “correction” of alleged illicit writings, Paul IV’s infamous Bull \u003Cem>Cum nimis absurdum\u003C/em>, and the burning of books, not least of which was the Talmud. In 1554 Julius III decreed that any Hebrew book not bearing the \u003Cem>imprimatur\u003C/em> fell subject to confiscation if it was deemed derogatory to Christianity. The book was given to a censor (often an apostate, who brought with him his knowledge of Hebrew; there is also evidence that faithful Jews played an ancillary role, possibly as an endeavour to save Jewish texts from obliteration) who would proceed to blot out the offensive passages. The final step was the placement of a “censor’s mark,” usually consisting of a signature, date, and brief declaration of examination. Despite an explicit provision in Julius III’s Bull, the books were typically not returned to their owners, but kept sequestered in church or convent libraries. Curiously, the same censors’ names today recur in Judaica collections throughout the world, yet represent a relatively brief albeit intense period of activity restricted to a relatively minimal area: the Papal State and the Savoy. After having occupied northern Italy (1796-98), Napoleon shut down the convents and monasteries of these regions, leading to an abandonment of the libraries, and a sudden boom for collectors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"thesaurus-linguae-sanctae\">\u003Cem>Thesaurus linguae sanctae\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Seth Jerchower\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-9\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/stephanus_grammar1548.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Pagnini, whose initial formation began under the tutelage of Girolamo Savonarola in Florence, is the likely emblematic albeit arcane figure of post-laurentian Christian Hebraism in Italy.

His book Jewish Synagogue (Juden Schul, Basel, 1603) as one of the first serious attempts by a Christian scholar to portray traditional Judaism in a realistic way, explaining the laws governing Jewish life from cradle to grave, the Jewish week and the Jewish religious calendar using quotations from Joseph Karo’s Shulhan Aruk and Judeo-German popular works to back up his assertions. His goal in writing the book, however, was not to commend Jews for their faithfulness to Jewish law, but to criticize them for their departures from biblical law and practice. The Center for Advanced Judaic Studies library holds two different Latin translations of this work, but the more important of these was printed in Hanau in 1604, and reprinted in 1614 and 1624. This text was the one which made Buxtorf’s impressive analysis available not only to the learned Christian world, but also to R.

She was born in Cologne, but in 1615 the family moved to Utrecht. She received an excellent education from the tutors hired to teach her brothers, and soon proved to be both a gifted visual artist and an accomplished Latin poet. By the early 1620’s she had already become known as an excellent linguist and she developed a broad correspondence, receiving letters and poetry from scholars written in Hebrew, Latin, Greek, French and Dutch. She is reported to have been able to read Arabic, Aramaic, Syriac, Ethiopic, Turkish and Persian as well. Her teachers and friends were some of the best linguists in the Dutch Republic, including scholars such as Gispert Voetius, Andre Rivet, Friedrich Spannheim, and Joannes Beverovicius. She corresponded with Claude Saumaise, G. J. Vossius, and Daniel Heinsius, and theologians such as Voetius, Hornbeek, and Cloppenberg dedicated works to her. Her book, the \u003Cem>Opuscula\u003C/em>, edited by her friend Friedrich Spannheim, is a collection of her lesser writings, and appeared in three different printings. In 1653, at the height of her fame, she left the Netherlands and returned to Cologne to take care of family responsibilities. She then went into seclusion at a country estate, ceasing to answer her correspondents. In 1661, she became a follower and patroness of Jean de Labadie, once a Jesuit but by then a Protestant mystic who sought to create a new, purified Christian faith, a vision she too sought to fulfill until her death in 1678. Schurmann was able to gain entry into the rarefied world of the Republic of Letters because of her noble birth and her outstanding intellectual gifts, and as a result was able to become acquainted with the famous and learned university scholars who enjoyed such prominence in the learned world.

Much of his scholarly work was concerned with Hebrew linguistics and debates over the antiquity of the masoretic text of the Bible. Like his father, however, he also maintained an interest in post-biblical Judaism, and published a new edition of his father’s summary of Jewish practice, \u003Cem>Synagoga Judaica\u003C/em> (1661, repr. 1680.) The younger Buxtorf also developed a strong interest in Jewish theology, and early in his career, he published a new Latin translation of Maimonides’ \u003Cem>Guide of the Perplexed\u003C/em> (1629). One of his last works was this translation of Judah Halevi’s anti-philosophical defense of Judaism, the \u003Cem>Book of the Kuzari\u003C/em>, based on Judah ibn Tibbon’s Hebrew translation. The \u003Cem>Kuzari\u003C/em>, whose literary form was inspired by the eighth-century conversion of the Khazar people to Judaism, consists of an imagined dialogue between a rabbi and the Khazar king. Halevi’s work was popular among Jewish scholars for its arguments for the reliability of the Jewish tradition, and for the superiority of the Jewish people, the land of Israel, and Hebrew. The book also contains extensive discussions of Jewish history, doctrine, and law; the Hebrew language; and various scientific issues. Making use of a sixteenth-century commentary by Judah Moscato, a Mantuan rabbi, as well as other Jewish authors, Buxtorf’s extensive introduction discusses the Khazars, Halevi, as well as the content of the work. He also included Hebrew and Latin versions of letters between a later Khazar king and Hasdai ibn Shaprut (whose authenticity he doubted). One of Buxtorf’s major goals was to make this work accessible to Christian scholars who desired knowledge of Jewish thought but were not themselves Hebraists. In addition to his own notes explaining the text, a citation index, and a detailed subject index, he appended relevant excerpts (in Latin translation) from works by various Jewish authors including Isaac Abravanel and Azariah de Rossi. Buxtorf’s Liber Cosri made its way into numerous scholarly libraries in the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and was instrumental in bringing both Halevi’s treatise and the story of the Khazar conversion to the attention of the Christian scholarly world. Buxtorf’s work also did not go unnoticed by Jews: in late eighteenth-century Berlin, Moses Mendelssohn used the margins of this work to copy a commentary on the Kuzari by his teacher, Israel Zamosc.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-present-state-of-the-jews\">\u003Cem>The present state of the Jews\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Harvey Goldberg\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-14\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1675_Goldberg_Addison.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Lancelot Addison was an Anglican clergyman who was assigned to accompany English troops stationed on the Northern Coast of Morocco. There, he came into contact with local Jews, and utilized the experience to write about Jewish life. His \u003Cem>The Present State of the Jews (more particularly relating to those in Barbary)\u003C/em> was published in the decades after Jews were formally permitted to resettle in England. It was reprinted several times, suggesting that the book attracted interest as a source of information on the Jews. A later publication of his on Islam identifies Addison as the author of \u003Cem>The Present State of the Jews\u003C/em>, further pointing to the recognition that the book achieved. A striking feature of the publication is its frontispiece, which depicts a “native” holding a banner proclaiming ‘The Present State Of The Jews In Barbary’. No explanation is attatched to the illustration. Scholars have pointed out that part of Addison’s book simply repeats material found in the English translation of Johannes Buxtorf’s work, \u003Cem>The Jewish Synagogue, or an Historical Narration of the State of the Jewes\u003C/em> (Synagoga Judaica, London, 1657). It is thus likely that when Addison did not have information from his own experience in North Africa, he “cribbed” from Buxtorf who recorded Jewish life in Central Europe.

In 1674 Johann Christoph Wagenseil succeeded Hackspan as Professor of Languages in Altdorf, and during the same year he published his \u003Cem>Correctiones Lipmannianae\u003C/em> according to two other manuscripts he managed to obtain. In his famous collection of Jewish polemical literature, the \u003Cem>Tela ignea Satanae\u003C/em> (‘Satan’s Fiery Arrows’), Wagenseil included responses to the \u003Cem>Sefer ha-Nitsahon\u003C/em> . Three Jewish editions appeared in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A critical edition is in preparation by Ora Limor and Israel Yuval.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>According to the title and to the information given in the translator’s introduction, the manuscript here on display contains a Spanish translation of \u003Cem>Sefer ha-Nitsahon\u003C/em> by R. Yom-Tov Lipmann Mühlhausen. The translation was made by the cantor David Prado in London, in 1695. In fact the manuscript contains two different works, neither of them being Lipmann’s \u003Cem>Nitsahon\u003C/em>. The first is the \u003Cem>Nitsahon Vetus\u003C/em>, i.e. the older Nitsahon, an anthology of Jewish Ashkenazic anti-Christian polemic, probably written in Germany at the end of the 13th century, with several additions (some of which may have been derived from Lipman’s \u003Cem>Nitsahon\u003C/em>). The order of chapters does not always correspond to the known versions of the \u003Cem>Nitsahon Vetus\u003C/em>. It is impossible to tell whether the changes were made by the translator himself. It is also hard to tell why he ascribed the \u003Cem>Nitsahon Vetus\u003C/em> to Lipmann M|hlhausen, but it would seem that the confusion between these two works was quite common.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The second work in this manuscript, also translated by Prado, is the \u003Cem>Sefer Toledoth Yeshu\u003C/em>, a Jewish counter-biography of Jesus, which was very popular among Jews in Early Modern and in Modern Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"reasons-for-naturalizing-the-jews-in-great-britain-and-ireland\">\u003Cem>Reasons for naturalizing the Jews in Great Britain and Ireland\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jonathan Karp\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-19\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1714_Karp_Toland.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>John Toland (1670-1722), Deist philosopher and political writer,was born a Catholic in Londonderry and converted to Protestantism at the age of 16. His embrace of religious toleration, in tension with his powerful animus toward Catholicism, underlay Toland’s 1714 pamphlet advocating the naturalization of foreign-born Jews in Great Britain and Ireland.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Historians have traditionally viewed Toland’s \u003Cem>Reasons\u003C/em> as a “harbinger” of later Jewish emancipatory ideology. But the work is best seen as a Philo-Judaic tract promoting the author’s scheme to employ Jewish colonists as a political and military wedge against Catholic Jacobite insurrection. Jewish naturalization and colonization were in line with Toland’s depiction of contemporary Jews as inheritors of the civic and military virtues embedded in the ancient “Respublica Mosaica,” a model of ancient constitutionalism marked by natural law and religious freedom for non-Jews (outlined in greater detail in Toland’s 1718 \u003Cem>Nazarenus or Jewish, Gentile and Mohametan Christianity\u003C/em>). Toland produced his \u003Cem>Reasons\u003C/em> at a moment (the Autumn of 1714) when Whigs had grown euphoric over the recent succession to the British Crown of the Protestant Hanoverians, placing theTory Party on the defensive and offering - or so Toland believed - a unique opportunity for expanded religious freedom. While Toland’s \u003Cem>Reasons\u003C/em> exerted no immediate impact on the status of Jews in Britain, it can be viewed as marking a high point in the intellectual history of a genuine Philo-Semitism, one premised on the presumed historical virtues of Jews and Judaism while eschewing all Christian missionary intent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"jüdisches-ceremoniel-oder-beschreibung-dererjenigen-gebräuche\">\u003Cem>Jüdisches Ceremoniel, oder, Beschreibung dererjenigen Gebräuche\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Yaakov Deutsch\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-20\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1724_Deutsch_Kirchner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This book is an example of a specific genre in the writings of Christian Hebraists, which includes works that describe the customs, ceremonies and rituals of contemporary Jews. Like many writers of these books, Kirchner was a convert. Beside this book he published a work in 1719 that was aimed to help with the conversion of the Jews, entitled \u003Cem>Lehar’ot or emet la-yehudim\u003C/em>. The \u003Cem>Jüdisches Ceremoniel\u003C/em> was originally published in 1717 and later on was revised and enlarged by Sebastian Jacob Jungendres (1684-1765). According to Jungendres the original work by Kirchner was inaccurate and biased because he wanted to prove the evilness of the Jews. Another addition to this imprint are 27 engravings that portray various customs and ceremonies held by the Jews. The book was published at least eleven times between 1717 and 1734, including a Dutch translation, and was reprinted in 1974 by Olms and in 1999 by the Reprint-Verlag, Leipzig. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"joannis-seldeni-jurisconsulti-opera-omnia-tam-edita-quam-inedita\">\u003Cem>Joannis Seldeni jurisconsulti Opera omnia, tam edita quam inedita\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jason Rosenblatt\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-21\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1726_selden.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>John Selden (1584-1654), the most learned person in England in the seventeenth century, was a lawyer, an antiquarian, a member of Parliament,and the greatest expert of his day on British legal matters. A polymath, he also wrote a half dozen rabbinic works, some of them immense, which respect, to an an extent remarkable for the times, the self-understanding of Judaic exegesis. \u003Cem>De Diis Syris\u003C/em> (1617), an analysis of the pagan gods of the Hebrew Bible, constitutes a pioneering study of cultural anthropology and comparative religion. Its literary influence extends to the work of Ben Jonson and to the list of pagan gods in John Milton’s \u003Cem>Nativity Ode\u003C/em> and Book 1 of \u003Cem>Paradise Lost. De Successionibus\u003C/em> (1631) addresses the question of intestate succession according to Jewish law. \u003Cem>De Successione in Pontificum Ebraeorum\u003C/em> (1638) explores the laws relating to the ancient Jewish priesthood. \u003Cem>Uxor Ebraica\u003C/em> (1646) analyzes the theory and practice of the Jewish laws of marriage and divorce, which Selden admired. On the very last page he suggests parenthetically (because he loved to bury the lead) that the canon law of divorce still in force in England be reformed and brought more closely into conformity with Jewish law. Selden’s motto was “Above all things, liberty,” and \u003Cem>De Synedriis Veterum Ebraeorum\u003C/em> (1650-53), a study of the Sanhedrin written shortly after the execution of Charles I, contains a remarkable Maimonidean discussion of whether that court could try kings not only for crimes like murder that anyone could commit but also for those which only kings could commit. Occupying 1,132 huge folio columns in the \u003Cem>Opera\u003C/em>, \u003Cem>De Synedriis\u003C/em> deals primarily with the constitution of Jewish courts, including the Sanhedrin, which, as Selden notes pointedly,was not priestly in composition. Its understated argument is thoroughy Erastian, demonstrating that matters at present under the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts in England were in ancient times decided by Jewish courts that could well be called secular. \u003Cem>De Jure Naturali et Gentium\u003C/em> (1640), surely one of the most genuinely philosemitic works produced by a Christian Hebraist in early modern Europe. Selden accepts the universal validity of the \u003Cem>praecepta Noachidarum\u003C/em>, the seven Noachide laws, which for him constitute the law of nature. Selden bases his theory on the Talmud, which for him records a set of doctrines far older than classical antiquity. Natural law consists not of innate rational principles that are intuitively obvious but rather specific divine pronouncements uttered by God at a point in historical time. Selden discusses the rabbinicidentification of natural law with the divinely pronounced Adamic and Noachide laws, considered by rabbinic tradition as the minimal moral duties enjoined upon all of humankind. While he accepts the authority of this non-biblically rabbinic law, he dismisses the biblical ten commandmentsas of purely Jewish interest. Readers of every stripe made amazingly different uses of Selden’s scholarship in \u003Cem>De Jure\u003C/em>, which looks back to Grotius and forward to Hobbes, and influences readers as different as Isaac Newton, the zealously antiprelatical Independent Henry Burton (one of the Tower-Hill martyrs shorn of his ears by Archbishop Laud), the Presbyterian John Lightfoot (himself a Hebraist, he called “the great Mr. Selden the Learnest man upon the earth”), the proto-deist John Toland, and Bishop Stillingfleet. The last volume of the \u003Cem>Opera\u003C/em> contains Selden’s work in English, including his famous \u003Cem>Table-Talk\u003C/em>. According to David Ogg, Selden sought “not fame but truth in an erudition more vast than was ever garnered by any other human mind.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"algemeine-welt-historie-von-anbeginn-der-welt-bis-auf-gegenwfrtige-zeit-universal-history-from-the-earliest-account-of-time\">\u003Cem>Algemeine Welt-Historie von Anbeginn der Welt bis auf gegenwfrtige Zeit (Universal history, from the earliest account of time)\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Nils Roemer\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"-22\">\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/algemeine-welt-historie-von-anbeginn-der-welt-bis-auf?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1744_universal_account1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/hebraica-veritas/algemeine-welt-historie-von-anbeginn-der-welt-bis-auf?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929065832im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/1744_universal_account2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cem>Algemeine Welthistorie\u003C/em>, published by the theologians and historians Siegmund Baumgarten and Johann Semler in Halle between 1744 and 1765, provides an elaborate account of Jewish history from antiquity to the end of the seventh century.

He repeatedly returns in his extremely prolific writings to a cluster of favorite themes: the absurdity and immorality of the Old Testament and the primitivism, historical insignificance and arrogance of the Jewish people. Although his aphoristic style of writing contrasts markedly with the cautious erudition of Christian Hebraism, his anti-Judaic polemics were nonetheless to a large extent based on his own engagement with, and critique of, this tradition. In \u003Cem>La Bible enfin expliquée\u003C/em> (1776) - one of his last major works - Voltaire put forward his most systematic satire of both Christian and Jewish biblical exegesis. His title is manifestly ironic: his concern is not to ‘explain’ the Bible, but systematically to expose its absurdities, contradictions and ethical shortcomings. Focusing almost exclusively on the Pentateuch, he seldom misses an opportunity to highlight instances of Jewish barbarism or hypocrisy. These textual attacks are at times explicitly broadened out to apply to Jews of all eras: ‘still in our times’, he writes, ‘the people of this nation are extremely dirty and stinking.’\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This text is perhaps the most rhetorically powerful statement of the repudiation of Hebraist scholarship by the philosophes of the High Enlightenment. Voltaire and his allies regarded rabbinic literature as the very quintessence of obscurantism and pedantry, and as such the defining polar opposite of their own self-consciously engaged intellectual values.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Burnett, Stephen G.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>From Christian Hebraism to Jewish Studies: Johannes Buxtorf (1564-1629) and Hebrew Learning in the Seventeenth-Century\u003C/em>.

Instead of a year on the rabbis and their world, we have focused instead on the imperial context of which Judaism was but one small piece. How does this perspective change the sort of evidence and questions we bring to this era of seminal transformation in Jewish culture, law, society, art, and practice? The idea has been to foster vibrant reciprocity. Scholars of early Judaism need to be regularly challenged by the data and complexity of Roman history, even, and especially, as Rome became a Christian empire. The group has also pushed Roman history to better take the measure of the vast, but often inaccessible, evidence of one of its own (uniquely vocal) provincial populations - the Jews. The conversation has been extraordinary, and is reechoed in the diversity and range of the fellows convened, several of whom are represented in this exhibit. I hope you enjoy it, and get at least some taste of what has been an extraordinary year. I want to extend my sincere thanks to David Ruderman and the Center for supporting the year, to Arthur Kiron for curating this exhibit, to Greg Bear for the title graphic, to Leslie Vallhonrat for designing the on-line version of the exhibit, and especially to Ra'anan Boustan, Oded Irshai, and Seth Schwartz. These remarkable and generous scholars, through many hours of conversation, came up with the call for this year and were essential in fulfilling its mission.\n\n**Natalie Dohrmann**\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### Jerome's translation of the second book of the Chronicon of Eusebius of Caesarea\n\nWilliam Adler\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/eusebius2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nFeatured here are sample pages from Jerome's translation of the second book of the Chronicon of Eusebius of Caesarea (ca. 260-340 C.E.). Eusebius' chronicle of world history was divided into two parts. The first part consisted of citations from primary historical sources and analysis of the chronologies of the Chaldeans, Egyptians, Hebrews, Greeks and Romans. The second part, known as the Canons, took the form of parallel chronological tables, into which Eusebius inserted brief historical notices. In the Canons, Eusebius dated events from the year of Abraham's birth.\n\nEusebius published several versions of the Chronicon. Although the Greek original does not survive, a complete copy of the chronicle survives in an Armenian translation. Jerome's own Latin translation was limited to the Canons, which he expanded to include events up to his day (326-378 C.E.). His edition of Eusebius' Canons provided the foundation for European historiography in the Middle Ages.\n\n### The Madaba Mosaic Map\n\nDoron Bar\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/bart1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe Madaba Mosaic Map is a unique piece of art created in the 6th century C.E. as a decoration for the pavement of a church in the town of Madaba (in today's Jordan). The mosaic represents the biblical land from Egypt to Lebanon, including Sinai, Israel, Palestine, and Transjordan. Unfortunately parts of the map were damaged during the 19th century but what remains is still of the greatest importance for art, history and biblical topography.\n\nThe city of Jerusalem is depicted with the utmost care, with more than 150 places or biblical memoirs that are presented in the preserved portion of the map. Most of the labels are concerned with biblical locales, regional names, and events. The map marks Jericho with palm trees, 12 stones at Gilgal, Jacob's well in Shechem, the Oak of Mamre at Hebron, John's baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River and Bethlehem. The largest and most detailed topographic element on the map is Jerusalem. The mosaic clearly shows a number of significant structures in the city: Damascus Gate, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the Tower of David and the main Cardo street.\n\n### The Assemani Codex of the Sifra\n\nBeth Berkowitz\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/berkowitz.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nVatican Codex Assemani 66 (Ebr. 66) is perhaps the oldest extant manuscript of rabbinic literature, dating possibly to the tenth century C.E. It features the rabbinic compilation known as the Sifra, which provides legal exegesis of Leviticus considered to date back to the second century C.E. In this passage (Sifra Aharei Mot 9), the rabbinic authors interpret Lev. 18:3, which instructs the Israelites to shun the practices of Egypt and Canaan. The midrash proposes that the intention of the verse is to prohibit only those gentile practices that are transmitted for generations, and it points to several marital practices, including homosexual marriage, as examples. The anonymous authors create here a sharply critical portrait of gentiles, but at the same time they expand the set of gentile practices permitted to Jews. The passage points to the complexity of the rabbinic response to the largely pagan culture of Palestine in that period.\n\n### King Solomon in Constantinople\n\nRa'anan Boustan\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/boustan-theodosius.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe little-studied Hebrew text known as \"The Hippodrome of Solomon\" (Ippodromin shel Shlomo) contains a stunning act of Jewish literary imagination: it represents the Jerusalem of King Solomon's day through the cultural lens of Byzantine urban life. In particular, it highlights the architecture and imperial ceremonial of the hippodrome in Constantinople in relation to this ancient model. Dating to some time between 600 and 950 C.E., this composition exhibits highly detailed knowledge of Byzantine court ritual, especially regarding the central place of the hippodrome and horse-racing in the imperial practice and ideology. The text's knowledge of Byzantine court life and what would seem to be its direct awareness of the genres and even specific examples of court literature suggest a view from \"within the palace\" or at the very least from \"within the capital.\"\n\nAt the same time, the text attributes its traditions to much earlier amoraic rabbis, such as R. Yohanan and Abbaye, and exhibits formal affinities to midrashic writings and styles of exegesis. This provocative fusion of Byzantine and rabbinic literary cultures need not surprise us. Both Jewish and Christian sources provide ample evidence for the existence of Jewish elites who belonged socially and culturally to the world of the Byzantine imperial court. This text thus demonstrates that in medieval Byzantium at least some Jews could integrate their knowledge of Hebrew and their commitment to Jewish communal life with their education in Greek literary culture and even a relatively high degree of identification with Byzantine interests.\n\n### Heliodorus Stele\n\nHannah Cotton\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/cotton.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/cotton-transcriptiont.gif\" alt=\"Click for transcription and translation\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nExhibited at The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, on long term loan from Michael and Judy Steinhardt, New York. Photo: The Israel Museum, Jerusalem/Peter Lanyi. Courtesy of and with thanks to the Israel Museum.\n\nThis is the upper half of a limestone stele inscribed in Greek with a copy of correspondence between King Seleucus IV (187-175 B.C.E.) and his officials. It probably stood in the sanctuary of a polis or village in this region. The stele preserves three letters, arranged from top to bottom in reverse chronological order. The king's letter, of which only the opening remains, is at the bottom of the stone and represents the earliest of the three missives. Those above it were written within a period of a few days of each other in August 178 B.C.E. In his letter, the king informs his viceroy Heliodorus, who is \"in charge of affairs\", of his decision to appoint an overseer of the sanctuaries in the satrapy (province) of Koilē Syria \\[Coele-Syria\\] and Phoinikē \\[Phoenecia\\], a territory encompassing the land of Israel. Heliodorus, in turn, conveys this decision to his subordinates.\n\nHeliodorus, revealed here as an actual historical figure, is well known from the dramatic episode in the Second Book of Maccabees, written by Jews in the mid-2nd century B.C.E. According to the account, King Seleucus IV sent Heliodorus to confiscate funds deposited in the treasury of the Temple in Jerusalem. Heliodorus's attempt to seize the funds was foiled by the miraculous appearance of a horseman in shining armor assisted by two strong youths, who beat the viceroy senseless. Heliodorus' life was spared only through the intervention of the high priest Onias III.\n\nThe story, an outstanding example of divine intervention in human destiny, was immortalized by Raphael in 1511-1512 in a fresco painted on the walls of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. The inscription provides important information on the workings of the Seleucid Empire in this region, this time from the Seleucid perspective: The King intended to bring the satrapy of Koilē - Syria and Phoinikē - into line with the rest of the empire by appointing an overseer of the sanctuaries - among them, the Temple in Jerusalem. The position presumably included authority over the sanctuaries' funds, above all taxes due to the king. It is likely that the Jews regarded this appointment as an infringement of Jewish religious autonomy, granted them by Seleucus's predecessor, Antiochus III. Thus the dramatic episode described in 2 Maccabees may represent a subjective reworking of the historical event from an internal Jewish perspective. The appointment may also mark the beginning of a process of Greek/Seleucid interference in Jewish religious affairs, which culminated in the decrees of Antiochus IV Epiphanes and would result in the outbreak of the Maccabean revolt a decade later, in 168 B.C.E.\n\n### Captiva Ivdaea\n\nPaula Fredriksen\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/fredriksen-obverse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/fredriksen-reverse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe image on this coin, held at the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies Library at Penn, resonates with so many issues in the tangled history of Jewish/Gentile relations in Mediterranean antiquity. It commemorates the defeat of the Jews - thus the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Temple in 70 C.E. - while at the same time it broadcasts the divine favor shown to the victors, Titus and his father, Vespasian. Vespasian had emerged the winner from the imperial sweepstakes that had paralyzed the Empire in 69 C.E., \"the year of the four emperors.\" Nero's sudden death had abruptly ended the Judeo-Claudian line, and power was up for grabs. (This dynastic collapse itself had encouraged Judea's revolt.) The Roman victory went a long way toward shoring up the fledgling Flavian dynasty's prestige and auctoritas. Vespasian wanted the news of his victory circulated - literally - as widely as possible.\n\nRoman art customarily depicted cities as feminine: indeed, Roma was worshiped as a goddess throughout the imperium. On the verso of this coin, however, only Judea/Jerusalem is gendered female: she sits in the dust, hand on head, contemplating her ignominy. Rome's victory is gendered male - the standing soldier/emperor/god looks down upon his humiliated captive. Heaven favors the victor, says this coin; heaven favored the Flavians, and Rome.\n\nThough later Christians claimed to worship the same supreme god as the Jews, this image of Judea's defeat remained a positive one for them. Gentile Christians associated Jerusalem's destruction with Judaism's rejection of Christian claims for Christ: indeed, the canonical gospels, each written after 70, place the \"prediction\" of the temple's destruction into the speech of their main character, Jesus of Nazareth. What began as a purely pagan sound bite, the image on this coin, ultimately grew into a major Christian claim: the imperial church also held that heaven favors victors: through the Jews' loss, claimed the bishops and emperors, Christianity had \"won.\"\n\n### Saint Stephen's Bones: A Chapter in the History of Jewish-Christian Relations in Late Antiquity\n\nPaula Fredriksen and Oded Irshai\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/fredriksen-irshai.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe story of St. Stephen's bones begins with a vision near Jerusalem and ends with sea voyages throughout the late Roman world. The proto-martyr of the early church, Stephen, through his recovered relics, instigated bouts of internal brawling between local bishops and spasms of external political struggles between Jewish dignitaries and the ascendant Church.\n\nJourneying further west, fragments of Stephen's body set off waves of anti-Jewish hostility. This animus had important consequences, from the forced converson of Minorca's Jews to Augustine's insistence on Jewish freedom of practice in his City of God. The relic controversy is illustrated in this unique, possibly fifth century C.E. ivory monument, the so-called \"Trier Ivory,\" named after the German Church where it is now located, depicting the \"adventus ceremony\" celebrating the bringing of the holy relics of the saints, perhaps to the gates of Constantinople, seat of the Byzantine Church.\n\n### The Damascus Document\n\nMaxine Grossman\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-11/damascusdocument.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nSometimes called \"the first Dead Sea Scroll,\" the Damascus Document is an ancient Jewish sectarian rule text that was initially discovered by Solomon Schechter in the late 1890s in the Cairo Genizah. Schechter's publication of the two manuscripts that he identified (one dated to the 10th century C.E. and one to the 12th) led to a flurry of responses by scholars who disagreed variously on the origins of the text (was it a \"true\" ancient document or a medieval \"forgery\"?) and the community with which it should be associated (Sadducean? Essene? Pharisaic? \"An Unknown Jewish Sect\"?). The discovery, half a century later, of ancient manuscripts of this very text in the caves at Qumran successfully confirmed the text's antiquity and also provided the Damascus Document with a historical social setting, in the context of ancient Jewish sectarianism.\n\n### Aramaic Magic Bowls\n\nYuval Harari\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/harari-bowl.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nMagical practices were part of every-day life in late antiquity. Magicians performed their craft for many practical purposes and for the benefit of both men and women. As magic was first and foremost a pragmatic technique, elements of magical expertise easily crossed ethnic as well as religious boundaries, especially in cases in which spells \"proved successful\". Moreover, magicians carefully controlled their exclusive knowledge. They transferred it orally or through written texts, even as they reshaped that knowledge according to the standards of the borrowing culture and assimilated it into their own distinct traditions. Professional interaction between Jewish and other experts of spells (Christians, Mandaeans, Zoroastrians and pagans) generated a shared magical tradition beyond cultural differentiation.\n\nAramaic magic bowls, manufactured in Babylonia in the 5th-7th centuries C.E., exemplify one of the ways by which Jews established their own type of adjurations within the shared genre of anti-demonic practices. The Jewish origins of these incantations are evidenced by the biblical verses and mishnaic paragraphs they cite and by their references to Jewish mystical and liturgical traditions. At the same time they strongly suggest a give-and-take relationship between Jews and their neighbors in this realm of popular religion. On the one hand, Babylonian and Persian gods and other spiritual entities are invoked in some of these bowls (along with Jesus) in order to expel harmful demons and evil sorceries from the house and the body of the persons for whom the bowls were prepared. On the other hand, the names of these persons mentioned in the bowls testify to the fact that they were frequently non-Jews themselves.\n\nIt is thus clear that in late antiquity all over Babylonia Jewish experts of magic, literate and highly familiar with their ancestors' tradition, employed various sorts of \"beneficial knowledge\" both from Jewish and non-Jewish origins. The writing of charms on clay bowls was meant to heal and protect their clients from demons and harmful sorceries and served a community much broader than their own Jewish one.\n\n### Israel and the Nations\n\nMarc Hirshman\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/hirshman-solidus.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nBy the time of the Roman emperor Julian in the fourth century C.E., the issue at stake for rabbinic sages was no longer the meaning of the election of Israel, a doctrine which was held in common by them, but rather the extent to which the God of Israel remained a universal God. Julian complained that according to the Jewish and Christian narrative, God had neglected all the other nations \"for thousands of years, while men in extreme ignorance served idols, as you call them, save only that little tribe which less than two thousand years before had settled in one part of Palestine.\" Some of the sages, as recorded in the Sifre Deuteronomy, an early midrashic text, it would seem reversed Julian's argument and claimed that the nations had neglected God so long that they were doomed. Other sages held that God's beneficence remained for all.\n\n(Quote and translation from Menahem Stern, vol 2, p. 533) Greek and Latin authors on Jews and Judaism / edited, with introductions, translations, and commentary, by Menahem Stern.

Additional inscriptions painted in plaster on the walls and have yet to be published. The mosaic is dated to the sixth century C.E., and contains extracts from the Palestinian Talmud (Yerushalmi) and some tannaitic works relating to the ritual boundaries of the Land of Israel and to the territories deemed obligated to or exempt from the biblical rules of tithing and related laws. The inscription is of great geographical interest. In addition, it serves as the terminus ante quemfor the practice of preserving rabbinic texts, or at least extracts, in writing. If it can be shown to have quoted from our Yerushalmi, it also contributes to the question of when that work was composed. Finally, because it appears in a village context and in a synagogue, it is an important datum in the debate about the extent and timing of \"rabbinization,\" the process whereby Jewish life in Palestine conformed to the norms and ideas of the rabbinic movement.\n\n### Hammat Tiberias Synagogue Mosaic\n\nLee Levine\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/levine-hammat.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe synagogue at Hammat Tiberias, located south of modern-day Tiberias, was discovered in 1961. The mosaic floor, dating to the last half of the fourth century C.E., is the earliest and one of the most impressive of such finds from Byzantine Palestine. The well-executed mosaic displays three panels. The first one, flanked by two lions and encountered upon entering the sanctuary, features eight Greek inscriptions listing the donors responsible for the founding/construction of the building. The main donor, whose inscription filled two squares in the panel, was Severus, who identified himself as being affiliated with the Patriarch, the leader of the Jewish community in the Roman Empire.\n\nThe second panel displays the signs of the zodiac, the four seasons, and an impressive representation of the sun god Helios in the guise of Sol Invictus (the unconquerable sun). The third panel, nearest the bima,displays a series of Jewish symbols, including the menorah, shofar, lulav, and ethrog.\n\nThe importance of this synagogue lies in the fact that it is the earliest known example of the widespread use of Greek and Greek names, the use of a blatant pagan motif in the center of the hall (which was to be copied in a number of other synagogues during the following centuries), and the use of Jewish symbols that were to become ubiquitous in the ancient synagogues of Palestine and the Diaspora.\n\n### Literary Anthropology and the Rabbinic Sense of Self\n\nJoshua Levinson\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/levinson-sacrifice-isaac.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nLate antiquity was witness to new ideas of the self, as the internal world of the individual became the center of intense religious, philosophical and ethical debate and speculation. This inward turn becomes acutely apparent when comparing biblical to rabbinic texts. In both legal and imaginative biblical texts both the legal subject and the narrative character are evaluated first and foremost by their actions. In rabbinic literature of late antiquity we can witness a new sense of self and a new theory of agency. Both legal and midrashic texts evaluate actions and agents based upon their internal deliberations. As legal texts become an exercise in self-fashioning, so the midrashic texts display an almost obsessive interest in a character's thoughts and motives. This transformation signals the emergence of a new type of subject, that was shared by both Roman and Christian discourses of Late Antiquity.\n\n### The Liturgical Poetry of Yose ben Yose\n\nOphir Münz-Manor\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4614_0003_web.jpg\" alt=\"Click on image (scans of full manuscript on OPenn site)\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nYose (son of Yose) is the first Jewish poet from late antiquity known to us by name and one of the finest Hebrew poets of all times. Yose was born sometime in the early fifth century C.E., in Palestine - most probably in the Galilee - and was among the first to introduce poetry to the synagogue services. This liturgical poetry, also know as Piyyut (a Greek loan-word), gradually gained its cultural prestige and became - by the mid seventh century - a hallmark of the Palestinian liturgical rite. A manuscript in the Genizah collection of the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies (Halper 247, folio 2v) preserves a beautiful composition that exemplifies Yose's artistry. The poem En Lanu Kohen Gadol (We Have no High Priest) - that was chanted on Yom Kippur - seeks to emphasize the religious crisis that followed the destruction of the Jerusalem temple. Yose enumerates the lost rituals of the temple and laments Israel's downfall in a brilliant poetic fashion, as the following lines demonstrate:\n\nWe have / no high priest // how shall we be pardoned / for our transgression?\n\nThe temple service has been eliminated // how shall we serve God while strangers rule over us?\n\nThere are no more / lamb sacrifices // how shall we immolate and Jerusalem is destroyed?\n\nPrayer has ceased in the house of prayer // how shall we offer prayers if God rejects them?\n\nWe have sinned - Almighty, forgive us, our Creator!\n\n### Between \"Judaism\" and \"Christianity\" in Late Antique Syria\n\nAnnette Yoshiko Reed\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/reed.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis book, from Penn's Rare Book and Manuscript collection, is one of the earliest printed versions of the Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions. The Recognitions were written in Greek in fourth-century Syria (possibly in Edessa). Today, the text of the Recognitions is preserved in whole only in Rufinus' Latin translation of 407 C.E. It is one of the two major surviving forms of the Pseudo-Clementine novel. Like the other major form - the Pseudo-Clementine Homilies - it appropriates the Greco-Roman genre of the novel to tell the story of the life of Clement of Rome, his travels with the apostle Peter, and Peter's debates with Simon Magus. The Homilies and Recognitions are widely believed to preserve important first-hand evidence for \"Jewish-Christianity.\" Both celebrate Peter, James, and the Jerusalem Church as the true heirs to Jesus. These books also voice surprisingly positive views of Jews and Judaism, and they outline dietary restrictions and prescriptions for ritual purity for Gentile followers of Jesus. In addition, they contain hints of familiarity with roughly contemporaneous Rabbinic traditions.\n\nRufinus' Latin translation of the Recognitions circulated widely in the Roman Empire in Late Antiquity and in Western Europe during the Middle Ages. The first printed edition of the Recognitions was that of Jacques Le Fèvre in 1504. The 1526 Basel edition, pictured here, was printed by Johannes Sichard, who appended a number of letters pseudepigraphically attributed to Clement of Rome, including the Epistle of Peter to Jamesand Epistle of Clement to James (both of which originally circulated with the Homilies). Sichard followed late antique and medieval tradition in asserting the authentic sub-apostolic origins of these writings. Although Sichard defended them against the charge of \"apocrypha,\" John Calvin, Voltaire, and others soon dismissed them as papal forgeries. The denunciation of these writings, during the Reformation and Enlightenment, arguably played a part in fostering modern scholarly assumptions of their marginal status and significance. It is only recently, for instance, that scholars have begun to recover the significance of the Pseudo-Clementine literature for our understanding of the interactions (and overlaps) between Jews, Christians, and \"pagans\" in late antique Syria.\n\n### A Greek Tombstone Inscription\n\nSeth Schwartz\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/schwartz.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe Center for Advanced Judaic Studies Library possesses a marble plaque containing the Greek epitaph of a man or boy whose Jewish identity is signified by the name Jeremias and the image of a menorah inscribed on the bottom right corner of the stone. This tombstone inscription probably dates from the 4th-5th centuries C.E., possibly from Palestine. Among the noteworthy features of this brief but enigmatic text is the appearance of two personal names not previously attested in either the Jewish or the Greco-Roman onomastica: Kolokasias and the feminine noun Theodotus. It is proposed that the inscription be translated as follows:\n\n\"Grave of Jeremias Kolokasias. Iose and Theodotus (made this) for their son\"\n\n### Letter of Bishop Severus of Minorca\n\nHagith Sivan\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/sivan-persecuted.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe Letter of bishop Severus of Minorca provides unique and in some ways horrific insight into relations between Jews and Christians on a tiny island in the Mediterranean in late antiquity. The letter describes, in gruesome details, a carefully devised campaign to convert forcibly the Jewish community on the island. The bishop enumerates a series of strategies aimed at changing the balance of communal relations in order to eliminate Judaism. Long suspected of being a forgery composed in the seventh century C.E. to support the Visigothic campaign of forced conversion of the Jews of Spain, the authenticity of the letter as an early fifth century C.E. composition has been vindicated through the discovery of the new letters of St Augustine of Hippo. The venerable African bishop was evidently informed of the happenings of Minorca although his reaction has not been recorded.\n\nThe Letter also illustrates the difficulties of reconstructing Jewish life in the Latin west. The sources are invariably written by Christians with a specific agenda rarely conducive to precision. Jewish reactions are presented through the prism of the converting agent. Other documents, such as inscriptions, or archaeological data, are either absent or rarely bear direct relevance to the contents of texts like Severus'letter.\n\n### Jewish Art in Antiquity: Go Figure!\n\nRina Talgam\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/talgam-kingdavid.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn contrast to the strict interpretation of the Second Commandment in the Hellenistic and Early Roman periods that led to an almost complete avoidance of animal and human representations, from the third century on the attitude of Jews towards figurative art became much more liberal. The different reactions to the threat posed by the art of the majority culture, which is reflected in the expansion of the border in the Second Temple period as opposed to the expansion of the dynamic area in the early Byzantine period, call for an explanation. What changed the Jewish attitude towards art? The waning of paganism allowed for the more extensive use of figures drawn from Greco-Roman art, but the main reason for the change was the need to contend with the rising power of Christianity, which used art as an efficient tool for establishing its faith.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Adler, William.** _Time immemorial : archaic history and its sources in Christian chronography from Julius Africanus to George Syncellus._ (Washington, D.C. : Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1989)\n    \n*   **Africanus, Sextus Julius.** _Chronographiae : the extant fragmentsSeries: Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten Jahrhunderte,_ Edited by Martin Wallraff, with Umberto Roberto, and, for the oriental sources, Karl Pinggéra; translated by William Adler (n.F., Bd. 15.

Instead of a year on the rabbis and their world, we have focused instead on the imperial context of which Judaism was but one small piece. How does this perspective change the sort of evidence and questions we bring to this era of seminal transformation in Jewish culture, law, society, art, and practice? The idea has been to foster vibrant reciprocity. Scholars of early Judaism need to be regularly challenged by the data and complexity of Roman history, even, and especially, as Rome became a Christian empire. The group has also pushed Roman history to better take the measure of the vast, but often inaccessible, evidence of one of its own (uniquely vocal) provincial populations - the Jews. The conversation has been extraordinary, and is reechoed in the diversity and range of the fellows convened, several of whom are represented in this exhibit. I hope you enjoy it, and get at least some taste of what has been an extraordinary year. I want to extend my sincere thanks to David Ruderman and the Center for supporting the year, to Arthur Kiron for curating this exhibit, to Greg Bear for the title graphic, to Leslie Vallhonrat for designing the on-line version of the exhibit, and especially to Ra’anan Boustan, Oded Irshai, and Seth Schwartz.

It features the rabbinic compilation known as the Sifra, which provides legal exegesis of Leviticus considered to date back to the second century C.E. In this passage (Sifra Aharei Mot 9), the rabbinic authors interpret Lev. 18:3, which instructs the Israelites to shun the practices of Egypt and Canaan. The midrash proposes that the intention of the verse is to prohibit only those gentile practices that are transmitted for generations, and it points to several marital practices, including homosexual marriage, as examples. The anonymous authors create here a sharply critical portrait of gentiles, but at the same time they expand the set of gentile practices permitted to Jews. The passage points to the complexity of the rabbinic response to the largely pagan culture of Palestine in that period.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"king-solomon-in-constantinople\">King Solomon in Constantinople\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Ra’anan Boustan\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/boustan-theodosius.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The little-studied Hebrew text known as “The Hippodrome of Solomon” (Ippodromin shel Shlomo) contains a stunning act of Jewish literary imagination: it represents the Jerusalem of King Solomon’s day through the cultural lens of Byzantine urban life. In particular, it highlights the architecture and imperial ceremonial of the hippodrome in Constantinople in relation to this ancient model. Dating to some time between 600 and 950 C.E., this composition exhibits highly detailed knowledge of Byzantine court ritual, especially regarding the central place of the hippodrome and horse-racing in the imperial practice and ideology. The text’s knowledge of Byzantine court life and what would seem to be its direct awareness of the genres and even specific examples of court literature suggest a view from “within the palace” or at the very least from “within the capital.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At the same time, the text attributes its traditions to much earlier amoraic rabbis, such as R. Yohanan and Abbaye, and exhibits formal affinities to midrashic writings and styles of exegesis. This provocative fusion of Byzantine and rabbinic literary cultures need not surprise us. Both Jewish and Christian sources provide ample evidence for the existence of Jewish elites who belonged socially and culturally to the world of the Byzantine imperial court. This text thus demonstrates that in medieval Byzantium at least some Jews could integrate their knowledge of Hebrew and their commitment to Jewish communal life with their education in Greek literary culture and even a relatively high degree of identification with Byzantine interests.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"heliodorus-stele\">Heliodorus Stele\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Hannah Cotton\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/cotton.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/cotton-transcriptiont.gif\" alt=\"Click for transcription and translation\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Exhibited at The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, on long term loan from Michael and Judy Steinhardt, New York.

It probably stood in the sanctuary of a polis or village in this region. The stele preserves three letters, arranged from top to bottom in reverse chronological order. The king’s letter, of which only the opening remains, is at the bottom of the stone and represents the earliest of the three missives. Those above it were written within a period of a few days of each other in August 178 B.C.E. In his letter, the king informs his viceroy Heliodorus, who is “in charge of affairs”, of his decision to appoint an overseer of the sanctuaries in the satrapy (province) of Koilē Syria [Coele-Syria] and Phoinikē [Phoenecia], a territory encompassing the land of Israel. Heliodorus, in turn, conveys this decision to his subordinates.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Heliodorus, revealed here as an actual historical figure, is well known from the dramatic episode in the Second Book of Maccabees, written by Jews in the mid-2nd century B.C.E. According to the account, King Seleucus IV sent Heliodorus to confiscate funds deposited in the treasury of the Temple in Jerusalem. Heliodorus’s attempt to seize the funds was foiled by the miraculous appearance of a horseman in shining armor assisted by two strong youths, who beat the viceroy senseless. Heliodorus’ life was spared only through the intervention of the high priest Onias III.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The story, an outstanding example of divine intervention in human destiny, was immortalized by Raphael in 1511-1512 in a fresco painted on the walls of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. The inscription provides important information on the workings of the Seleucid Empire in this region, this time from the Seleucid perspective: The King intended to bring the satrapy of Koilē - Syria and Phoinikē - into line with the rest of the empire by appointing an overseer of the sanctuaries - among them, the Temple in Jerusalem. The position presumably included authority over the sanctuaries’ funds, above all taxes due to the king. It is likely that the Jews regarded this appointment as an infringement of Jewish religious autonomy, granted them by Seleucus’s predecessor, Antiochus III. Thus the dramatic episode described in 2 Maccabees may represent a subjective reworking of the historical event from an internal Jewish perspective. The appointment may also mark the beginning of a process of Greek/Seleucid interference in Jewish religious affairs, which culminated in the decrees of Antiochus IV Epiphanes and would result in the outbreak of the Maccabean revolt a decade later, in 168 B.C.E.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"captiva-ivdaea\">Captiva Ivdaea\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Paula Fredriksen\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/fredriksen-obverse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/fredriksen-reverse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The image on this coin, held at the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies Library at Penn, resonates with so many issues in the tangled history of Jewish/Gentile relations in Mediterranean antiquity. It commemorates the defeat of the Jews - thus the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Temple in 70 C.E. - while at the same time it broadcasts the divine favor shown to the victors, Titus and his father, Vespasian. Vespasian had emerged the winner from the imperial sweepstakes that had paralyzed the Empire in 69 C.E., “the year of the four emperors.” Nero’s sudden death had abruptly ended the Judeo-Claudian line, and power was up for grabs. (This dynastic collapse itself had encouraged Judea’s revolt.) The Roman victory went a long way toward shoring up the fledgling Flavian dynasty’s prestige and auctoritas. Vespasian wanted the news of his victory circulated - literally - as widely as possible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Roman art customarily depicted cities as feminine: indeed, Roma was worshiped as a goddess throughout the imperium. On the verso of this coin, however, only Judea/Jerusalem is gendered female: she sits in the dust, hand on head, contemplating her ignominy. Rome’s victory is gendered male - the standing soldier/emperor/god looks down upon his humiliated captive. Heaven favors the victor, says this coin; heaven favored the Flavians, and Rome.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Though later Christians claimed to worship the same supreme god as the Jews, this image of Judea’s defeat remained a positive one for them. Gentile Christians associated Jerusalem’s destruction with Judaism’s rejection of Christian claims for Christ: indeed, the canonical gospels, each written after 70, place the “prediction” of the temple’s destruction into the speech of their main character, Jesus of Nazareth. What began as a purely pagan sound bite, the image on this coin, ultimately grew into a major Christian claim: the imperial church also held that heaven favors victors: through the Jews’ loss, claimed the bishops and emperors, Christianity had “won.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"saint-stephens-bones-a-chapter-in-the-history-of-jewish-christian-relations-in-late-antiquity\">Saint Stephen’s Bones: A Chapter in the History of Jewish-Christian Relations in Late Antiquity\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Paula Fredriksen and Oded Irshai\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/fredriksen-irshai.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The story of St. Stephen’s bones begins with a vision near Jerusalem and ends with sea voyages throughout the late Roman world.

This animus had important consequences, from the forced converson of Minorca’s Jews to Augustine’s insistence on Jewish freedom of practice in his City of God. The relic controversy is illustrated in this unique, possibly fifth century C.E. ivory monument, the so-called “Trier Ivory,” named after the German Church where it is now located, depicting the “adventus ceremony” celebrating the bringing of the holy relics of the saints, perhaps to the gates of Constantinople, seat of the Byzantine Church.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-damascus-document\">The Damascus Document\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Maxine Grossman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-11/damascusdocument.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Sometimes called “the first Dead Sea Scroll,” the Damascus Document is an ancient Jewish sectarian rule text that was initially discovered by Solomon Schechter in the late 1890s in the Cairo Genizah. Schechter’s publication of the two manuscripts that he identified (one dated to the 10th century C.E. and one to the 12th) led to a flurry of responses by scholars who disagreed variously on the origins of the text (was it a “true” ancient document or a medieval “forgery”?) and the community with which it should be associated (Sadducean? Essene? Pharisaic? “An Unknown Jewish Sect”?). The discovery, half a century later, of ancient manuscripts of this very text in the caves at Qumran successfully confirmed the text’s antiquity and also provided the Damascus Document with a historical social setting, in the context of ancient Jewish sectarianism.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"aramaic-magic-bowls\">Aramaic Magic Bowls\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Yuval Harari\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/harari-bowl.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Magical practices were part of every-day life in late antiquity. Magicians performed their craft for many practical purposes and for the benefit of both men and women. As magic was first and foremost a pragmatic technique, elements of magical expertise easily crossed ethnic as well as religious boundaries, especially in cases in which spells “proved successful”. Moreover, magicians carefully controlled their exclusive knowledge. They transferred it orally or through written texts, even as they reshaped that knowledge according to the standards of the borrowing culture and assimilated it into their own distinct traditions. Professional interaction between Jewish and other experts of spells (Christians, Mandaeans, Zoroastrians and pagans) generated a shared magical tradition beyond cultural differentiation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Aramaic magic bowls, manufactured in Babylonia in the 5th-7th centuries C.E., exemplify one of the ways by which Jews established their own type of adjurations within the shared genre of anti-demonic practices. The Jewish origins of these incantations are evidenced by the biblical verses and mishnaic paragraphs they cite and by their references to Jewish mystical and liturgical traditions. At the same time they strongly suggest a give-and-take relationship between Jews and their neighbors in this realm of popular religion. On the one hand, Babylonian and Persian gods and other spiritual entities are invoked in some of these bowls (along with Jesus) in order to expel harmful demons and evil sorceries from the house and the body of the persons for whom the bowls were prepared. On the other hand, the names of these persons mentioned in the bowls testify to the fact that they were frequently non-Jews themselves.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It is thus clear that in late antiquity all over Babylonia Jewish experts of magic, literate and highly familiar with their ancestors’ tradition, employed various sorts of “beneficial knowledge” both from Jewish and non-Jewish origins. The writing of charms on clay bowls was meant to heal and protect their clients from demons and harmful sorceries and served a community much broader than their own Jewish one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"israel-and-the-nations\">Israel and the Nations\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Marc Hirshman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/hirshman-solidus.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>By the time of the Roman emperor Julian in the fourth century C.E., the issue at stake for rabbinic sages was no longer the meaning of the election of Israel, a doctrine which was held in common by them, but rather the extent to which the God of Israel remained a universal God. Julian complained that according to the Jewish and Christian narrative, God had neglected all the other nations “for thousands of years, while men in extreme ignorance served idols, as you call them, save only that little tribe which less than two thousand years before had settled in one part of Palestine.” Some of the sages, as recorded in the Sifre Deuteronomy, an early midrashic text, it would seem reversed Julian’s argument and claimed that the nations had neglected God so long that they were doomed.

The inscription is of great geographical interest. In addition, it serves as the terminus ante quemfor the practice of preserving rabbinic texts, or at least extracts, in writing. If it can be shown to have quoted from our Yerushalmi, it also contributes to the question of when that work was composed. Finally, because it appears in a village context and in a synagogue, it is an important datum in the debate about the extent and timing of “rabbinization,” the process whereby Jewish life in Palestine conformed to the norms and ideas of the rabbinic movement.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"hammat-tiberias-synagogue-mosaic\">Hammat Tiberias Synagogue Mosaic\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Lee Levine\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/levine-hammat.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The synagogue at Hammat Tiberias, located south of modern-day Tiberias, was discovered in 1961.

The first one, flanked by two lions and encountered upon entering the sanctuary, features eight Greek inscriptions listing the donors responsible for the founding/construction of the building.

This inward turn becomes acutely apparent when comparing biblical to rabbinic texts. In both legal and imaginative biblical texts both the legal subject and the narrative character are evaluated first and foremost by their actions. In rabbinic literature of late antiquity we can witness a new sense of self and a new theory of agency. Both legal and midrashic texts evaluate actions and agents based upon their internal deliberations. As legal texts become an exercise in self-fashioning, so the midrashic texts display an almost obsessive interest in a character’s thoughts and motives.

Yose was born sometime in the early fifth century C.E., in Palestine - most probably in the Galilee - and was among the first to introduce poetry to the synagogue services. This liturgical poetry, also know as Piyyut (a Greek loan-word), gradually gained its cultural prestige and became - by the mid seventh century - a hallmark of the Palestinian liturgical rite. A manuscript in the Genizah collection of the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies (Halper 247, folio 2v) preserves a beautiful composition that exemplifies Yose’s artistry. The poem En Lanu Kohen Gadol (We Have no High Priest) - that was chanted on Yom Kippur - seeks to emphasize the religious crisis that followed the destruction of the Jerusalem temple.

The Recognitions were written in Greek in fourth-century Syria (possibly in Edessa). Today, the text of the Recognitions is preserved in whole only in Rufinus’ Latin translation of 407 C.E. It is one of the two major surviving forms of the Pseudo-Clementine novel. Like the other major form - the Pseudo-Clementine Homilies - it appropriates the Greco-Roman genre of the novel to tell the story of the life of Clement of Rome, his travels with the apostle Peter, and Peter’s debates with Simon Magus. The Homilies and Recognitions are widely believed to preserve important first-hand evidence for “Jewish-Christianity.” Both celebrate Peter, James, and the Jerusalem Church as the true heirs to Jesus. These books also voice surprisingly positive views of Jews and Judaism, and they outline dietary restrictions and prescriptions for ritual purity for Gentile followers of Jesus. In addition, they contain hints of familiarity with roughly contemporaneous Rabbinic traditions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Rufinus’ Latin translation of the Recognitions circulated widely in the Roman Empire in Late Antiquity and in Western Europe during the Middle Ages. The first printed edition of the Recognitions was that of Jacques Le Fèvre in 1504. The 1526 Basel edition, pictured here, was printed by Johannes Sichard, who appended a number of letters pseudepigraphically attributed to Clement of Rome, including the Epistle of Peter to Jamesand Epistle of Clement to James (both of which originally circulated with the Homilies). Sichard followed late antique and medieval tradition in asserting the authentic sub-apostolic origins of these writings. Although Sichard defended them against the charge of “apocrypha,” John Calvin, Voltaire, and others soon dismissed them as papal forgeries. The denunciation of these writings, during the Reformation and Enlightenment, arguably played a part in fostering modern scholarly assumptions of their marginal status and significance. It is only recently, for instance, that scholars have begun to recover the significance of the Pseudo-Clementine literature for our understanding of the interactions (and overlaps) between Jews, Christians, and “pagans” in late antique Syria.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"a-greek-tombstone-inscription\">A Greek Tombstone Inscription\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Seth Schwartz\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102040im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/schwartz.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The Center for Advanced Judaic Studies Library possesses a marble plaque containing the Greek epitaph of a man or boy whose Jewish identity is signified by the name Jeremias and the image of a menorah inscribed on the bottom right corner of the stone.

The bishop enumerates a series of strategies aimed at changing the balance of communal relations in order to eliminate Judaism. Long suspected of being a forgery composed in the seventh century C.E. to support the Visigothic campaign of forced conversion of the Jews of Spain, the authenticity of the letter as an early fifth century C.E. composition has been vindicated through the discovery of the new letters of St Augustine of Hippo. The venerable African bishop was evidently informed of the happenings of Minorca although his reaction has not been recorded.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Letter also illustrates the difficulties of reconstructing Jewish life in the Latin west.

The different reactions to the threat posed by the art of the majority culture, which is reflected in the expansion of the border in the Second Temple period as opposed to the expansion of the dynamic area in the early Byzantine period, call for an explanation. What changed the Jewish attitude towards art? The waning of paganism allowed for the more extensive use of figures drawn from Greco-Roman art, but the main reason for the change was the need to contend with the rising power of Christianity, which used art as an efficient tool for establishing its faith.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Adler, William.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Time immemorial : archaic history and its sources in Christian chronography from Julius Africanus to George Syncellus.\u003C/em> (Washington, D.C. : Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1989)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Africanus, Sextus Julius.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Chronographiae : the extant fragmentsSeries: Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten Jahrhunderte,\u003C/em> Edited by Martin Wallraff, with Umberto Roberto, and, for the oriental sources, Karl Pinggéra; translated by William Adler (n.F., Bd. 15.

This paradox is not hard to explain: Jews' historically disproportionate role in commerce and finance has been a source of embarrassed silence for some scholars and eager exaggeration for others, largely depending on one's attitude to capitalism and readiness to associate it prominently with Jews.\n\nThe year at The Katz Center devoted to \"Jews, Commerce and Culture\" had the ambitious aim of reconstituting the study of Jews and economy on grounds that are less ideological and teleological. The emphasis on \"commerce\" aimed to defuse apologetics by confronting the most controversial feature of the Jews' economic past head on. Here the overarching question was whether and how commerce can serve as a useful category for linking local Jewish communities and events across a wide geographical and chronological expanse. At the same time, the prominence in the title given to \"culture\" was meant to underscore the truth that economics is not solely materialist and quantitative in nature but is rather an integral part of the larger fabric of Jewish religion and folkways.\n\nThe papers presented in the weekly seminars and concluding colloquium (a number of which are represented in this web exhibit) reflected this eclectic outlook. Studies of Jewish business failure sought to counteract - or at least complicate - prevailing stereotypes of inevitable commercial triumph; analyses of transnational philanthropic efforts exposed the complex interrelationship between Jewish commercial and communal networks; while explorations of Jews' consumption practices inverted the more typical focus on Jews as sellers. These and the other innovative approaches adopted during the year suggest that the moment is ripe to bring economic matters into closer alignment with Jewish Studies as a whole.\n\n**Jonathan Karp**\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### Interested Parties: Thomas Aquinas, John Pacham, and Gerard of Aberville on Usury\n\nJoseph Shatzmiller\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/shatzmiller-68r.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/interested-parties-thomas-aquinas-john-pacham-and?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/shatzmiller-68v.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/interested-parties-thomas-aquinas-john-pacham-and?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/shatzmiller-69r.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/interested-parties-thomas-aquinas-john-pacham-and?item=2)\n\nIn the Fall of 2008, the Penn Libraries acquired a Latin codex of the turn of the 14th century (Ms. Codex 1271), a collection of short works by Thomas Aquinas \\[1225 - 1274\\].

Isaac of Corbeil authored his halakhic work the Amudei Gola (Pillars of Exile) popularly known as Semak (an acronym for Sefer Misvot Katan) circa 1276-1277. The raison d'être of the book was to strengthen religious observance of the commandments relevant to Jews living in the Diaspora. This was not a work written for scholars but rather one that whose purpose was to promote piety amongst the nation. In order to facilitate weekly study of his work he divided it into seven sections (pillars).\n\nIn a letter that Isaac circulated to the Jewish communities of France we learn how he acted to promote his book. He proposed that every community keep a copy of his work available for any one who wishes to copy it, even suggesting that they allocate funds that would allow the scribe to spend time in the community while copying the book. This is the only known example from medieval Ashkenaz of an author acting to promote his work. It is difficult to ascertain whether any community actually followed the dictates of the good Rabbi, nevertheless, it is quite clear that his book was one of the most popular halakhic books ever written in Northern France. Close to 200 medieval manuscripts survive till this day that bear witness to the immense popularity of the work.\n\n### \"Memorial der Tugend\" by Johann von Schwarzenberg\n\nMichael Toch\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/toch.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/memorial-der-tugend-johann-von-schwarzenberg?item=0)\n\nThis exquisitely crafted pen drawing comes from an early 16th century volume depicting edifying morality tales through episodes from the Bible and antique and medieval times. Here a peasant asks a Jew to lend him money against a pawn, inquiring about the interest, which by the Jew's own admission turns out to be horrendous. The bottom caption tells the moral of the story, with a clear invitation to the nobility to get rid of the Jewish plague, if need be by violence. It echoes a sentiment shared by many of this period, for instance the religious reformer Martin Luther:\n\n\"Whoever does wrong carries the same burden of guilt. Ill-begotten usurious gain is seldom inherited. Pay attention to this, you lords who hold Jews and enjoy the profit, or otherwise use your spear.\"\n\n### Rag Dealers and Pawnbrokers Have Their Place Too: The Start of Jewish Settlement in Livorno\n\nBernard Cooperman\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/0338_0007_web.jpg\" alt=\"Livornina, title page\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413/http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/pageturn.html?id=MEDREN_9949857513503681&rotation=0&currentpage=8)\n\nLivornina, title page\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/4876_0006_web.jpg\" alt=\"Statuti della Dogana, title page\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413/http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/pageturn.html?id=MEDREN_9915808803503681&rotation=0&currentpage=6)\n\nStatuti della Dogana, title page\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/4876_0014_web.jpg\" alt=\"Statuti della Dogana, first page\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413/http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/pageturn.html?id=MEDREN_9915808803503681&rotation=0&currentpage=15)\n\nStatuti della Dogana, first page\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cooperman-statuti82v83r-440.jpg\" alt=\"Statuti della Dogana, fols. 82v and 83r\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413/http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/pageturn.html?id=MEDREN_9915808803503681&rotation=0&currentpage=174)\n\nStatuti della Dogana, fols. 82v and 83r\n\nThe port city of Livorno on the Tuscan coast was the home of arguably the largest and wealthiest Jewish community in Italy during the seventeenth century. Established by a special charter, the so-called Livornina, in 1593 (see image at left), the community was organized as a merchant \"company.\" Subsidized by an enormous government loan, this corporation had special customs and tax privileges, its own recognized courts, and the right to admit (or refuse entry) to whomever it wished. The Medici rulers saw Jewish Sephardic merchants as a powerful force in Mediterranean trade and expected them to give Tuscany improved commercial access to the Ottoman Levant, Muslim North Africa, and (through converso relatives and contacts) the commercial network that radiated out from Spain and Portugal to encompass the entire globe.\n\nLivorno was then little more than a fishing village, filled with sailors, soldiers, thieves and prostitutes, and surrounded by malarial marshes. The Medici were investing huge sums in the town and its port facilities because the older port at Pisa, a few miles up the coast, had silted up and become unusable for sea-going vessels. The Livornina charter (and the letters sent out to advertise it) clearly assume that the wealthy merchants would live in Pisa and use Livorno only as a shipping point. To everyone's surprise, however, it was Livorno that grew rapidly, and the Jewish community there soon outstripped its \"mother colony\" demanding jurisdictional and economic independence. While the growth of Livorno's Jewry was undoubtedly motivated by merchants' desire to live conveniently near the harbor, it seems that the younger community was initiated by quite a different group of settlers..\n\nFrom the start it was clear that not all Jews were Sephardim (that is, of Iberian origin), nor were they all merchants. Italian Jewry of the era included many whose families had lived on the Peninsula for centuries, as well as thousands of recent immigrants from all over northern and western Europe. In many of the Italian states, government policy was becoming more restrictive towards Jews: outright expulsions or at least ghettoizations, were forcing Jews to move from place to place seeking haven and economic opportunity. Inevitably, some of these Jews appealed to the massari (communal stewards) in Pisa for admission, but the latter were unwilling to admit \"undesirables\" - that is, those likely to tarnish the image of Jews as wealthy and powerful merchants. Refused entry into the community of Pisa, some of these Jews appealed directly to the Medici for individual admission into Livorno.\n\nDisplayed here are the title page, first page with benediction, and pages 82v-83r of a vellum manuscript, volume 1 of Codex 266, in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at the University of Pennsylvania. This volume was intended as the official reference copy of the Statuti della Dogana, the regulations of the customs house at Livorno, reformed in 1565. Blank pages were left at the end so that any important new ruling could be added.\n\nOne such ruling was issue in September of 1593 in answer to the petition by David Sacerdote, a Spanish Jew, and Isache de Goilo, a Jew from Rome, for permission to settle in Livorno with their families, to open a new- and used-clothing shop in the town, and to travel around the Medici state buying up used goods that they could sell in their shop. Asked for his opinion, the governor of Livorno responded positively, both as to the usefulness of the shop and as to the desirability of another two families coming to settle in the town, especially since they might attract others. He did have some worries, however. The shop might become an outlet for stolen property and so the Jews would have to agree to present any used item to the customs officials before putting it on sale. The trade in used items must not be used to cover a money-lending operation. The shop should not be allowed to trade in woolen cloths since that would compete with the recently licensed woolens manufacture in the city. Grand Duke Ferdinando agreed with the governor, licensing the shop under the general terms described (though restricting used clothing purchases to the area immediately around Pisa and Livorno), and freeing the partners and their wives from the obligation to wear the Jewish badge, from customs duties and taxes, and from prosecution for past debts incurred elsewhere. Thus the petitioners were granted almost all of the privileges of the Pisan community even though they were not part of it and had to be registered individually in Livorno.\n\nHistorians are often hesitant to describe the Jewish \"rigattieri\" and \"straccieri\" - the rag dealers and second-hand shopkeepers who were so much a feature of the Jewish economy in past centuries. By euphemistically and narrowly referring only to the wealthier \"bankers,\" historians paint a picture of elegant financiers who are often also the cultural elite of their community. But Jewish \"banks\" were for the most part indistinguishable from what we now call pawnshops, serving, then as now, the marginal elements of society. This was a profitable, if risky and not particularly esteemed, profession, but it was one of the few available to Jews of sixteenth century Italy. It was the kind of activity that attracted Jews to the port of Livorno where a transient and often disreputable population often needed quick cash without too many questions asked. We can easily understand why wealthier Jewish merchants did not want to be associated with pawnbrokers and rag dealers. But government officials understood the economic need for such services, and in the frontier conditions of Livorno any settler, even a Jew, was to be valued. It was from such aggressive businessmen that the Jewish community of Livorno was to grow.\n\n### Transnational Philanthropic Systems in the Early Modern Jewish World: The Eastern European Jewish Refugee Crisis of the Mid-Seventeenth Century\n\nAdam Teller\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Teller-Bergeron-Tatars.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/transnational-philanthropic-systems-early-modern?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Teller-Bergeron-Map.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/transnational-philanthropic-systems-early-modern?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Teller-Bergeron-Title.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/transnational-philanthropic-systems-early-modern?item=2)\n\nWhen the Tatar forces - as depicted here in this early 18th century anthology of travel writing in French - crossed the Dniepr river to join the Cossack armies in their uprising against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1648, they set in motion a chain of events which would eventually change the map of Europe. One aspect of this was the fate of Eastern European Jewry. In the face of the massacres perpetrated first by the Cossack-Tatar forces, and later by the Swedish and Muscovite armies, many thousands of Jews fled, creating a wave of refugees not only within the Commonwealth, but also in Central and Western Europe and in the Mediterranean basin.\n\nIn order to help alleviate this problem, existing regional and intra-regional philanthropic systems came into play. The Lithuanian Jewish council coordinated efforts of the communities which comprised it to help settle the refugees, particularly the elderly, women and children, and to provide them with food, shelter and an income. Vienna acted as a central clearing house for the refugees in central Europe, not only giving them a place to stay but presiding over efforts to raise money for the collapsing Jewish communities of eastern Europe.\n\nThe Eastern European Jewish refugees in the Mediterranean basin, which included a high proportion of women, were largely swept up in the huge slave trade of the region. In the mid-seventeenth century, Jewish ransoming activities were conducted according to an agreement between the communities of Venice, Livorno, and Istanbul. This agreement collapsed in the face of the wave of refugees, whose representatives found themselves in competition with those ransoming other Jewish captives and those raising money for the Jewish poor of the Land of Israel. The lion's share of the costs of ransoming the eastern European Jews seem to have been borne by the Jews of Istanbul - a huge financial burden whose effects may have been felt for generations. In contrast, the Jews of eastern Europe managed to reconstruct their lives and their communities relatively quickly, thanks to their close co-operation with the enormously wealthy Polish magnates.\n\nAs the refugee crisis drew to an end, some Jews chose to return home to Poland-Lithuania, while others, particularly women, fearful of the dangers of travel, chose to remain where they were and start a new life. The spreading of the Polish-Lithuanian Jewish refugees as far afield as the eastern Mediterranean, the Maghreb, Central Europe and the Atlantic seaboard raised a great deal of interest among the Jewish population already settled there. This acted as a stimulus to Jewish publishing in both Hebrew and Yiddish.\n\nIn somewhat similar fashion, the great geographical discoveries of the early modern era and Europe's colonial expansion created a thirst for knowledge about distant places and peoples in many European countries. In response, anthologies of travel literature became a highly popular genre. The images shown here illustrate one such travel anthology - Voyages faits principalement en Asie dans les XII, XIII, XIV, et XV siecles, published by Pieter van der Aa, La Haye 1735. This book reprinted the work of the seventeenth century French geographer, Pierre de Bergeron (1580-1657), who translated into French a number of travel narratives (including that of the Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela). The images shown here illustrated a text entitled, l'Histoire des Mongols appelés par nous Tartares, description des coutumes, de la géographie, de l'histoire et des figures marquantes du peuple mongol, which was originally written by the Papal legate to the Mongol Khans, Giovanni dal Piano dei Carpini (in French, Jean du Plan Carpin) in the thirteenth century.\n\n### Don Francisco de Quevedo and the myth of Jewish world finance\n\nCarsten Wilke\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/wilke.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn a chapter of his political satire called The Hour of All Men (La hora de todos), the Spanish classic Francisco de Quevedo invented around 1635 one of the central myths of modern anti-semitism: Jewish finance controls the world by means of the trans-national credit market. In this fanciful conspiracy plot, representatives of twelve major Jewish centers congregate in the Ottoman port of Salonica in order to receive a delegation of Machiavelian politicians from the Spanish government. Both sides agree to abolish Christianity and to replace it with the cult of money. The Jewish bankers vaunt that they have submitted the warfaring European powers by entangling them into an \"indissoluble knot\" of financial interdependence, in which Dutch fleets are armed with trading profits from Spain, and Spanish batallions raised with credit from Amsterdam stocks.\n\nQuevedo superimposes a medieval religious stereotype to the unsettling economic realities created in the early seventeenth century by the first appearance of negotiable stocks, the stock exchange, central banks and a world wide trade in debts. The Portuguese Jewish merchants, whose dealings he satirizes, neither invented nor monopolized these instruments of financial rationality, but they used them at an early stage in the framework of what has been considered as the first global trading diaspora in modern history.\n\nThe Hour of All Men was printed under a pseudonym in 1650, the fifth edition, displayed here, being the first to mention the author's name. An English translation appeared in 1697.\n\n### Jews and the Liquor Trade\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dynner1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dynner3.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/jews-and-liquor-trade?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dynner2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/jews-and-liquor-trade?item=2)\n\nThese pages are excerpted from the first edition (Frankfurt, 1705) of Kav ha-yashar (\"A Just Measure\"), by Zvi Hirsch Koidanover (1655-1712). (Image, left, top, shows the author' introduction and the first page.) This enormously popular demonologically-charged mystical ethical book was reprinted dozens upon dozens of times in Hebrew, produced in a bilingual Hebrew and Yiddish version by the author, and eventually translated into Ladino. Many of its admonitions and Zoharic excerpts appear aimed at traveling merchants, warning of the ethical pitfalls they might encounter on their journeys. The small dimensions of the book would seem to confirm this authorial intent. Koidanover was born in Vilna and raised in Kurów (near Lublin). He moved to Nikolsburg (Moravia) after 1655 and then settled in Frankfurt am Main in 1667. He later returned to Vilna, where he prospered but was imprisoned. He returned permanently to Frankfurt in 1696. His observations thus reflect the inner life of Jews in the Polish, Czech, and German lands.\n\nThe pages reproduced here reflect the fascinating relationship between Jews and alcohol. By the end of the eighteenth century about 80 percent of rural Jews in Poland-Lithuania were involved in the sale and production of liquor. According to available data, Jews comprised 94 percent of urban and at least 78.7 percent of rural tavern keepers among seven towns and fifty-one villages in Bielsk County (Podlaskie District) during this period. A centerpiece of the reform initiatives of the Prussian, Russian, and Austrian monarchs who annexed the Polish lands during this period was the elimination of the rural Jewish liquor trade, which they attempted by means of escalating concession fees and outright expulsions. Surprisingly, few rabbinic or Hasidic leaders protested these draconian measures. It appears they themselves were uncomfortable with the tavern keeping profession. An excerpt from Kav ha-yashar (see images, left, middle) illustrates this ambivalence:\n\n> When one builds a house or designates a special room in one's house for the uncircumcised to come and drink, party, and fornicate, a common sin which many have committed in Poland and Lithuania, and which no one prohibits: In such a case the spirit of defilement will certainly settle upon the house and the one who built it will not leave this world until he is punished through that very house.\n\nWhy was the Polish nobility so inclined to lease its taverns and distilleries to Jews in the first place? Among the several explanations supplied by historians is the notion of Jewish sobriety: Jewish tavern keepers, in contrast to their Christian counterparts, tended not to drink up their profits. The following excerpt from Kav ha-yashar (see image, left, bottom) gives pause to such assumptions:\n\n> I have noticed that many people in this region are so enslaved to their appetites that immediately upon awakening, hours before dawn, they believe they will die if they do not drink liquor. And they think that it is perfectly permissible to indulge their lusts and stubborn hearts. And sometimes they drink to the point of intoxication. And afterwards, when the time of morning prayer arrives, their prayer is not fluent. And this is a terrible sin, which many luminaries have committed.\n\nNevertheless, we cannot conclude that alcoholism was a widespread problem in Jewish society. Such admonitions occur infrequently in ethical literature; while Slavic folk sayings reflect a widespread perception of Jewish sobriety during this period. There may still be something to the hypothesis!\n\n### In Dispute: Commerce, Commercial Courts, and Bills of Exchange\n\nCornelia Aust\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aust-title.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/dispute-commerce-commercial-courts-and-bills?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aust-front.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/dispute-commerce-commercial-courts-and-bills?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aust-bill1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/dispute-commerce-commercial-courts-and-bills?item=2)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aust-bill2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/dispute-commerce-commercial-courts-and-bills?item=3)\n\nThis is the front page of Paul Jacob Marperger's work on the usefulness and duties of the newly-founded commercial council in Prussia. Marperger (1656-1730) was the son of a German officer but took an apprenticeship with a French trading house. He became one of the first German writers on issues of mercantilism, cameralism, and commercial practices. In this and numerous other works he discussed the importance and the obligations of the mercantilist state. He examined the mechanisms of commerce, commercial courts, different commercial laws and regulations, bills of exchange and a wide array of similar topics. In 1708, he became a member of the Prussian Society of the Sciences and in 1724, he was appointed to the Royal Court and Commerce Council of Poland and the Electorate of Saxony.\n\nThe title page is accompanied by a copper engraving that depicts the members of the commercial council holding an open book with the inscription Fides et Veritas \\[Faith and Truth\\] across from a group of merchants who bring forward complaints and appeals to the council. In the background, a number of merchants are sitting around a table with different writing utensils, probably drawing a contract, while outside the window one recognizes the sea with incoming ships, a covered market building, an open market space, merchants, coaches, as well as barrels and packs of merchandize. A scroll on top of the picture names some of the most important places of commerce in Europe: Amsterdam, Bordeaux, Breslau, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Leipzig, Nuremberg, Lyon, and Venice. While Jewish merchants do not figure prominently in Marpergerb's work, they took a very active part in the commerce of early modern Europe and were regular visitors of fairs. Specific commercial courts became more and more a necessity with the growing volume of trade and the increase of complicated credit actions that were facilitated through bills of exchange. In Leipzig, which held one of the most important fairs, a commercial court was founded in 1682 because the municipal courts were overwhelmed with the amount and intricacy of the cases brought before it.\n\nThough bills of exchange have existed since the Middle Ages, they became more suitable for long-distance trade and the provision of credit, which both were closely intertwined, in the early modern period with the general acceptance of the endorsement on the back of the bill. This allowed circulating a bill of exchange as currency which made bill transactions more flexible. This bill of exchange was issued in Warsaw in 1790 by a non-Jewish merchant to the Jewish banker Simon Symons from Amsterdam. It could be redeemed two months later from the Christian banking house Eichborn & Co. in Breslau.\n\nOn the back, one can see how it went through the hands of six different Christian and Jewish merchants and bankers and from Warsaw to Hamburg and Berlin before the bill was met in Breslau. However, the use of bills of exchange and especially their wide circulation had to be based on trust since everyone in the chain who paid (in cash or goods) had to rely not only on the previous endorser but on the original drawer or on every person involved in the chain of circulation. False bills of exchange were not a rarity and it was not uncommon that an original drawer had no credit with the payer. Thus, commercial courts that were competent to deal with complicated matters of bills and commerce were regarded as crucial by Marperger and others.\n\n### Sephardic Merchant Trade\n\nEvelyne Oliel-Grausz\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/olielgrauz.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis bill of lading, drawn up in 1771, describes the cargo shipped from Newport to Surinam by Aaron Lopez, a Sephardi merchant who lived as a New Christian in Portugal until 1752 when he fled Lisbon to join his brother in Newport. During the following decade, in the context of the French and Indian war, Lopez expanded the scope of his mercantile activities to Western Europe, the Caribbean, Newfoundland, Africa, and when this document was drawn up he had become one of Newport's leading merchants.\n\nSeveral features of early modern commerce may be emphasized using this document, which belongs to the Library at the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, but which is one of many preserved in Aaron Lopez's papers, seized after his premature death (1782) in order to assess his indebtedness. The most striking feature is the variety of commodities composing this cargo. Even if Lopez is known for his contribution to the trade in spermaceti (the head matter of the sperm whale used in the manufacturing of candles), which does not appear in this cargo, this document epitomizes the nature of early modern trade, generally not specialized but, rather, organized along routes, the merchants trading in whatever wares are available or in demand and likely to bring about a profit: here together with naval stores, construction materials (bricks), we have items related to cooperage, (hogsheads, i.e., barrel staves or hoops, dismantled barrels,. . .), horses, pieces of furniture, tobacco, as well as a variety of foods intended for different groups of consumers: pork, butter, herring, but also kosher foods, \"Jew beef,\" \"Casher Fatt,\" \"Casher Tongues.\" Thus, together with the standard routes and products of colonial trade, the sub-species of kosher trade features here prominently.\n\nAaron Lopez was providing similar wares to other Caribbean communities, namely Jamaica and Curaçao. This bill mentions that Aaron Lopez owns the brig - therefore no freight is to be paid - and not only the merchandise. Around 1772, Aaron Lopez owned about twenty ships. Another essential actor of this maritime trade appears here with the figure of the Captain: much of the enterprise rested on the Captain's skills and a trusting relationship between him and the merchant was essential to a successful venture, for which the captain was often rewarded with a commission on top of his salary.\n\nThe goods mentioned in this cargo are sent to Surinam, a Dutch possession, plausibly to Jewish and non-Jewish correspondents. This consignment is but one aspect of the links between Jewish communities in colonial America: a few years earlier, for instance, the Surinam Portuguese community had agreed to make a substantial donation to help the congregation Yeshuat Israel of Newport complete the building of its synagogue. Merchant networks, though implicit in this document, do not feature directly in it: Lopez's partners, in Newport, London or the Caribbean comprised Jews and non-Jews, Askenazi and Sephardi merchants. Other essential aspects of Aaron Lopez's mercantile activities do not appear here, such as his involvement in the slave trade, but should be recalled in order to understand the scope and nature of his mercantile activities.\n\n### Going for Broke: Traité des Faillites et Banqueroutes\n\nJessica Roitman\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/roitman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nTraité des Faillites et Banqueroutes, written in the early 19th century, is one of the first attempts to collect and codify bankruptcy laws both in France and through Europe. Until then, bankruptcy law had been a hodgepodge of local, regional, national, and common law. This effort was an implicit recognition of what had been clear since time immemorial - merchants could and did renege on their debts, leading themselves and their entire business networks into insolvency. In short, networks could and did fail.\n\nSephardic networks were as prone to disintegration as any other. A close look at the archival documentation of the Amsterdam Sephardic community paints a picture of fractiousness, dissent, religious unrest, and civil lawsuits. This reality challenges the conventional wisdom of the efficiency of Jewish trade networks based on family, kinship, and shared ethno-religious background. In fact, Sephardic traders in 17th century Amsterdam often brought each other to ruin, either through bad luck, ineptitude, or malfeasance. Their tightly-woven networks only exacerbated the domino effect if one merchant failed. Sephardic merchants were as likely as any other to declare bankruptcy in civil court, and depend on the law, such as it was, to decide their fate.\n\n### Ludwig Börne and the predicament of Jewish class relations\n\nAdam Sutcliffe\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sutcliffe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nLudwig Börne was born - as Juda Löw Baruch - in 1786 into a wealthy banking family in the Frankfurt Ghetto. In 1811, taking advantage of the Napoleonic emancipatory legislation, he took a position in the administration of Frankfurt's police records. In 1815, when these laws was revoked, Börne lost his job. For the rest of his life, despite his conversion to Protestantism in 1819, he made his living as an outsider: a freelance writer, journalist and political radical. He rushed to Paris when revolution broke out there in July 1830, and lived there almost continually, in effective exile, until his death in 1837.\n\nBörne decisively rejected his religious upbringing, and his writings include plenty of hostile comments about Jews, and particularly about Jewish commerce. However, far from being a 'self-hating Jew,' Börne was keenly aware of the Jews' political vulnerability. He understood this, however, within a wider context of class relations between the ruling elite and the oppressed masses, between whom the Jews, because of their intermediary economic role, were precariously squeezed, serving elites as a protective shield. Börne's political thought was characterized by a striking clarity concerning power relations in society, an engaged realism, a commitment to economic and political justice, and a loosely messianic sense of impending transformation. In all of these aspects his ideas were profoundly shaped by his Jewish background.\n\n### The Cheap Jewish Library\n\nAdam Mendelsohn\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/mendelsohn-cheap.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/cheap-jewish-library?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/mendelsohn-misc-days.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/cheap-jewish-library?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/mendelsohn-misc-perez.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/cheap-jewish-library?item=2)\n\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, publishers in the United States and England began to court a mass Jewish market, producing literature - newspapers, tracts, catechisms, novels, and Bibles - for distribution cheaply and in large quantities. This trend was partly a result of the falling costs of printing. Yet its initial driving impulse came from missionary publishers rather than Jewish sources. Christian Evangelicals were among the first to grasp the implications of mass publishing, skillfully utilizing the printing press to communicate with their followers and win new converts.\n\nThe scale and persistence of mission efforts to supply Jews in America and England with their literature galvanized a Jewish response. While this response was undoubtedly defensive, it also reflected a new awareness of pent-up demand among Jews for books, tracts, pamphlets, printed sermons, and Bibles.\n\nThe Cheap Jewish Library - the name echoed the immensely popular evangelical Cheap Repository Tracts - was started and subsidized anonymously by Charlotte Montefiore and her sister Louisa de Rothschild, daughters of the aristocratic Jewish cousinhood, in London in 1841. (David Aaron de Sola, the hazan at Bevis Marks handled the practicalities of publication.) Single-page tracts were sold for a penny - tantamount to giving them away - with the intention of reaching the \"humbler classes\" to provide \"instruction by means of interesting tales.\"\n\nThe cheap tracts were intended to rival the flood of moralistic material that gushed from the presses of the interdenominational Religious Tract Society and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. These and other publishing houses produced millions of tracts annually, saturating the reading public with a ceaseless tide of uplifting tales and exhortations that conveyed lessons in Christian faith and virtue. While Jewish writers had produced plenty of polemical anti-missionary works before the 1840s, the mass produce pamphlets produced under the Cheap Jewish Library imprint contained a more subtle counter conversionist agenda.\n\nLike their Christian counterparts, the tracts tended towards saccharine stories, often barely concealing a core of \"doctrinal information,\" Biblical and Jewish history. The tales were written by a roster of writers that included Grace Aguilar. Her serialized Perez Family, for example, depicted the evil consequences of irreligion and intermarriage. The patrician project also imparted \"practical lessons for the everyday life\": thinly disguised lectures on hygiene, decorum and comportment. The Cheap Jewish Library proved far more palatable on both sides of the Atlantic than some of the rival series produced under Jewish auspices. Isaac Leeser was an early and enthusiastic supporter of the series. His Jewish Publication Society, founded in Philadelphia in 1845, reprinted tracts from the Cheap Jewish Library under the Jewish Miscellany imprint.\n\n### Economies of Dress and Social Satire\n\nMarcin Wodzinski\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/wodzinski.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nNegative attitudes towards Hasidism held by 19th century Jewish enlighteners, known in Hebrew as \"maskilim,\" found expression not only in numerous and well known literary texts, such as the satires by Josef Perl, but also in visual images. One of the best examples is a drawing published by Leon Hollanderski (or Hollenderski), a Polish Jew sympathetic to the ideas of the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) and, after 1831, a political émigré in France. In 1845 Hollanderski published in Paris his Les Israelites de Pologne, the very first history of Polish Jews written by a Jewish author. One of the charts in the book depicts \"Le Chasside et sa femme,\" which is today one of the best known nineteenth-century images of a Hasid.\n\nHowever, this widely known drawing is far from neutral and, in fact, should be understood as a kind of caricature of the Hasidic movement. First of all, one should bear in mind that the elements that todaybo?=s reader tends to understand as Hasidic dress were, in fact, common for most, if not all, nineteenth-century Polish Jews. For example, the spodek (tall fur hat), the kapote (long dark coat), and even the slippers (instead of boots) are not distinctive in themselves. Possibly, the only clearly Hasidic elements of dress that the image depicts are white undergarments and a gartel (wide belt). What, then, is Hasidic about the depicted Hasid? Hollanderski characterizes him by three distinctive social elements: (1) a shabby beard suggesting an untidiness allegedly typical for all the Hasidim; (2) a lulke (long pipe) referring to a well-known Hasidic attraction to tobacco; (3) a red nose and a bottle of brandy in hand referring to a Hasidic custom of drinking tikun (a sacred toast), also reflecting a popular accusation made by maskilim about Hasidic abuses of alcohol. Though each of these elements referred to some historical reality, none of them was accurate and neutral. Together they produced a highly biased and ideologically loaded portrait of a Hasid and, by implication, Hasidism.\n\n### Jewish Transnational Philanthropy and Politics: Theory and Practice\n\nJonathan Dekel-Chen\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dekelchen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nCain may have been the first to ask, \"Am I my Brother's Keeper?\" but Jews in different lands have answered this question in different ways over the millennia. Their brotherly actions on behalf of those in need have included the giving of charity, the organization of welfare services, reconstruction projects, intercession with governments and the mobilization of public opinion. Over the last 150 years, one of the consistent targets of this Jewish transnational intercession has been East European Jewry, where the knowledge of the repression and impoverishment against their brethren has sparked Jews in Western Europe and the Americas to action.\n\nThis pamphlet, part of the holdings of the Library at the Katz Center at Penn, was published by the Russo-Jewish Committee of British Jewry in 1891; it attempted to draw public attention among English-speakers everywhere to the plight of Russia's Jews. Historians may still argue about the degree to which this, and subsequent, mobilizations in the Jewish world pushed the Russian and Soviet regimes toward improving their treatment of Jews. Whatever the outcome of these scholarly debates, it is nonetheless true that efforts like these forced the issue of Russian and Soviet Jewry closer to the news headlines and the global agenda than otherwise would have been the case.\n\n### Dreyfus Was Not Alone: Jewish Officers in the French Army\n\nDerek Penslar\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/penslar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nHowever extraordinary the Dreyfus Affair may have been, in many ways Captain Alfred Dreyfus was typical of hundreds of Jews who served as career officers in the French military in the late 1800s. Like most of his peers, Dreyfus attended the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique, which trained civilian engineers as well as officers for the artillery and engineering corps. Dreyfus then attended the recently established Ecole Supérieure de Guerre, as did several other Jews who went on to long and successful military careers.\n\nFrom the mid 1800s through 1930s, military careers were important sources of social mobility for French Jewish men. Jewish army officers often came from humble backgrounds (Dreyfus was an exception) but thanks to the prestige of a military commission, Jewish officers married women from well-to-do families and enjoyed considerable prestige in their communities. At times Jewish officers parlayed their military expertise into business success, particularly in French Indochina.\n\nDreyfus' downfall came when he entered the newly revamped General Staff, where old notions of advancement through noble birth and family connections were challenged by new demands for meritocracy. Although Dreyfus was not the first or only Jewish senior staff officer in the French army, he was the first to serve in the new General Staff. Even here, many of his colleagues thought well of him, but resentment built up against the wealthy, brilliant and somewhat arrogant young officer. Dreyfus' zeal and excellent memory, combined with his being a Jew from Alsace, lent credence to the unjust accusation in October of 1894 that Dreyfus was a German spy.\n\n### Kosher Margarine\n\nGideon Reuveni\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/reuveni-palmin.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nFeatured here is an advertisement for Palmin margarine in a Jewish cockbook from 1909. Palmin was developed by the German chemist Dr. Heinrich Schlinck (1840-1909) at the end of the 19th century as a substitute for animal-based cooking fats. The name Palmin denotes the origin of the product from coconut, that is palm tree. Since margarine was manufactured from vegetable fat, it could be used in cooking both meat and dairy dishes. Before the Great War Palmin, along side another margarine that was manufactured by the firm H. Schlinck & Cie. by the name of Palmona, was marketed as a Kosher brand allowing the Jewish kitchen to broaden its range of tastes by using new recipes previously prohibited by the laws of kashrut. Palmin was not the only kosher vegetable butter at that time. Another well-known kosher margarine was \"Tomor,\" which was produced by Van den Bergh, a Dutch food corporation, at their German branch in the Kleve. Van den Bergh's founder the Dutch industrialist, Simon Van den Bergh (1819-1907), was an observant Jew. Both Palmin and Tomor are brand names that are still used today.\n\n### The Jarmulowksy Bank, corner of Orchard and Canal Streets, New York City, 1912\n\nRebecca Kobrin\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/kobrin.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nAfter years of spiraling real estate prices, fears of long protracted war prodded thousands of New York Jews to withdraw money from their local banks during the summer of 1914. For years these \"banks\" had not only kept immigrant Jews' small deposits, but also helped them buy ship tickets for their loved ones in Europe and transfer money back there. Unable to return depositors' funds, New York State's Bank Superintendent forced one of the largest banks on New York's Lower East side, Sender Jarmulowsky's bank, founded in 1873 and claiming over 60,000 depositors, to shutter its doors. On August 30, 1914, the largest financially-driven riot in New York City history to date broke out in front of Jarmulovsky's bank. Demanding the bank return their deposits, the enraged crowd of East European Jews paraded to City Hall where they attacked clerks, forcing police to arrest nine and use clubs to quell rest. The riot frightened city officials, who assigned the city's revered judge, Learned Hand, to settle the claims. Hand soon uncovered that the bank's assets were all tied up in real estate speculation in East Harlem. The incident provoked a myriad of court cases, Hand to write precedent-setting judicial decisions and city officials to craft new banking legislation to protect New York from becoming infected with \"speculitis,\" a disease all agreed was transforming not only New York but America itself.\n\nWhile few today recognize the name Jarmulowsky or can identify this family's bank - nicknamed \"the Temple of Capitalism,\" the building still stands on the corner of Canal street and East Broadway. This bank and its failure highlight a fascinating aspect of the American economy in the early-twentieth century: while East European Jews occupied marginal (and often disreputable) niches in the businesses of shipping and banking and invited suspicion from large portions of society, they nonetheless were able to move into the mainstream sectors of the economy in a comparatively brief time span by acquiring substantial capital through their risky ventures.\n\n### Are you your brother's keeper?\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/jewish-relief.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nWith powerful photographs and a compelling bilingual text, this 1922 poster urges the Jews of Philadelphia - many of them of East European origin - to come to the aid of their suffering brethren, whose lives had been devastated by World War I and its aftermath. While the images display the Jews' suffering, the Yiddish headline asks boldly: \"ARE THEY YOUR KIN?\" and the anser is \"Your brothers, your sisters, your dearests will die if you are unable to help them.\" The text ends with a dramatic declaration: \"THEIR LIVES ARE IN YOUR HANDS.\"\n\nThe poster also reflects the rising dominance of American Jewry and the parallel waning of the influence and power of European Jewish philanthropists. This shift in authority and clout was accelerated by The Great War of 1914-1918, continued throughout the interwar years, and came to its tragic conclusion during the Holocaust.\n\nImmediately after the outbreak of WWI, American Jews began sending money to help the Jews of Europe (and the small Jewish community in Palestine). These efforts quickly evolved into well-organized nationwide fundraising campaigns. New philanthropic organizations were established, prominent among them the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (the \"Joint\") and tens of millions of dollars were collected in just a few years.\n\nTwo words that appear at the bottom of the poster reflect two distinct ideologies that guided American Jewry's aid to European Jews. The term \"Relief\" relates to charitable activities, spanning from medical aid to soup kitchens. The term \"Reconstruction\" refers to a system that promoted self help. The desire to help East European and Zionist Jews to help themselves dominated Jewish philanthropic initiatives in the USA. \"Reconstruction\" helped Jews in Poland, Romania and even in the Soviet Union rebuilt their lives in the post-1918 world and gave them hope. Stalin's purges of Jewish life, including the Jewish agricultural settlements in the Crimea and Southern Ukraine established by the Joint (\"Agro-Joint\"), and the Holocaust brought the Reconstruction efforts to a tragic halt.\n\n### Shtraymels under the railroad bridge - Antwerp Jews, Orthodoxy, and Diamonds\n\nVeerle Vanden Daelen\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/daelen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nTwo Hasidic men on their bikes, stopping under the railroad bridge to chat: this is an everyday scene in Antwerp, especially in the neighborhood close to the central railway station and the diamond district. Within this so-called Jewish neighborhood lives a high concentration of Antwerp's (mainly) Orthodox Jewish population, along with non-Jewish inhabitants.\n\nSince the end of the nineteenth century the number of Jews in Antwerp has risen considerably (ca. 1,200 in 1880 to 35,500 in 1939). The diamond trade, which expanded parallel with the influx of Jewish immigrants, attracted a rising number of Jewish newcomers and became the economic motor of Jewish life in the city. When things went well in diamonds, Jewish life flourished. But when the diamond business entered periods of crisis, Jewish institutions and organizations were the first to notice and be affected. Jews occupied key positions in the management of the diamond industry and newcomers could advance far within it, often in a relatively short time. All sorts of Jewish life - Orthodox, Zionist, Communist, Socialist, etc. - were visible around the diamond district and the adjacent Jewish neighborhood.\n\nThe Second World War and the persecution and annihilation of Jews devastated Antwerp's Jewish life. Approximately 65 percent of Antwerp's registered Jewish population was deported, and few survived. Just before and during the war a considerable number of people in the diamond sector fled the country. The major destinations for this resultant diamond diaspora were London, New York, and South America. That Jewish life exists today in Antwerp has much to do with the wartime preparations of the former Antwerp mayor and two Jewish diamond merchants in exile in London. They began planning for the diamond industry's return to Antwerp already during the war. With the eagerness and the efforts of the Belgian and local Antwerp authorities, they were able to convince this mainly Jewish diamond diaspora to return to the city.\n\nThe diamond sector in particular offered jobs that were compatible with the various demands of Orthodox religious life. Major diamond traders and employers, even if not highly observant, generally afforded deep respect to Jewish religious practices and customs, especially after the Holocaust. This element of the industry enhanced the city's attraction for Orthodox newcomers, especially among the most strictly Orthodox. The latter included many Hasidic groups, whose public presence in the city grew increasingly visible in the post-war decades. By the 1950s the percentage of Jews who worked in diamonds and the percentage of Jewish children who attended Jewish day schools were both estimated at about 80%. Such cohesion remains high today, and the percentages for education remain comparable. Nonetheless, the decline in Antwerp's diamond sector brings into question whether the Orthodox Jewish community will be able to reorient itself economically and thus whether Antwerp will remain the remarkable center for Orthodox (and ultra-Orthodox) Jewish life that it has been in post-war Western Europe.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Aust, Cornelia.** \"Narrative jüdischer Wirtschaftsgeschichte in Osteuropa \\[Narratives of Jewish Economic History in Eastern Europe\\],\" in _Zwischen Graetz und Dubnow_. _Jüdische Historiographie in Ostmitteleuropa im 19. und 20.

This paradox is not hard to explain: Jews’ historically disproportionate role in commerce and finance has been a source of embarrassed silence for some scholars and eager exaggeration for others, largely depending on one’s attitude to capitalism and readiness to associate it prominently with Jews.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The year at The Katz Center devoted to “Jews, Commerce and Culture” had the ambitious aim of reconstituting the study of Jews and economy on grounds that are less ideological and teleological. The emphasis on “commerce” aimed to defuse apologetics by confronting the most controversial feature of the Jews’ economic past head on. Here the overarching question was whether and how commerce can serve as a useful category for linking local Jewish communities and events across a wide geographical and chronological expanse. At the same time, the prominence in the title given to “culture” was meant to underscore the truth that economics is not solely materialist and quantitative in nature but is rather an integral part of the larger fabric of Jewish religion and folkways.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The papers presented in the weekly seminars and concluding colloquium (a number of which are represented in this web exhibit) reflected this eclectic outlook. Studies of Jewish business failure sought to counteract - or at least complicate - prevailing stereotypes of inevitable commercial triumph; analyses of transnational philanthropic efforts exposed the complex interrelationship between Jewish commercial and communal networks; while explorations of Jews’ consumption practices inverted the more typical focus on Jews as sellers. These and the other innovative approaches adopted during the year suggest that the moment is ripe to bring economic matters into closer alignment with Jewish Studies as a whole.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jonathan Karp\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"interested-parties-thomas-aquinas-john-pacham-and-gerard-of-aberville-on-usury\">Interested Parties: Thomas Aquinas, John Pacham, and Gerard of Aberville on Usury\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Joseph Shatzmiller\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/interested-parties-thomas-aquinas-john-pacham-and?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/shatzmiller-68r.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/interested-parties-thomas-aquinas-john-pacham-and?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/shatzmiller-68v.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/interested-parties-thomas-aquinas-john-pacham-and?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/shatzmiller-69r.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the Fall of 2008, the Penn Libraries acquired a Latin codex of the turn of the 14th century (Ms. Codex 1271), a collection of short works by Thomas Aquinas [1225 - 1274].

Isaac of Corbeil authored his halakhic work the Amudei Gola (Pillars of Exile) popularly known as Semak (an acronym for Sefer Misvot Katan) circa 1276-1277. The raison d’être of the book was to strengthen religious observance of the commandments relevant to Jews living in the Diaspora. This was not a work written for scholars but rather one that whose purpose was to promote piety amongst the nation. In order to facilitate weekly study of his work he divided it into seven sections (pillars).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In a letter that Isaac circulated to the Jewish communities of France we learn how he acted to promote his book. He proposed that every community keep a copy of his work available for any one who wishes to copy it, even suggesting that they allocate funds that would allow the scribe to spend time in the community while copying the book. This is the only known example from medieval Ashkenaz of an author acting to promote his work. It is difficult to ascertain whether any community actually followed the dictates of the good Rabbi, nevertheless, it is quite clear that his book was one of the most popular halakhic books ever written in Northern France. Close to 200 medieval manuscripts survive till this day that bear witness to the immense popularity of the work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"memorial-der-tugend-by-johann-von-schwarzenberg\">”Memorial der Tugend” by Johann von Schwarzenberg\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Michael Toch\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/memorial-der-tugend-johann-von-schwarzenberg?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/toch.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This exquisitely crafted pen drawing comes from an early 16th century volume depicting edifying morality tales through episodes from the Bible and antique and medieval times.

Established by a special charter, the so-called Livornina, in 1593 (see image at left), the community was organized as a merchant “company.” Subsidized by an enormous government loan, this corporation had special customs and tax privileges, its own recognized courts, and the right to admit (or refuse entry) to whomever it wished. The Medici rulers saw Jewish Sephardic merchants as a powerful force in Mediterranean trade and expected them to give Tuscany improved commercial access to the Ottoman Levant, Muslim North Africa, and (through converso relatives and contacts) the commercial network that radiated out from Spain and Portugal to encompass the entire globe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Livorno was then little more than a fishing village, filled with sailors, soldiers, thieves and prostitutes, and surrounded by malarial marshes. The Medici were investing huge sums in the town and its port facilities because the older port at Pisa, a few miles up the coast, had silted up and become unusable for sea-going vessels. The Livornina charter (and the letters sent out to advertise it) clearly assume that the wealthy merchants would live in Pisa and use Livorno only as a shipping point. To everyone’s surprise, however, it was Livorno that grew rapidly, and the Jewish community there soon outstripped its “mother colony” demanding jurisdictional and economic independence. While the growth of Livorno’s Jewry was undoubtedly motivated by merchants’ desire to live conveniently near the harbor, it seems that the younger community was initiated by quite a different group of settlers..\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From the start it was clear that not all Jews were Sephardim (that is, of Iberian origin), nor were they all merchants. Italian Jewry of the era included many whose families had lived on the Peninsula for centuries, as well as thousands of recent immigrants from all over northern and western Europe. In many of the Italian states, government policy was becoming more restrictive towards Jews: outright expulsions or at least ghettoizations, were forcing Jews to move from place to place seeking haven and economic opportunity. Inevitably, some of these Jews appealed to the massari (communal stewards) in Pisa for admission, but the latter were unwilling to admit “undesirables” - that is, those likely to tarnish the image of Jews as wealthy and powerful merchants. Refused entry into the community of Pisa, some of these Jews appealed directly to the Medici for individual admission into Livorno.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Displayed here are the title page, first page with benediction, and pages 82v-83r of a vellum manuscript, volume 1 of Codex 266, in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at the University of Pennsylvania. This volume was intended as the official reference copy of the Statuti della Dogana, the regulations of the customs house at Livorno, reformed in 1565. Blank pages were left at the end so that any important new ruling could be added.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One such ruling was issue in September of 1593 in answer to the petition by David Sacerdote, a Spanish Jew, and Isache de Goilo, a Jew from Rome, for permission to settle in Livorno with their families, to open a new- and used-clothing shop in the town, and to travel around the Medici state buying up used goods that they could sell in their shop. Asked for his opinion, the governor of Livorno responded positively, both as to the usefulness of the shop and as to the desirability of another two families coming to settle in the town, especially since they might attract others. He did have some worries, however. The shop might become an outlet for stolen property and so the Jews would have to agree to present any used item to the customs officials before putting it on sale. The trade in used items must not be used to cover a money-lending operation. The shop should not be allowed to trade in woolen cloths since that would compete with the recently licensed woolens manufacture in the city. Grand Duke Ferdinando agreed with the governor, licensing the shop under the general terms described (though restricting used clothing purchases to the area immediately around Pisa and Livorno), and freeing the partners and their wives from the obligation to wear the Jewish badge, from customs duties and taxes, and from prosecution for past debts incurred elsewhere. Thus the petitioners were granted almost all of the privileges of the Pisan community even though they were not part of it and had to be registered individually in Livorno.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Historians are often hesitant to describe the Jewish “rigattieri” and “straccieri” - the rag dealers and second-hand shopkeepers who were so much a feature of the Jewish economy in past centuries. By euphemistically and narrowly referring only to the wealthier “bankers,” historians paint a picture of elegant financiers who are often also the cultural elite of their community. But Jewish “banks” were for the most part indistinguishable from what we now call pawnshops, serving, then as now, the marginal elements of society. This was a profitable, if risky and not particularly esteemed, profession, but it was one of the few available to Jews of sixteenth century Italy. It was the kind of activity that attracted Jews to the port of Livorno where a transient and often disreputable population often needed quick cash without too many questions asked. We can easily understand why wealthier Jewish merchants did not want to be associated with pawnbrokers and rag dealers. But government officials understood the economic need for such services, and in the frontier conditions of Livorno any settler, even a Jew, was to be valued. It was from such aggressive businessmen that the Jewish community of Livorno was to grow.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"transnational-philanthropic-systems-in-the-early-modern-jewish-world-the-eastern-european-jewish-refugee-crisis-of-the-mid-seventeenth-century\">Transnational Philanthropic Systems in the Early Modern Jewish World: The Eastern European Jewish Refugee Crisis of the Mid-Seventeenth Century\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Adam Teller\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/transnational-philanthropic-systems-early-modern?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Teller-Bergeron-Tatars.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/transnational-philanthropic-systems-early-modern?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Teller-Bergeron-Map.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/transnational-philanthropic-systems-early-modern?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Teller-Bergeron-Title.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the Tatar forces - as depicted here in this early 18th century anthology of travel writing in French - crossed the Dniepr river to join the Cossack armies in their uprising against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1648, they set in motion a chain of events which would eventually change the map of Europe. One aspect of this was the fate of Eastern European Jewry. In the face of the massacres perpetrated first by the Cossack-Tatar forces, and later by the Swedish and Muscovite armies, many thousands of Jews fled, creating a wave of refugees not only within the Commonwealth, but also in Central and Western Europe and in the Mediterranean basin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In order to help alleviate this problem, existing regional and intra-regional philanthropic systems came into play. The Lithuanian Jewish council coordinated efforts of the communities which comprised it to help settle the refugees, particularly the elderly, women and children, and to provide them with food, shelter and an income. Vienna acted as a central clearing house for the refugees in central Europe, not only giving them a place to stay but presiding over efforts to raise money for the collapsing Jewish communities of eastern Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Eastern European Jewish refugees in the Mediterranean basin, which included a high proportion of women, were largely swept up in the huge slave trade of the region. In the mid-seventeenth century, Jewish ransoming activities were conducted according to an agreement between the communities of Venice, Livorno, and Istanbul. This agreement collapsed in the face of the wave of refugees, whose representatives found themselves in competition with those ransoming other Jewish captives and those raising money for the Jewish poor of the Land of Israel. The lion’s share of the costs of ransoming the eastern European Jews seem to have been borne by the Jews of Istanbul - a huge financial burden whose effects may have been felt for generations. In contrast, the Jews of eastern Europe managed to reconstruct their lives and their communities relatively quickly, thanks to their close co-operation with the enormously wealthy Polish magnates.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As the refugee crisis drew to an end, some Jews chose to return home to Poland-Lithuania, while others, particularly women, fearful of the dangers of travel, chose to remain where they were and start a new life. The spreading of the Polish-Lithuanian Jewish refugees as far afield as the eastern Mediterranean, the Maghreb, Central Europe and the Atlantic seaboard raised a great deal of interest among the Jewish population already settled there. This acted as a stimulus to Jewish publishing in both Hebrew and Yiddish.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In somewhat similar fashion, the great geographical discoveries of the early modern era and Europe’s colonial expansion created a thirst for knowledge about distant places and peoples in many European countries. In response, anthologies of travel literature became a highly popular genre. The images shown here illustrate one such travel anthology - Voyages faits principalement en Asie dans les XII, XIII, XIV, et XV siecles, published by Pieter van der Aa, La Haye 1735. This book reprinted the work of the seventeenth century French geographer, Pierre de Bergeron (1580-1657), who translated into French a number of travel narratives (including that of the Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela). The images shown here illustrated a text entitled, l’Histoire des Mongols appelés par nous Tartares, description des coutumes, de la géographie, de l’histoire et des figures marquantes du peuple mongol, which was originally written by the Papal legate to the Mongol Khans, Giovanni dal Piano dei Carpini (in French, Jean du Plan Carpin) in the thirteenth century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"don-francisco-de-quevedo-and-the-myth-of-jewish-world-finance\">Don Francisco de Quevedo and the myth of Jewish world finance\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Carsten Wilke\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/wilke.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>In a chapter of his political satire called The Hour of All Men (La hora de todos), the Spanish classic Francisco de Quevedo invented around 1635 one of the central myths of modern anti-semitism: Jewish finance controls the world by means of the trans-national credit market. In this fanciful conspiracy plot, representatives of twelve major Jewish centers congregate in the Ottoman port of Salonica in order to receive a delegation of Machiavelian politicians from the Spanish government. Both sides agree to abolish Christianity and to replace it with the cult of money. The Jewish bankers vaunt that they have submitted the warfaring European powers by entangling them into an “indissoluble knot” of financial interdependence, in which Dutch fleets are armed with trading profits from Spain, and Spanish batallions raised with credit from Amsterdam stocks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Quevedo superimposes a medieval religious stereotype to the unsettling economic realities created in the early seventeenth century by the first appearance of negotiable stocks, the stock exchange, central banks and a world wide trade in debts. The Portuguese Jewish merchants, whose dealings he satirizes, neither invented nor monopolized these instruments of financial rationality, but they used them at an early stage in the framework of what has been considered as the first global trading diaspora in modern history.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Hour of All Men was printed under a pseudonym in 1650, the fifth edition, displayed here, being the first to mention the author’s name.

(Image, left, top, shows the author’ introduction and the first page.) This enormously popular demonologically-charged mystical ethical book was reprinted dozens upon dozens of times in Hebrew, produced in a bilingual Hebrew and Yiddish version by the author, and eventually translated into Ladino. Many of its admonitions and Zoharic excerpts appear aimed at traveling merchants, warning of the ethical pitfalls they might encounter on their journeys. The small dimensions of the book would seem to confirm this authorial intent. Koidanover was born in Vilna and raised in Kurów (near Lublin). He moved to Nikolsburg (Moravia) after 1655 and then settled in Frankfurt am Main in 1667. He later returned to Vilna, where he prospered but was imprisoned. He returned permanently to Frankfurt in 1696. His observations thus reflect the inner life of Jews in the Polish, Czech, and German lands.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The pages reproduced here reflect the fascinating relationship between Jews and alcohol. By the end of the eighteenth century about 80 percent of rural Jews in Poland-Lithuania were involved in the sale and production of liquor. According to available data, Jews comprised 94 percent of urban and at least 78.7 percent of rural tavern keepers among seven towns and fifty-one villages in Bielsk County (Podlaskie District) during this period. A centerpiece of the reform initiatives of the Prussian, Russian, and Austrian monarchs who annexed the Polish lands during this period was the elimination of the rural Jewish liquor trade, which they attempted by means of escalating concession fees and outright expulsions. Surprisingly, few rabbinic or Hasidic leaders protested these draconian measures. It appears they themselves were uncomfortable with the tavern keeping profession. An excerpt from Kav ha-yashar (see images, left, middle) illustrates this ambivalence:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>When one builds a house or designates a special room in one’s house for the uncircumcised to come and drink, party, and fornicate, a common sin which many have committed in Poland and Lithuania, and which no one prohibits: In such a case the spirit of defilement will certainly settle upon the house and the one who built it will not leave this world until he is punished through that very house.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Why was the Polish nobility so inclined to lease its taverns and distilleries to Jews in the first place? Among the several explanations supplied by historians is the notion of Jewish sobriety: Jewish tavern keepers, in contrast to their Christian counterparts, tended not to drink up their profits. The following excerpt from Kav ha-yashar (see image, left, bottom) gives pause to such assumptions:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>I have noticed that many people in this region are so enslaved to their appetites that immediately upon awakening, hours before dawn, they believe they will die if they do not drink liquor. And they think that it is perfectly permissible to indulge their lusts and stubborn hearts. And sometimes they drink to the point of intoxication. And afterwards, when the time of morning prayer arrives, their prayer is not fluent. And this is a terrible sin, which many luminaries have committed.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Nevertheless, we cannot conclude that alcoholism was a widespread problem in Jewish society. Such admonitions occur infrequently in ethical literature; while Slavic folk sayings reflect a widespread perception of Jewish sobriety during this period. There may still be something to the hypothesis!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"in-dispute-commerce-commercial-courts-and-bills-of-exchange\">In Dispute: Commerce, Commercial Courts, and Bills of Exchange\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Cornelia Aust\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/dispute-commerce-commercial-courts-and-bills?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aust-title.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/dispute-commerce-commercial-courts-and-bills?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aust-front.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/dispute-commerce-commercial-courts-and-bills?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aust-bill1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/dispute-commerce-commercial-courts-and-bills?item=3\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aust-bill2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is the front page of Paul Jacob Marperger’s work on the usefulness and duties of the newly-founded commercial council in Prussia. Marperger (1656-1730) was the son of a German officer but took an apprenticeship with a French trading house. He became one of the first German writers on issues of mercantilism, cameralism, and commercial practices. In this and numerous other works he discussed the importance and the obligations of the mercantilist state. He examined the mechanisms of commerce, commercial courts, different commercial laws and regulations, bills of exchange and a wide array of similar topics. In 1708, he became a member of the Prussian Society of the Sciences and in 1724, he was appointed to the Royal Court and Commerce Council of Poland and the Electorate of Saxony.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The title page is accompanied by a copper engraving that depicts the members of the commercial council holding an open book with the inscription Fides et Veritas [Faith and Truth] across from a group of merchants who bring forward complaints and appeals to the council. In the background, a number of merchants are sitting around a table with different writing utensils, probably drawing a contract, while outside the window one recognizes the sea with incoming ships, a covered market building, an open market space, merchants, coaches, as well as barrels and packs of merchandize. A scroll on top of the picture names some of the most important places of commerce in Europe: Amsterdam, Bordeaux, Breslau, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Leipzig, Nuremberg, Lyon, and Venice. While Jewish merchants do not figure prominently in Marpergerb’s work, they took a very active part in the commerce of early modern Europe and were regular visitors of fairs. Specific commercial courts became more and more a necessity with the growing volume of trade and the increase of complicated credit actions that were facilitated through bills of exchange. In Leipzig, which held one of the most important fairs, a commercial court was founded in 1682 because the municipal courts were overwhelmed with the amount and intricacy of the cases brought before it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Though bills of exchange have existed since the Middle Ages, they became more suitable for long-distance trade and the provision of credit, which both were closely intertwined, in the early modern period with the general acceptance of the endorsement on the back of the bill. This allowed circulating a bill of exchange as currency which made bill transactions more flexible. This bill of exchange was issued in Warsaw in 1790 by a non-Jewish merchant to the Jewish banker Simon Symons from Amsterdam. It could be redeemed two months later from the Christian banking house Eichborn &#x26; Co. in Breslau.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the back, one can see how it went through the hands of six different Christian and Jewish merchants and bankers and from Warsaw to Hamburg and Berlin before the bill was met in Breslau. However, the use of bills of exchange and especially their wide circulation had to be based on trust since everyone in the chain who paid (in cash or goods) had to rely not only on the previous endorser but on the original drawer or on every person involved in the chain of circulation. False bills of exchange were not a rarity and it was not uncommon that an original drawer had no credit with the payer. Thus, commercial courts that were competent to deal with complicated matters of bills and commerce were regarded as crucial by Marperger and others.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"sephardic-merchant-trade\">Sephardic Merchant Trade\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Evelyne Oliel-Grausz\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/olielgrauz.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>This bill of lading, drawn up in 1771, describes the cargo shipped from Newport to Surinam by Aaron Lopez, a Sephardi merchant who lived as a New Christian in Portugal until 1752 when he fled Lisbon to join his brother in Newport. During the following decade, in the context of the French and Indian war, Lopez expanded the scope of his mercantile activities to Western Europe, the Caribbean, Newfoundland, Africa, and when this document was drawn up he had become one of Newport’s leading merchants.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Several features of early modern commerce may be emphasized using this document, which belongs to the Library at the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, but which is one of many preserved in Aaron Lopez’s papers, seized after his premature death (1782) in order to assess his indebtedness. The most striking feature is the variety of commodities composing this cargo. Even if Lopez is known for his contribution to the trade in spermaceti (the head matter of the sperm whale used in the manufacturing of candles), which does not appear in this cargo, this document epitomizes the nature of early modern trade, generally not specialized but, rather, organized along routes, the merchants trading in whatever wares are available or in demand and likely to bring about a profit: here together with naval stores, construction materials (bricks), we have items related to cooperage, (hogsheads, i.e., barrel staves or hoops, dismantled barrels,…), horses, pieces of furniture, tobacco, as well as a variety of foods intended for different groups of consumers: pork, butter, herring, but also kosher foods, “Jew beef,” “Casher Fatt,” “Casher Tongues.” Thus, together with the standard routes and products of colonial trade, the sub-species of kosher trade features here prominently.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Aaron Lopez was providing similar wares to other Caribbean communities, namely Jamaica and Curaçao. This bill mentions that Aaron Lopez owns the brig - therefore no freight is to be paid - and not only the merchandise. Around 1772, Aaron Lopez owned about twenty ships. Another essential actor of this maritime trade appears here with the figure of the Captain: much of the enterprise rested on the Captain’s skills and a trusting relationship between him and the merchant was essential to a successful venture, for which the captain was often rewarded with a commission on top of his salary.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The goods mentioned in this cargo are sent to Surinam, a Dutch possession, plausibly to Jewish and non-Jewish correspondents. This consignment is but one aspect of the links between Jewish communities in colonial America: a few years earlier, for instance, the Surinam Portuguese community had agreed to make a substantial donation to help the congregation Yeshuat Israel of Newport complete the building of its synagogue. Merchant networks, though implicit in this document, do not feature directly in it: Lopez’s partners, in Newport, London or the Caribbean comprised Jews and non-Jews, Askenazi and Sephardi merchants. Other essential aspects of Aaron Lopez’s mercantile activities do not appear here, such as his involvement in the slave trade, but should be recalled in order to understand the scope and nature of his mercantile activities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"going-for-broke-traité-des-faillites-et-banqueroutes\">Going for Broke: Traité des Faillites et Banqueroutes\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jessica Roitman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/roitman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Traité des Faillites et Banqueroutes, written in the early 19th century, is one of the first attempts to collect and codify bankruptcy laws both in France and through Europe. Until then, bankruptcy law had been a hodgepodge of local, regional, national, and common law. This effort was an implicit recognition of what had been clear since time immemorial - merchants could and did renege on their debts, leading themselves and their entire business networks into insolvency. In short, networks could and did fail.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sephardic networks were as prone to disintegration as any other. A close look at the archival documentation of the Amsterdam Sephardic community paints a picture of fractiousness, dissent, religious unrest, and civil lawsuits. This reality challenges the conventional wisdom of the efficiency of Jewish trade networks based on family, kinship, and shared ethno-religious background. In fact, Sephardic traders in 17th century Amsterdam often brought each other to ruin, either through bad luck, ineptitude, or malfeasance. Their tightly-woven networks only exacerbated the domino effect if one merchant failed. Sephardic merchants were as likely as any other to declare bankruptcy in civil court, and depend on the law, such as it was, to decide their fate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ludwig-börne-and-the-predicament-of-jewish-class-relations\">Ludwig Börne and the predicament of Jewish class relations\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Adam Sutcliffe\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sutcliffe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Ludwig Börne was born - as Juda Löw Baruch - in 1786 into a wealthy banking family in the Frankfurt Ghetto. In 1811, taking advantage of the Napoleonic emancipatory legislation, he took a position in the administration of Frankfurt’s police records. In 1815, when these laws was revoked, Börne lost his job. For the rest of his life, despite his conversion to Protestantism in 1819, he made his living as an outsider: a freelance writer, journalist and political radical. He rushed to Paris when revolution broke out there in July 1830, and lived there almost continually, in effective exile, until his death in 1837.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Börne decisively rejected his religious upbringing, and his writings include plenty of hostile comments about Jews, and particularly about Jewish commerce. However, far from being a ‘self-hating Jew,’ Börne was keenly aware of the Jews’ political vulnerability. He understood this, however, within a wider context of class relations between the ruling elite and the oppressed masses, between whom the Jews, because of their intermediary economic role, were precariously squeezed, serving elites as a protective shield. Börne’s political thought was characterized by a striking clarity concerning power relations in society, an engaged realism, a commitment to economic and political justice, and a loosely messianic sense of impending transformation. In all of these aspects his ideas were profoundly shaped by his Jewish background.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-cheap-jewish-library\">The Cheap Jewish Library\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Adam Mendelsohn\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/cheap-jewish-library?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/mendelsohn-cheap.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/cheap-jewish-library?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/mendelsohn-misc-days.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-commerce-culture/cheap-jewish-library?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/mendelsohn-misc-perez.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the middle of the nineteenth century, publishers in the United States and England began to court a mass Jewish market, producing literature - newspapers, tracts, catechisms, novels, and Bibles - for distribution cheaply and in large quantities. This trend was partly a result of the falling costs of printing. Yet its initial driving impulse came from missionary publishers rather than Jewish sources. Christian Evangelicals were among the first to grasp the implications of mass publishing, skillfully utilizing the printing press to communicate with their followers and win new converts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The scale and persistence of mission efforts to supply Jews in America and England with their literature galvanized a Jewish response. While this response was undoubtedly defensive, it also reflected a new awareness of pent-up demand among Jews for books, tracts, pamphlets, printed sermons, and Bibles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Cheap Jewish Library - the name echoed the immensely popular evangelical Cheap Repository Tracts - was started and subsidized anonymously by Charlotte Montefiore and her sister Louisa de Rothschild, daughters of the aristocratic Jewish cousinhood, in London in 1841. (David Aaron de Sola, the hazan at Bevis Marks handled the practicalities of publication.) Single-page tracts were sold for a penny - tantamount to giving them away - with the intention of reaching the “humbler classes” to provide “instruction by means of interesting tales.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The cheap tracts were intended to rival the flood of moralistic material that gushed from the presses of the interdenominational Religious Tract Society and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. These and other publishing houses produced millions of tracts annually, saturating the reading public with a ceaseless tide of uplifting tales and exhortations that conveyed lessons in Christian faith and virtue. While Jewish writers had produced plenty of polemical anti-missionary works before the 1840s, the mass produce pamphlets produced under the Cheap Jewish Library imprint contained a more subtle counter conversionist agenda.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Like their Christian counterparts, the tracts tended towards saccharine stories, often barely concealing a core of “doctrinal information,” Biblical and Jewish history. The tales were written by a roster of writers that included Grace Aguilar. Her serialized Perez Family, for example, depicted the evil consequences of irreligion and intermarriage. The patrician project also imparted “practical lessons for the everyday life”: thinly disguised lectures on hygiene, decorum and comportment. The Cheap Jewish Library proved far more palatable on both sides of the Atlantic than some of the rival series produced under Jewish auspices. Isaac Leeser was an early and enthusiastic supporter of the series. His Jewish Publication Society, founded in Philadelphia in 1845, reprinted tracts from the Cheap Jewish Library under the Jewish Miscellany imprint.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"economies-of-dress-and-social-satire\">Economies of Dress and Social Satire\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Marcin Wodzinski\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/wodzinski.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Negative attitudes towards Hasidism held by 19th century Jewish enlighteners, known in Hebrew as “maskilim,” found expression not only in numerous and well known literary texts, such as the satires by Josef Perl, but also in visual images. One of the best examples is a drawing published by Leon Hollanderski (or Hollenderski), a Polish Jew sympathetic to the ideas of the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) and, after 1831, a political émigré in France. In 1845 Hollanderski published in Paris his Les Israelites de Pologne, the very first history of Polish Jews written by a Jewish author. One of the charts in the book depicts “Le Chasside et sa femme,” which is today one of the best known nineteenth-century images of a Hasid.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, this widely known drawing is far from neutral and, in fact, should be understood as a kind of caricature of the Hasidic movement. First of all, one should bear in mind that the elements that todaybo?=s reader tends to understand as Hasidic dress were, in fact, common for most, if not all, nineteenth-century Polish Jews. For example, the spodek (tall fur hat), the kapote (long dark coat), and even the slippers (instead of boots) are not distinctive in themselves. Possibly, the only clearly Hasidic elements of dress that the image depicts are white undergarments and a gartel (wide belt). What, then, is Hasidic about the depicted Hasid? Hollanderski characterizes him by three distinctive social elements: (1) a shabby beard suggesting an untidiness allegedly typical for all the Hasidim; (2) a lulke (long pipe) referring to a well-known Hasidic attraction to tobacco; (3) a red nose and a bottle of brandy in hand referring to a Hasidic custom of drinking tikun (a sacred toast), also reflecting a popular accusation made by maskilim about Hasidic abuses of alcohol. Though each of these elements referred to some historical reality, none of them was accurate and neutral. Together they produced a highly biased and ideologically loaded portrait of a Hasid and, by implication, Hasidism.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"jewish-transnational-philanthropy-and-politics-theory-and-practice\">Jewish Transnational Philanthropy and Politics: Theory and Practice\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jonathan Dekel-Chen\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dekelchen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Cain may have been the first to ask, “Am I my Brother’s Keeper?” but Jews in different lands have answered this question in different ways over the millennia. Their brotherly actions on behalf of those in need have included the giving of charity, the organization of welfare services, reconstruction projects, intercession with governments and the mobilization of public opinion. Over the last 150 years, one of the consistent targets of this Jewish transnational intercession has been East European Jewry, where the knowledge of the repression and impoverishment against their brethren has sparked Jews in Western Europe and the Americas to action.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This pamphlet, part of the holdings of the Library at the Katz Center at Penn, was published by the Russo-Jewish Committee of British Jewry in 1891; it attempted to draw public attention among English-speakers everywhere to the plight of Russia’s Jews. Historians may still argue about the degree to which this, and subsequent, mobilizations in the Jewish world pushed the Russian and Soviet regimes toward improving their treatment of Jews. Whatever the outcome of these scholarly debates, it is nonetheless true that efforts like these forced the issue of Russian and Soviet Jewry closer to the news headlines and the global agenda than otherwise would have been the case.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"dreyfus-was-not-alone-jewish-officers-in-the-french-army\">Dreyfus Was Not Alone: Jewish Officers in the French Army\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Derek Penslar\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/penslar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>However extraordinary the Dreyfus Affair may have been, in many ways Captain Alfred Dreyfus was typical of hundreds of Jews who served as career officers in the French military in the late 1800s. Like most of his peers, Dreyfus attended the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique, which trained civilian engineers as well as officers for the artillery and engineering corps. Dreyfus then attended the recently established Ecole Supérieure de Guerre, as did several other Jews who went on to long and successful military careers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From the mid 1800s through 1930s, military careers were important sources of social mobility for French Jewish men. Jewish army officers often came from humble backgrounds (Dreyfus was an exception) but thanks to the prestige of a military commission, Jewish officers married women from well-to-do families and enjoyed considerable prestige in their communities. At times Jewish officers parlayed their military expertise into business success, particularly in French Indochina.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dreyfus’ downfall came when he entered the newly revamped General Staff, where old notions of advancement through noble birth and family connections were challenged by new demands for meritocracy. Although Dreyfus was not the first or only Jewish senior staff officer in the French army, he was the first to serve in the new General Staff. Even here, many of his colleagues thought well of him, but resentment built up against the wealthy, brilliant and somewhat arrogant young officer. Dreyfus’ zeal and excellent memory, combined with his being a Jew from Alsace, lent credence to the unjust accusation in October of 1894 that Dreyfus was a German spy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"kosher-margarine\">Kosher Margarine\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Gideon Reuveni\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/reuveni-palmin.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Featured here is an advertisement for Palmin margarine in a Jewish cockbook from 1909. Palmin was developed by the German chemist Dr. Heinrich Schlinck (1840-1909) at the end of the 19th century as a substitute for animal-based cooking fats. The name Palmin denotes the origin of the product from coconut, that is palm tree. Since margarine was manufactured from vegetable fat, it could be used in cooking both meat and dairy dishes. Before the Great War Palmin, along side another margarine that was manufactured by the firm H. Schlinck &#x26; Cie. by the name of Palmona, was marketed as a Kosher brand allowing the Jewish kitchen to broaden its range of tastes by using new recipes previously prohibited by the laws of kashrut. Palmin was not the only kosher vegetable butter at that time. Another well-known kosher margarine was “Tomor,” which was produced by Van den Bergh, a Dutch food corporation, at their German branch in the Kleve. Van den Bergh’s founder the Dutch industrialist, Simon Van den Bergh (1819-1907), was an observant Jew.

For years these “banks” had not only kept immigrant Jews’ small deposits, but also helped them buy ship tickets for their loved ones in Europe and transfer money back there. Unable to return depositors’ funds, New York State’s Bank Superintendent forced one of the largest banks on New York’s Lower East side, Sender Jarmulowsky’s bank, founded in 1873 and claiming over 60,000 depositors, to shutter its doors. On August 30, 1914, the largest financially-driven riot in New York City history to date broke out in front of Jarmulovsky’s bank. Demanding the bank return their deposits, the enraged crowd of East European Jews paraded to City Hall where they attacked clerks, forcing police to arrest nine and use clubs to quell rest. The riot frightened city officials, who assigned the city’s revered judge, Learned Hand, to settle the claims. Hand soon uncovered that the bank’s assets were all tied up in real estate speculation in East Harlem. The incident provoked a myriad of court cases, Hand to write precedent-setting judicial decisions and city officials to craft new banking legislation to protect New York from becoming infected with “speculitis,” a disease all agreed was transforming not only New York but America itself.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While few today recognize the name Jarmulowsky or can identify this family’s bank - nicknamed “the Temple of Capitalism,” the building still stands on the corner of Canal street and East Broadway. This bank and its failure highlight a fascinating aspect of the American economy in the early-twentieth century: while East European Jews occupied marginal (and often disreputable) niches in the businesses of shipping and banking and invited suspicion from large portions of society, they nonetheless were able to move into the mainstream sectors of the economy in a comparatively brief time span by acquiring substantial capital through their risky ventures.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"are-you-your-brothers-keeper\">Are you your brother’s keeper?\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/jewish-relief.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>With powerful photographs and a compelling bilingual text, this 1922 poster urges the Jews of Philadelphia - many of them of East European origin - to come to the aid of their suffering brethren, whose lives had been devastated by World War I and its aftermath. While the images display the Jews’ suffering, the Yiddish headline asks boldly: “ARE THEY YOUR KIN?” and the anser is “Your brothers, your sisters, your dearests will die if you are unable to help them.” The text ends with a dramatic declaration: “THEIR LIVES ARE IN YOUR HANDS.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The poster also reflects the rising dominance of American Jewry and the parallel waning of the influence and power of European Jewish philanthropists. This shift in authority and clout was accelerated by The Great War of 1914-1918, continued throughout the interwar years, and came to its tragic conclusion during the Holocaust.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Immediately after the outbreak of WWI, American Jews began sending money to help the Jews of Europe (and the small Jewish community in Palestine). These efforts quickly evolved into well-organized nationwide fundraising campaigns. New philanthropic organizations were established, prominent among them the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (the “Joint”) and tens of millions of dollars were collected in just a few years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Two words that appear at the bottom of the poster reflect two distinct ideologies that guided American Jewry’s aid to European Jews. The term “Relief” relates to charitable activities, spanning from medical aid to soup kitchens. The term “Reconstruction” refers to a system that promoted self help. The desire to help East European and Zionist Jews to help themselves dominated Jewish philanthropic initiatives in the USA. “Reconstruction” helped Jews in Poland, Romania and even in the Soviet Union rebuilt their lives in the post-1918 world and gave them hope. Stalin’s purges of Jewish life, including the Jewish agricultural settlements in the Crimea and Southern Ukraine established by the Joint (“Agro-Joint”), and the Holocaust brought the Reconstruction efforts to a tragic halt.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"shtraymels-under-the-railroad-bridge---antwerp-jews-orthodoxy-and-diamonds\">Shtraymels under the railroad bridge - Antwerp Jews, Orthodoxy, and Diamonds\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Veerle Vanden Daelen\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102413im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/daelen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Two Hasidic men on their bikes, stopping under the railroad bridge to chat: this is an everyday scene in Antwerp, especially in the neighborhood close to the central railway station and the diamond district. Within this so-called Jewish neighborhood lives a high concentration of Antwerp’s (mainly) Orthodox Jewish population, along with non-Jewish inhabitants.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since the end of the nineteenth century the number of Jews in Antwerp has risen considerably (ca. 1,200 in 1880 to 35,500 in 1939). The diamond trade, which expanded parallel with the influx of Jewish immigrants, attracted a rising number of Jewish newcomers and became the economic motor of Jewish life in the city. When things went well in diamonds, Jewish life flourished. But when the diamond business entered periods of crisis, Jewish institutions and organizations were the first to notice and be affected. Jews occupied key positions in the management of the diamond industry and newcomers could advance far within it, often in a relatively short time. All sorts of Jewish life - Orthodox, Zionist, Communist, Socialist, etc. - were visible around the diamond district and the adjacent Jewish neighborhood.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Second World War and the persecution and annihilation of Jews devastated Antwerp’s Jewish life. Approximately 65 percent of Antwerp’s registered Jewish population was deported, and few survived. Just before and during the war a considerable number of people in the diamond sector fled the country. The major destinations for this resultant diamond diaspora were London, New York, and South America. That Jewish life exists today in Antwerp has much to do with the wartime preparations of the former Antwerp mayor and two Jewish diamond merchants in exile in London. They began planning for the diamond industry’s return to Antwerp already during the war. With the eagerness and the efforts of the Belgian and local Antwerp authorities, they were able to convince this mainly Jewish diamond diaspora to return to the city.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The diamond sector in particular offered jobs that were compatible with the various demands of Orthodox religious life. Major diamond traders and employers, even if not highly observant, generally afforded deep respect to Jewish religious practices and customs, especially after the Holocaust. This element of the industry enhanced the city’s attraction for Orthodox newcomers, especially among the most strictly Orthodox. The latter included many Hasidic groups, whose public presence in the city grew increasingly visible in the post-war decades. By the 1950s the percentage of Jews who worked in diamonds and the percentage of Jewish children who attended Jewish day schools were both estimated at about 80%. Such cohesion remains high today, and the percentages for education remain comparable. Nonetheless, the decline in Antwerp’s diamond sector brings into question whether the Orthodox Jewish community will be able to reorient itself economically and thus whether Antwerp will remain the remarkable center for Orthodox (and ultra-Orthodox) Jewish life that it has been in post-war Western Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Aust, Cornelia.\u003C/strong> “Narrative jüdischer Wirtschaftsgeschichte in Osteuropa [Narratives of Jewish Economic History in Eastern Europe],” in \u003Cem>Zwischen Graetz und Dubnow\u003C/em>. \u003Cem>Jüdische Historiographie in Ostmitteleuropa im 19. und 20.

Though rooted in neurological and physical responses, our scholars showed how emotions like love, anger, anxiety, joy, fear, empathy, sympathy, sadness, desire, pain, and pleasure are shaped by culture. Among the questions they posed are: how are we to explore and better understand emotions in Jewish cultural and political contexts? Are there distinctively Jewish aspects of universal human experiences of sensation - sight, sound, touch, or scent? What does Jewish thought have to say about the non-rational dimensions of Jewish philosophy and embodied spirituality beyond reason? Discussions of experiences of suffering, bereavement, distrust, art, architecture, photography, sexual desire, Jewish thought, ethics (musar), law (halakhah), psychoanalysis, trauma and culture, and New Age Judaism in the modern State of Israel, all form part of this year's exhibition.\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### Holy Fire\n\nJames A. Diamond\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/diamond900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe agony bled by the sermons delivered by the Warsaw Ghetto Rebbe, Rabbi Kalonymous Kalman Shapira, and collected under the title Holy Fire, coagulates as the meeting ground in an unbridgeable distance between a divine vista and a human void. They are, without a doubt, a testament to the \"life\" lived beyond reason that the eminent philosopher Emil Fackenheim insisted Jewish thought after the Shoah must \"go to school with.\" The account of the ten rabbinic martyrs, including most famously Rabbi Akiva, tortured and killed by the Romans, must forever be recounted in the shadow of the Rebbe's challenge to God just as the deportations from the Ghetto to the death camps begin:\n\n\"In truth it is incredible that the world continues to exist despite so many screams as these. For it is said that the Ten Martyrs provoked so many screams from the angels declaring this is Torah and this is its reward? Then a voice from heaven threatened, if I hear one more sound I shall turn the world into water. Now that innocent, angelic, pure children as well as great Jewish saints, who are even greater than angels, are being killed and slaughtered only because they are Jews, are filling the entire space of the world with these screams, and the world has not reverted to water, continues to exist as if nothing has affected it?\"\n\n### Neue Synagoge Berlin (1866)\n\nJohn M. Efron\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/facade.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/nave.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nWhen inaugurated in 1866, the Neue Synagoge on the Oranienburgerstrasse in Berlin was the biggest, costliest, and easily the most conspicuous synagogue in Europe, if not the world. It was also the most spectacular example of neo-Moorish synagogue architecture. The exterior was a mixture of Islamic and Romanesque elements that deployed yellow masonry through which ran horizontal stripes of red brick. The height of the façade was 92 feet while the depth of the synagogue was 308 feet. The central entrance was flanked by two giant towers, the one on the right housing the Jewish community administration, and a library with 67,000 volumes while he tower on the left served as a Jewish museum. On the exterior, the synagogue's showpiece was the onion dome that soared majestically some 160 feet into the air. Wrapped in a blanket of zinc and swaddled in gold ribbing, crowned with a Star of David, the great dome was the brightest and most joyful architectural feature to be found anywhere in Berlin.\n\nWith seating for 3,200 worshippers, the triple nave interior was a massive 188 feet long, 126 feet wide and soared to a height of 87 feet. The entire interior was a dazzling kaleidoscope of color, light, and texture. With Moorish decorative patterns from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the floors were inlaid with intricate mosaics, the walls were covered in richly colored stucco and then painted with stars and flora, while stalactite features hung from the ceiling and geometric and honeycomb patterns were widely deployed, including on the elaborate friezes that accented the temple's interior. A technical breakthrough helped bathe the entire synagogue in a palette of many colors. The windows were double paned, with the outer windows made of clear glass and the inner windows of stained glass. An innovative system of gas lamps was installed in between the two panes throughout the synagogue, creating what one attendee at the synagogue's dedication ceremony in 1866, said was a \"magical effect.\"\n\nThe Neue Synagoge was an immediate sensation. A contemporary newspaper account vividly described the synagogue as \"a fairytale structure . . . . In the middle of a plain part of the city we are led into the fantastic wonder of the Alhambra, with graceful columns, sweeping arches, richly-colored Arabesques, abundant wood carvings, all with the thousandfold magic of the Moorish style.\" On Friday, July 19, 1867, Lewis Carroll, author of Alice in Wonderland, visited the Neue Synagoge and recorded that \"the building itself is most gorgeous, almost the whole interior surface being gilt or otherwise decorated.\" Of the service itself, Carroll observed that \"what was read was all in German, but there was a great deal chanted in Hebrew, to beautiful music: some of the chants have come down from very early times, perhaps as far back as David.\"\n\n### No Deliverance: Abel Pann—the father of the Israeli visual Akedah\n\nYael S. Feldman\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/feldman539900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nAbel Pann (1883-1963), the Latvian-born and Paris-trained artist who joined the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Mandate Palestine, is mostly known today for two thematic clusters of his work: the representation of Jewish persecution in Europe around WWI (horrific black-and-white scenes that one can hardly view today without anachronistically associating them with the Holocaust); and The Five Books of Moses (1923), a collection of colorfully idealized paintings of the Bible, drawn mostly with bright colors and verve, clearly evoking the exotic orient.\n\nNone of this applies however to the image of the _Akedah_ included in this book. This lithograph clearly lacks the brightness and life that mark the rest of the images here. It also bears no resemblance to traditional Jewish representations. With its gloomy dark green and faded, almost lifeless beiges, it seems to be the first Jewish artistic attempt to focus exclusively on the human protagonists of the scene while omitting other actors – most significantly, the deliverance duo, the angel and the ram. As such, it had established the rule of \"no deliverance\" that has since governed the Israeli grappling with the topos as a symbol of Israel's \"national sacrifice\"—its fallen soldiers.\n\nConfronted with Isaac's bound and limp body, viewers of this painting are compelled to sense its physical pain, almost Caravaggio-style (The Sacrifice of Isaac, 1605). At the same time, the image gives the impression of a great intimacy between the binder and the bound, echoing perhaps Rembrandt's famous etching (Abraham's Sacrifice, 1655). Intriguingly, it is the father's face rather than the son's that expresses here the horror of the moment (see the \"frozen\" gaze in his eyes), underlined by the sharp knife still held in his hand. Indeed, Abel Pann fashioned the scene in the name of, or from the place of the fathers of the\"Isaacs\" of his time (the turbulent 1920s); hence the intense ambivalence and even guilt expressed in his \\[self?\\]-portrayal. Tragically, he seems to have anticipated his own fate. By the time he was to return to this topos in the late 1940s and 50s he would be a bereaved father, one of many, of the Israeli War of Independence. His own beloved first-born Eldad fell in Gush-Etsion on the eve of Independence (1928-May 14, 1948)—an experience that naturally exacerbated the feelings of pain and guilt that have since marked his (and others') Akedah images by Israeli artists.\n\n### The House that Joe Built\n\nKeren Friedmen-Peleg\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Friedman-Peleg900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThere are tense relations between the paper-house built by Josef Gulka, the circulation/stack manager at the Library at the Katz Center, and the objects around it. In an environment full of texts, at least some of them rare, most of them grappling with the very essence of Judaism between past and present, his small paper-house seems out of place. It has plastic lambs on top of it, a dinosaur in the front of it, and the caption \"welcome\" above it. The paper-house subtly interferes with the task-oriented interaction a patron might have with this library-man by provoking an unexpected smile and a question mark by its curious presence on the counter by his desk. Small enough to be ignored, yet present in a way that may justify a pause in the formal exchange with the library-man, it invites special attention and in so doing the power of the paper-house becomes clear. Serious-not-serious, formal-informal at one and the same time, Gulka's decorative piece is a unique representation of the powerful meaning of the library in our academic life. Using symbols of sacrifice and belief, yet carrying the tenuous quality of being made from simple paper, the little house has created an interesting \"flirt\" between Judaism and Christianity, and between fellows and staff members. It highlights and bridges the threshold between hostility and hospitality (as Gulka himself has put it). While being exposed to multiple readings, as any other objected located in the public sphere, Gulka's piece also has marked the common denominator between all of us: books. Yes, just accepting the invitation, \"welcome,\" and taking an intimate look into the inside of the little house, you immediately see: books. The power of the library, after all, has been once again expressed.\n\n### Yalkut Reuveni and the Jewish literary genre of Collectanea\n\nGalit Hasan-Rokem\n\n~\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/hasan-rokem900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">~\n\nThe Rare Book Room at the Library of the Herbert D. Katz Center is home to a copy of the first printed edition of the Yalḳuṭ Reʾuveni: eleh divre Kabalah mi-divre sofrim / asher yagaʻ u-matsa (translation: the _Collectanea of Reuven:_ these are words of (mystical) tradition from writers' words/ that he toiled and found), issued in Prague in 1660 at the printing press of the sons of Ya'akov (Jacob) Ba\"k (The last name Ba\"k ב\"ק, an abbreviation, may refer to _Bene Kedoshim,_ literally \"sons of saints\", signifying that a forefather or -mother had suffered a violent death at the hands of non-Jews; it also may refer to an ancestor who was a _Ba'al Kore,_ a type of cantor). The editor is Reuven ben Hoske (d. 1673; in other sources Hoeshke and Hoeshke ben Hoeshke, a form of the name Yehoshua, Joshua) Katz. Notably, the copy held at the Library of the Katz Center is interspersed with a very erudite handwritten commentary by an East European Jew by the name of Horowitz.\n\nYalkut Re'uveni exists in two entirely different editions. The earlier, Prague 1660 printing, also known as the \"small\" Y\"R, is an alphabetical lexicon of various themes and items especially from Kabalistic and mystical books. The \"big\" Y\"R, Wilmersdorf edition of l681, follows the order of the Pentateuch like the older yalkuts and it includes much more materials than the earlier edition. According to the secondary literature as well as the various book inventories and lists that I have seen, this rare printed edition is the original form of the book. There are quite a few manuscripts of the book but they are all from the eighteenth and the nineteenth century, thus most probably copies based on the printed edition or copied from other hand written copies of the first printed edition. The paleographic details given in various catalogues point to a wide distribution and interest in the book in countries spanning from North West Germany to Yemen. Today there are copies in many libraries, among them in Hamburg, Goettingen, Strasbourg and Philadelphia!\n\nThe genre of the book is a _yalkut,_ derived from the Hebrew word to collect. According to Jacob Elbaum, one of the few scholars who have specialized in this genre, it emerged a couple of centuries after the end of the classical Rabbinic literary production of Midrash and Talmud literature. The Yalkut blossomed as a genre during two pre-modern periods: in the 13th-14th centuries CE, in works that have come to be known as the Yalkut Mekhiri and the Yalkut Shim'oni, elaborating on the books of the Bible; in the 16th-17th centuries CE, to which our specimen belongs. In the 16th century, two major collections of rabbinic literature were published by Jews in the Ottoman Empire; Ein Ya'akov and Hagadot ha-Talmud. The seventeenth century yalkut literature catered to the need to provide access to the then already voluminous libraries of Kabbalah and mysticism.\n\n### Franz Rosenzweig, Der Stern der Erlösung (1930 edition)\n\nMiriam Jerade\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jerade1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nFranz Rosenzweig (1886-1929) published his magnum opus The Star of Redemption (Der Stern der Erlösung) in 1921. Three years earlier, in August of 1918 while serving as a German soldier during World War I, Rosenzweig began writing down his thoughts on postcards which he mailed to his mother from the Balkan front where he was stationed. The Star of Redemptionwas driven by a critique of idealism, on the one hand, of Hegel's philosophy of history that in Rosenzweig's view lead to war as a collision of sovereign nation-states. On the other hand, in spite of its systematic construction, Rosenzweig critiques philosophical conceptions of rationality and rejects idealism's absolute knowledge in light of the cry of the mortal man that opens his book. Rosenzweig's philosophy is an engagement with individual radical singularity against a philosophy that would seek \"to reintegrate the action by the same necessity into the circle of the knowable All at the moment it elaborated it\" (SR, 16).\n\nThis complex system of philosophy and theology, composed during war time and embedded with notions of the Jewish liturgy and Christian theological concepts, was largely ignored when it first appeared. Gershom Scholem, the scholar of Jewish mysticism, called attention to the importance of the work when the second edition (shown here) appeared in 1930, a year after his death, but it was not until the end of the Second World War that its importance began to be appreciated. The book is divided into three parts and each part begins with an introduction. In general terms, the figure of the Star shows the relation between the Self, God and the World through the theological categories of Creation, Revelation and Redemption. For the second edition, Rosenzweig included the names of the chapter sections printed in the margin of the pages. The first printed note was \"About death\" and the last one \"The first.\"\n\n### What happens to a rationalist before he starts reasoning?\n\nMartin Kavka\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/kavka-cohen-liebermann900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/hermann.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/berlin.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe best known images of the neo-Kantian Jewish philosopher Hermann Cohen are from a series of etchings and drawings by the German-Jewish impressionist Max Liebermann. In most of them, he looks just like one expects a rationalist to look: eyes squinted so as better to look into his own mind, and more than a little snooty. (On the other hand, this drawing by Liebermann, might make some Americans think of fried chicken).\n\nBut in 1919, shortly after Cohen's death, his student Jacob Klatzkin wrote a small book in German about Cohen's thought that had, as its frontispiece, a reproduction of an etching by Hermann Struck (who taught Liebermann, as well as Marc Chagall). While the original German edition did not include the Lieberman engraving, Klatzkin's Hebrew edition, published in Berlin in 1923 did. Like Klatzkin's book, Struck's etching is a representation of a non-Zionist by a committed Zionist. It is a stronger intervention into Cohen's persona, and into his rationalism, than any of Liebermann's drawings. I remain struck by the detail around the eyes. What does Cohen see off in the distance? Why does he look so quizzical, or even apprehensive? What happens to a rationalist before he starts reasoning?\n\n### Theodor Reik, Probleme der Religionspsychologie, Teil 1. Ritual\n\nPaul Lerner\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/freud.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nTheodor Reik (1888-1969), today largely a forgotten figure, worked closely with Freud in early twentieth-century Vienna and made key contributions to the development of psychoanalysis in Europe and the US, helping establish the role of lay analysis and introducing literary and anthropological perspectives. After serving in World War I, Reik published the first part of his Probleme der Religionspsychologie \\[Problems in the Psychology of Religion\\] in 1919. With this text he pioneered the psychoanalytic study of religion, turning his Freudian lens onto such topics as the Kol Nidre prayer and the significance of the Shofar in Jewish ritual. Several years later Erich Fromm and Frieda Fromm-Reichmann followed up Reik's studies with their investigations of the psychoanalysis of Shabbat and kashrut (1927) and Freud himself—who wrote an introduction to Reik's 1919 work—completed his monumental study of Moses in 1938, just months before his death. Reik's investigations drew on his Jewish learning and his literary background—note the Moliere quote on the frontispiece—and his works stand out for their breadth and erudition.\n\n### Dialogues of Bereavement\n\nLital Levy\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/rach.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/ara.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nTwo powerful, wrenching documentary films, To Die in Jerusalem (dir. Hilla Medalia, 2007; produced for HBO) and One Day After Peace (dirs. Miri Laufer and Erez Laufer, 2012) feature bereaved Israeli mothers on a quest to find answers and ultimately, closure. To Die in Jerusalem follows Abigail Levy, the mother of Rachel Levy, 17, who was killed in a 2002 bombing in a Jerusalem suburb. Rachel's killer, Ayat al-Akhras, was an 18-year-old resident of the Deheisheh refugee camp in Jerusalem. Their proximity in age and close physical resemblance provoked an international media response picturing them as \"could-have-been\" friends or sisters. In the film, Levy pursues a meeting with Ayat al-Akhras's parents, seeking an explanation as well as a public repudiation of their daughter's act. Over a period of several years, the journey takes her to an Israeli prison for Arab women, to an aborted attempt to visit the al-Akhras family in Deheisheh, and finally to a meeting held remotely over satellite television. As viewers might predict, the long-sought encounter does not provide Levy with the answers she seeks. Rather, it graphically portrays the inevitable failure of a dialogue premised on a one-sided framework of expectations and mediation. Although Levy calls the shots through much of the film, when the conversation takes unexpected turns, she finds herself floundering. Ultimately she declares the dialogue a failure and walks off the set.\n\nBy contrast, One Day After Peace depicts the powerful and transformative possibilities of a genuinely open dialogue between perpetrators and victims, through conversations that do not seek a priori confirmation of the initiator's own beliefs. In this intensely moving film, Robi Damelin, who left her native South Africa during the apartheid era for Israel, grapples with a path forward following the death of her son David, who was shot and killed by a Palestinian sniper (Tha'ir Hammad) in the course of reserve military duty in the West Bank. Damelin becomes a leader in a joint Israeli-Palestinian organization of bereaved parents, attempts to initiate dialogue with Hammad, and returns to South Africa to conduct multiple interviews with both perpetrators and victims who took part in the Truth and Reconciliation Committee. The South African sections of the film show how the transformative power of confrontation, truth telling, and forgiveness can set a nation emerging from violent conflict on a different course. The question that lingers is whether such an approach will ever be possible or feasible for Palestinians and Israelis.\n\nImplicitly, both films dwell on questions of motherhood and bereavement as sites of connection that may transcend conflict and difference. In both films, mothers from all sides of both conflicts embrace this notion, but the various conversations in To Die in Jerusalem ultimately subordinate these \"universals\" to the harsh reality of political incommensurability, whereas One Day After Peace accepts incommensurability as a starting point and works forward to from there to seek out points of connection. Both films are also explorations of the roles of revenge and forgiveness in responding to the murder of loved ones. They ask us, the viewers, to reconsider our own assumptions concerning notions of victimhood, of terror, and of forgiveness. Through them we see the contingency of the roles of perpetrator and victim in competing historical narratives; we witness how questions of state violence, terror, and resistance are leveled and refuted by different parties in a conflict. These are not easy films to watch, but they are important glimpses into the experiences of human beings in long-term violent conflicts and into the efforts of ordinary people who have undergone the most unimaginable of losses to find socially meaningful responses to their pain.\n\n### Emunah u-vitahon\n\nShaul Magid\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cov.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nR. Avraham Karleitz, known as the Hazon Ish (1878-1953) was one of the most influential rabbinic figures in the twentieth century. Born in Kosava, then in Russia and studying in yeshivot in Vilna, Karleitz immigrated to Mandate Palestine in 1933, settling in the small hamlet of Bnei Brak near Tel Aviv. Over the next twenty years he helped build Bnei Brak into one of the _haredi_ centers of the world and remains the figurehead of the community more than half a century after his death.\n\nHazon Ish was known for his personal piety, his Talmudic acumen, and his legal responsum. He is less known for a small book entitled Emunah u-vitahon that he refused to publish during his life fearing it would be the cause of controversy in his community. The book is a subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle polemic against the Musar Movement that had gained traction in the _haredi_ world mid-century and also the Brisker method of Talmud study that focuses on novella (_hidush_) as opposed to the more straightforward understanding on the Talmudic text.\n\nIn Emunah u-vitahon, the Hazon Ish seeks to construct the halakhic subject—the one who falls in love with the law and submits him or herself to it as an act of piety and not mere obligation. The danger of musar and the mental gymnastics of the Brisker method for Hazon Ish is that these methods of human perfection require the autonomy of the self that is always subject to the deception of the _yetser ha-ra'_ (for Hazon Ish, the natural desire for self-interest). The only way to avoid this self-deception is through submission to a system, the law that could obligate one to act against one's self-interest. The law should not merely be followed but be loved such that the lover submits to it as an act of fidelity.\n\nThis critique of musar is also a critique of reason and the cultivation of love of the law achieved through consistent and intricate study of its details as an alternative to the natural inclination of love of the self. Hazon Ish saw that giving too much autonomy to the self that is endemic to musar's belief in the possibility of self-perfection through human agency would eventually endanger the sovereignty of the law in the lives of Jews.\n\nThis frontispiece is a copy of the first edition of Emunah u-vitahon published in 1954. It has been re-published many times and a full English translation appeared as Faith and Trust translated by Yaakov Goldstein in Israel in 2008.\n\n### Reading Faces\n\nAmos Morris-Reich\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/faces.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe nose is the organizing feature of the reproduced images that have been placed on this page, in a layout comprised of different kinds of media including portraits, photography, and text: the page features reproductions of ancient Egyptian portraits alongside an anthropological photograph of a Polish Jew in German-occupied Lodz, taken in late 1939 or early 1940. The images and their layout entwine science and scholarship with antisemitic and racist propaganda. Different kinds of media make different claims on reality and history.\n\nThis page is from a book on ancient _Judentum_ (a German term that includes Judaism, Jews, and Jewry) published jointly, in Nazi Germany in 1943, by a prominent geneticist, Eugen Fischer, and a prominent scholar of ancient Judaism, Gerhard Kittel. The book's untranslatable title, speaking of Ancient World Judentum (Das Antike Weltjudentum), suggests the immanent conspiratorial nature of the Jews; the book belongs to the same general context as the then-ongoing Nazi annihilation of European Jewry. Its purpose can be made legible by reconstructing the manipulations involved in the handling and interpretation of the images and Talmudic quotations. Studying it brings up larger, looming questions: how to read such texts? how to look at such images? Are they part of Jewish history? Can they be useful for Jewish studies, and if so for what purposes and under what assumptions or constraints?\n\n### Answering Yes and No\n\nPaul Nahme\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/pag.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nAs the dominant genre of rabbinic writing, a published volume of \"responsa\" or _teshuvot_ (lit. answers) was commonly expected of great rabbinic minds throughout the generations of Jewish diaspora life. However, the responsa written by Rabbi Yosef Dov Ber ha-Levi Soloveitchik, (1820-1892) were neither typical responses to legal and ritual (halakhic) inquiries, nor were they written in the style of previous rabbinic thinkers. The text, whose title page is depicted here, represents a grand departure in halakhic writing and inquiry.\n\nTaking the form of the halakhic responsum as a methodological means and rather than address practical halakhic queries, Soloveitchik developed insights into and innovative ways of understanding the corpus of Talmudic and medieval commentaries. His _teshuvot_ represent studies in the theoretical halakha, especially difficult and puzzling legal positions adopted by previous rabbis, and particularly pertaining to spheres of halakha that were of no immediate practical importance, such as Temple ritual and purity. Originally published in 1863, the Teshuvot Beit Ha-Levi marked the beginning of a new era in halakhic thinking and outlined a revolutionary model of theorizing the halakha, popularized by his son, Reb Ḥayyim of Brisk, and the descendants of the Soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty. Writing in a time of growing anxieties over whether halakhic minutiae had any relevance in a rapidly modernizing and rationalizing Jewish world, Soloveitchik's _teshuvot_ undertook a paradoxical response of yes and no to such a question: these _teshuvot_ introduced a radically different mode of reasoning, beyond the historicism or empirical rationalizing about law and custom (prominent of the Western _Wissenschaft des Judentums_); but they also sought to validate the study of halakha for its own sake (Torah li-shema) and embodied the ethos of the Yeshivah of Volozhin, where Soloveitchik served as dean between 1854-1865.\n\n### The Ordeal of Writing Hebrew\n\nShira Stav\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/stav.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nWhat we see here is a short letter from Uri Nissan Gnessin (1879-1913), the praised Hebrew author, great artist of prose, to his friend, the Hebrew poet and literary critic Ya'acov Fichman (1881-1958), who was then the editor of the Hebrew Journal Ha-Olam (The World). Gnessin grew up in the small town Pochep in Belorussia, but traveled a lot throughout his short life. He is responsible for some of the greatest works of modern Hebrew prose, such as Be-terem (The time before) and Etzel (Beside). Along with his close friend Yosef Haim Brenner (1881-1921), he was one of a small group of writers that invested all their material and poetic efforts in order to turn Hebrew into a modern and vivid literary language. Gnessin suffered from a severe heart disease that caused his death in 1913, in Warsaw. His death shocked and saddened the small community of Hebrew writers of the time, and his friends quickly published a memorial collection of his letters and some eulogies, Ha-Tsidah (Sideways), edited by Brenner and printed in Vilna, 1914.\n\nIn this letter to Fichman from February 1909, Gnessin, who stays in his parents'; house in Pochep, humorously tries to justify why he did not write earlier, and why he did not yet send any literary writings to be published: \"Honestly, my friend, Mother's bed is always soft to put me in a sweet sleep, and I am such a weak man, unfortunately, with such a strong drive ('yetser') . . . Fichman, Fichman! If you only knew how comfortable I am right now, and the fruit jams that awaits me there with the tea, which the children will surely lick away if I dawdle.\" These\"innocent,\" childlike excuses reveal some of the deepest issues of his literary work: the struggles of writing, the weakness of the will and the strength of the drive, the seduction of passivity and the lure of familial relations.\n\n### Desire\n\nZohar Weiman-Kelman\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/weiman-kelman-Moz1001900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/we.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nSpeaking from one woman to another, this poem sets up the desire for an encounter that the poet forecloses in advance. The first stanza speaks of an \"un-expected encounter\" that has not yet happened (\"ere still the light it did see\"). The second stanza invokes \"a certainty that dreams to be, \" yet declares it \"will not be able to be.\" These paradoxical statements thus narrate a promise and its negation. At the same time, this archival material, the poem's first appearance, reveals another story of poetic encounter and intertextual dialogue.\n\nThe poem was written by Hebrew poet Yocheved Bat Miriam (1901-1979) and was published on August 21st, 1930, in Moznaim, an Israeli literary journal active to this day. However, this poem is little known in its original form, for until recently it was only circulating in its 1963 version. This version was part of a collection edited by the poet, who took a vow of literary silence after her son Zuzik was killed in 1948. It was only in 2014 that a full version of her collected poetry was published, including a version of this poem almost identical to the original, save for one difference: the dedication to the Hebrew poet Rachel Bluvshteyn (1890-1931). The poem's version with the dedication comes from Bat-Miriam's first book, Merakhok, in 1932. Because this book was published shortly after Rachel's death in 1931 it has been taken to be a response to her death, explaining the impossibility of the address in the poem itself.\n\nAnd yet, the original version, found in the Katz library collection, reveals a poem published before Rachel's death and not yet dedicated to her. Instead, the poem declares a desire, which is then answered in Rachel's own poem, \"Ivria,\" published in the Hebrew paper Davar on November 14th 1930, and dedicated to Bat-Miriam. Bat-Miriam's dedication to Rachel is thus already an answer, coming after Rachel's poem, continuing a dialogue, much like the one the poem describes in the third stanza: \"you call, repeat, unseen/and answering you is me.\" But in this dialogue not just Rachel is implicated, but also the reader, for the Hebrew word for \"call\" is the same word as for \"read.\" Thus, instead of \"waiting in vain,\" the poem's call reaches us, and our reading, kri'a, is a call in return. Here the poem's \"you\" \\[_at_\\] and \"I,\" meet, against the odds, against history.\n\n### Torah-Yoga\n\nRachel Werczberger\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/tor.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nTorah Yoga, the attempt to synthesize Jewish texts and Hasidic knowledge with the Hindu-based Yoga practice, is one of the Jewish hybrid mind-body techniques that have recently emerged in in North America and Israel. Along with Jewish Healing, Hebrew Shamanism, the North American Jewish Renewal Movement and several communities in Israel, Torah Yoga may be perceived as a Jewish form of New Age spirituality, or simply as New Age Judaism (NAJ).\n\nThese different NAJ phenomena share, at least to some extent, a critique of institutionalized forms of mainstream Judaism—the Orthodox and Liberal denominations—and in turn attempt to renew Jewish life by means of ritual creativity and religious eclecticism. New Age Jews approach Judaism with playfulness and ease, fusing various traditional Jewish elements, and especially Kabbalah and Hasidism with New Age practices gleaned from Far Eastern religions, indigenous cultures and the Human Potential Movement. The end product may be described as a religious bricolage—a highly hybrid, individualized, experiential and emotional form of Judaism. As such, NAJ is emblematic of the subjective turn, individualization, and processes of emotionalization, that are now taking place in Jewish life.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Diamond, James.** \"Constructing a Jewish Philosophy of Being Toward Death,\" in _Jewish Philosophy for the Twenty-First Century: Personal Reflections,_ Edited by Aaron Hughes, Hava Tirosh-Samuelson (Leiden: Brill, 2014, 61-80).\n    \n*   . _Emil L.

Though rooted in neurological and physical responses, our scholars showed how emotions like love, anger, anxiety, joy, fear, empathy, sympathy, sadness, desire, pain, and pleasure are shaped by culture. Among the questions they posed are: how are we to explore and better understand emotions in Jewish cultural and political contexts? Are there distinctively Jewish aspects of universal human experiences of sensation - sight, sound, touch, or scent? What does Jewish thought have to say about the non-rational dimensions of Jewish philosophy and embodied spirituality beyond reason? Discussions of experiences of suffering, bereavement, distrust, art, architecture, photography, sexual desire, Jewish thought, ethics (musar), law (halakhah), psychoanalysis, trauma and culture, and New Age Judaism in the modern State of Israel, all form part of this year’s exhibition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"holy-fire\">Holy Fire\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>James A.

They are, without a doubt, a testament to the “life” lived beyond reason that the eminent philosopher Emil Fackenheim insisted Jewish thought after the Shoah must “go to school with.” The account of the ten rabbinic martyrs, including most famously Rabbi Akiva, tortured and killed by the Romans, must forever be recounted in the shadow of the Rebbe’s challenge to God just as the deportations from the Ghetto to the death camps begin:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“In truth it is incredible that the world continues to exist despite so many screams as these.

Now that innocent, angelic, pure children as well as great Jewish saints, who are even greater than angels, are being killed and slaughtered only because they are Jews, are filling the entire space of the world with these screams, and the world has not reverted to water, continues to exist as if nothing has affected it?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"neue-synagoge-berlin-1866\">Neue Synagoge Berlin (1866)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>John M.

It was also the most spectacular example of neo-Moorish synagogue architecture. The exterior was a mixture of Islamic and Romanesque elements that deployed yellow masonry through which ran horizontal stripes of red brick. The height of the façade was 92 feet while the depth of the synagogue was 308 feet. The central entrance was flanked by two giant towers, the one on the right housing the Jewish community administration, and a library with 67,000 volumes while he tower on the left served as a Jewish museum. On the exterior, the synagogue’s showpiece was the onion dome that soared majestically some 160 feet into the air. Wrapped in a blanket of zinc and swaddled in gold ribbing, crowned with a Star of David, the great dome was the brightest and most joyful architectural feature to be found anywhere in Berlin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With seating for 3,200 worshippers, the triple nave interior was a massive 188 feet long, 126 feet wide and soared to a height of 87 feet. The entire interior was a dazzling kaleidoscope of color, light, and texture. With Moorish decorative patterns from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the floors were inlaid with intricate mosaics, the walls were covered in richly colored stucco and then painted with stars and flora, while stalactite features hung from the ceiling and geometric and honeycomb patterns were widely deployed, including on the elaborate friezes that accented the temple’s interior. A technical breakthrough helped bathe the entire synagogue in a palette of many colors. The windows were double paned, with the outer windows made of clear glass and the inner windows of stained glass. An innovative system of gas lamps was installed in between the two panes throughout the synagogue, creating what one attendee at the synagogue’s dedication ceremony in 1866, said was a “magical effect.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Neue Synagoge was an immediate sensation. A contemporary newspaper account vividly described the synagogue as “a fairytale structure … . In the middle of a plain part of the city we are led into the fantastic wonder of the Alhambra, with graceful columns, sweeping arches, richly-colored Arabesques, abundant wood carvings, all with the thousandfold magic of the Moorish style.” On Friday, July 19, 1867, Lewis Carroll, author of Alice in Wonderland, visited the Neue Synagoge and recorded that “the building itself is most gorgeous, almost the whole interior surface being gilt or otherwise decorated.” Of the service itself, Carroll observed that “what was read was all in German, but there was a great deal chanted in Hebrew, to beautiful music: some of the chants have come down from very early times, perhaps as far back as David.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"no-deliverance-abel-pannthe-father-of-the-israeli-visual-akedah\">No Deliverance: Abel Pann—the father of the Israeli visual Akedah\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Yael S.

This lithograph clearly lacks the brightness and life that mark the rest of the images here. It also bears no resemblance to traditional Jewish representations. With its gloomy dark green and faded, almost lifeless beiges, it seems to be the first Jewish artistic attempt to focus exclusively on the human protagonists of the scene while omitting other actors – most significantly, the deliverance duo, the angel and the ram. As such, it had established the rule of “no deliverance” that has since governed the Israeli grappling with the topos as a symbol of Israel’s “national sacrifice”—its fallen soldiers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Confronted with Isaac’s bound and limp body, viewers of this painting are compelled to sense its physical pain, almost Caravaggio-style (The Sacrifice of Isaac, 1605). At the same time, the image gives the impression of a great intimacy between the binder and the bound, echoing perhaps Rembrandt’s famous etching (Abraham’s Sacrifice, 1655). Intriguingly, it is the father’s face rather than the son’s that expresses here the horror of the moment (see the “frozen” gaze in his eyes), underlined by the sharp knife still held in his hand. Indeed, Abel Pann fashioned the scene in the name of, or from the place of the fathers of the”Isaacs” of his time (the turbulent 1920s); hence the intense ambivalence and even guilt expressed in his [self?]-portrayal. Tragically, he seems to have anticipated his own fate. By the time he was to return to this topos in the late 1940s and 50s he would be a bereaved father, one of many, of the Israeli War of Independence. His own beloved first-born Eldad fell in Gush-Etsion on the eve of Independence (1928-May 14, 1948)—an experience that naturally exacerbated the feelings of pain and guilt that have since marked his (and others’) Akedah images by Israeli artists.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-house-that-joe-built\">The House that Joe Built\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Keren Friedmen-Peleg\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Friedman-Peleg900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>There are tense relations between the paper-house built by Josef Gulka, the circulation/stack manager at the Library at the Katz Center, and the objects around it. In an environment full of texts, at least some of them rare, most of them grappling with the very essence of Judaism between past and present, his small paper-house seems out of place. It has plastic lambs on top of it, a dinosaur in the front of it, and the caption “welcome” above it. The paper-house subtly interferes with the task-oriented interaction a patron might have with this library-man by provoking an unexpected smile and a question mark by its curious presence on the counter by his desk. Small enough to be ignored, yet present in a way that may justify a pause in the formal exchange with the library-man, it invites special attention and in so doing the power of the paper-house becomes clear. Serious-not-serious, formal-informal at one and the same time, Gulka’s decorative piece is a unique representation of the powerful meaning of the library in our academic life. Using symbols of sacrifice and belief, yet carrying the tenuous quality of being made from simple paper, the little house has created an interesting “flirt” between Judaism and Christianity, and between fellows and staff members. It highlights and bridges the threshold between hostility and hospitality (as Gulka himself has put it). While being exposed to multiple readings, as any other objected located in the public sphere, Gulka’s piece also has marked the common denominator between all of us: books. Yes, just accepting the invitation, “welcome,” and taking an intimate look into the inside of the little house, you immediately see: books. The power of the library, after all, has been once again expressed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"yalkut-reuveni-and-the-jewish-literary-genre-of-collectanea\">Yalkut Reuveni and the Jewish literary genre of Collectanea\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Galit Hasan-Rokem\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cdel>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/hasan-rokem900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/del>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Rare Book Room at the Library of the Herbert D.

The editor is Reuven ben Hoske (d. 1673; in other sources Hoeshke and Hoeshke ben Hoeshke, a form of the name Yehoshua, Joshua) Katz. Notably, the copy held at the Library of the Katz Center is interspersed with a very erudite handwritten commentary by an East European Jew by the name of Horowitz.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yalkut Re’uveni exists in two entirely different editions. The earlier, Prague 1660 printing, also known as the “small” Y”R, is an alphabetical lexicon of various themes and items especially from Kabalistic and mystical books. The “big” Y”R, Wilmersdorf edition of l681, follows the order of the Pentateuch like the older yalkuts and it includes much more materials than the earlier edition. According to the secondary literature as well as the various book inventories and lists that I have seen, this rare printed edition is the original form of the book. There are quite a few manuscripts of the book but they are all from the eighteenth and the nineteenth century, thus most probably copies based on the printed edition or copied from other hand written copies of the first printed edition. The paleographic details given in various catalogues point to a wide distribution and interest in the book in countries spanning from North West Germany to Yemen. Today there are copies in many libraries, among them in Hamburg, Goettingen, Strasbourg and Philadelphia!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The genre of the book is a \u003Cem>yalkut,\u003C/em> derived from the Hebrew word to collect. According to Jacob Elbaum, one of the few scholars who have specialized in this genre, it emerged a couple of centuries after the end of the classical Rabbinic literary production of Midrash and Talmud literature. The Yalkut blossomed as a genre during two pre-modern periods: in the 13th-14th centuries CE, in works that have come to be known as the Yalkut Mekhiri and the Yalkut Shim’oni, elaborating on the books of the Bible; in the 16th-17th centuries CE, to which our specimen belongs. In the 16th century, two major collections of rabbinic literature were published by Jews in the Ottoman Empire; Ein Ya’akov and Hagadot ha-Talmud. The seventeenth century yalkut literature catered to the need to provide access to the then already voluminous libraries of Kabbalah and mysticism.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"franz-rosenzweig-der-stern-der-erlösung-1930-edition\">Franz Rosenzweig, Der Stern der Erlösung (1930 edition)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Miriam Jerade\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jerade1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Franz Rosenzweig (1886-1929) published his magnum opus The Star of Redemption (Der Stern der Erlösung) in 1921. Three years earlier, in August of 1918 while serving as a German soldier during World War I, Rosenzweig began writing down his thoughts on postcards which he mailed to his mother from the Balkan front where he was stationed. The Star of Redemptionwas driven by a critique of idealism, on the one hand, of Hegel’s philosophy of history that in Rosenzweig’s view lead to war as a collision of sovereign nation-states. On the other hand, in spite of its systematic construction, Rosenzweig critiques philosophical conceptions of rationality and rejects idealism’s absolute knowledge in light of the cry of the mortal man that opens his book. Rosenzweig’s philosophy is an engagement with individual radical singularity against a philosophy that would seek “to reintegrate the action by the same necessity into the circle of the knowable All at the moment it elaborated it” (SR, 16).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This complex system of philosophy and theology, composed during war time and embedded with notions of the Jewish liturgy and Christian theological concepts, was largely ignored when it first appeared. Gershom Scholem, the scholar of Jewish mysticism, called attention to the importance of the work when the second edition (shown here) appeared in 1930, a year after his death, but it was not until the end of the Second World War that its importance began to be appreciated. The book is divided into three parts and each part begins with an introduction. In general terms, the figure of the Star shows the relation between the Self, God and the World through the theological categories of Creation, Revelation and Redemption. For the second edition, Rosenzweig included the names of the chapter sections printed in the margin of the pages. The first printed note was “About death” and the last one “The first.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"what-happens-to-a-rationalist-before-he-starts-reasoning\">What happens to a rationalist before he starts reasoning?\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Martin Kavka\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/kavka-cohen-liebermann900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/hermann.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/berlin.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The best known images of the neo-Kantian Jewish philosopher Hermann Cohen are from a series of etchings and drawings by the German-Jewish impressionist Max Liebermann. In most of them, he looks just like one expects a rationalist to look: eyes squinted so as better to look into his own mind, and more than a little snooty. (On the other hand, this drawing by Liebermann, might make some Americans think of fried chicken).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But in 1919, shortly after Cohen’s death, his student Jacob Klatzkin wrote a small book in German about Cohen’s thought that had, as its frontispiece, a reproduction of an etching by Hermann Struck (who taught Liebermann, as well as Marc Chagall). While the original German edition did not include the Lieberman engraving, Klatzkin’s Hebrew edition, published in Berlin in 1923 did. Like Klatzkin’s book, Struck’s etching is a representation of a non-Zionist by a committed Zionist. It is a stronger intervention into Cohen’s persona, and into his rationalism, than any of Liebermann’s drawings. I remain struck by the detail around the eyes. What does Cohen see off in the distance? Why does he look so quizzical, or even apprehensive? What happens to a rationalist before he starts reasoning?\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"theodor-reik-probleme-der-religionspsychologie-teil-1-ritual\">Theodor Reik, Probleme der Religionspsychologie, Teil 1.

After serving in World War I, Reik published the first part of his Probleme der Religionspsychologie [Problems in the Psychology of Religion] in 1919. With this text he pioneered the psychoanalytic study of religion, turning his Freudian lens onto such topics as the Kol Nidre prayer and the significance of the Shofar in Jewish ritual. Several years later Erich Fromm and Frieda Fromm-Reichmann followed up Reik’s studies with their investigations of the psychoanalysis of Shabbat and kashrut (1927) and Freud himself—who wrote an introduction to Reik’s 1919 work—completed his monumental study of Moses in 1938, just months before his death. Reik’s investigations drew on his Jewish learning and his literary background—note the Moliere quote on the frontispiece—and his works stand out for their breadth and erudition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"dialogues-of-bereavement\">Dialogues of Bereavement\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Lital Levy\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/rach.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/ara.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Two powerful, wrenching documentary films, To Die in Jerusalem (dir. Hilla Medalia, 2007; produced for HBO) and One Day After Peace (dirs. Miri Laufer and Erez Laufer, 2012) feature bereaved Israeli mothers on a quest to find answers and ultimately, closure. To Die in Jerusalem follows Abigail Levy, the mother of Rachel Levy, 17, who was killed in a 2002 bombing in a Jerusalem suburb. Rachel’s killer, Ayat al-Akhras, was an 18-year-old resident of the Deheisheh refugee camp in Jerusalem. Their proximity in age and close physical resemblance provoked an international media response picturing them as “could-have-been” friends or sisters. In the film, Levy pursues a meeting with Ayat al-Akhras’s parents, seeking an explanation as well as a public repudiation of their daughter’s act. Over a period of several years, the journey takes her to an Israeli prison for Arab women, to an aborted attempt to visit the al-Akhras family in Deheisheh, and finally to a meeting held remotely over satellite television. As viewers might predict, the long-sought encounter does not provide Levy with the answers she seeks. Rather, it graphically portrays the inevitable failure of a dialogue premised on a one-sided framework of expectations and mediation. Although Levy calls the shots through much of the film, when the conversation takes unexpected turns, she finds herself floundering. Ultimately she declares the dialogue a failure and walks off the set.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By contrast, One Day After Peace depicts the powerful and transformative possibilities of a genuinely open dialogue between perpetrators and victims, through conversations that do not seek a priori confirmation of the initiator’s own beliefs. In this intensely moving film, Robi Damelin, who left her native South Africa during the apartheid era for Israel, grapples with a path forward following the death of her son David, who was shot and killed by a Palestinian sniper (Tha’ir Hammad) in the course of reserve military duty in the West Bank. Damelin becomes a leader in a joint Israeli-Palestinian organization of bereaved parents, attempts to initiate dialogue with Hammad, and returns to South Africa to conduct multiple interviews with both perpetrators and victims who took part in the Truth and Reconciliation Committee. The South African sections of the film show how the transformative power of confrontation, truth telling, and forgiveness can set a nation emerging from violent conflict on a different course. The question that lingers is whether such an approach will ever be possible or feasible for Palestinians and Israelis.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Implicitly, both films dwell on questions of motherhood and bereavement as sites of connection that may transcend conflict and difference. In both films, mothers from all sides of both conflicts embrace this notion, but the various conversations in To Die in Jerusalem ultimately subordinate these “universals” to the harsh reality of political incommensurability, whereas One Day After Peace accepts incommensurability as a starting point and works forward to from there to seek out points of connection. Both films are also explorations of the roles of revenge and forgiveness in responding to the murder of loved ones. They ask us, the viewers, to reconsider our own assumptions concerning notions of victimhood, of terror, and of forgiveness. Through them we see the contingency of the roles of perpetrator and victim in competing historical narratives; we witness how questions of state violence, terror, and resistance are leveled and refuted by different parties in a conflict. These are not easy films to watch, but they are important glimpses into the experiences of human beings in long-term violent conflicts and into the efforts of ordinary people who have undergone the most unimaginable of losses to find socially meaningful responses to their pain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"emunah-u-vitahon\">Emunah u-vitahon\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Shaul Magid\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cov.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>R. Avraham Karleitz, known as the Hazon Ish (1878-1953) was one of the most influential rabbinic figures in the twentieth century. Born in Kosava, then in Russia and studying in yeshivot in Vilna, Karleitz immigrated to Mandate Palestine in 1933, settling in the small hamlet of Bnei Brak near Tel Aviv. Over the next twenty years he helped build Bnei Brak into one of the \u003Cem>haredi\u003C/em> centers of the world and remains the figurehead of the community more than half a century after his death.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hazon Ish was known for his personal piety, his Talmudic acumen, and his legal responsum. He is less known for a small book entitled Emunah u-vitahon that he refused to publish during his life fearing it would be the cause of controversy in his community. The book is a subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle polemic against the Musar Movement that had gained traction in the \u003Cem>haredi\u003C/em> world mid-century and also the Brisker method of Talmud study that focuses on novella (\u003Cem>hidush\u003C/em>) as opposed to the more straightforward understanding on the Talmudic text.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In Emunah u-vitahon, the Hazon Ish seeks to construct the halakhic subject—the one who falls in love with the law and submits him or herself to it as an act of piety and not mere obligation. The danger of musar and the mental gymnastics of the Brisker method for Hazon Ish is that these methods of human perfection require the autonomy of the self that is always subject to the deception of the \u003Cem>yetser ha-ra’\u003C/em> (for Hazon Ish, the natural desire for self-interest). The only way to avoid this self-deception is through submission to a system, the law that could obligate one to act against one’s self-interest. The law should not merely be followed but be loved such that the lover submits to it as an act of fidelity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This critique of musar is also a critique of reason and the cultivation of love of the law achieved through consistent and intricate study of its details as an alternative to the natural inclination of love of the self. Hazon Ish saw that giving too much autonomy to the self that is endemic to musar’s belief in the possibility of self-perfection through human agency would eventually endanger the sovereignty of the law in the lives of Jews.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This frontispiece is a copy of the first edition of Emunah u-vitahon published in 1954.

The images and their layout entwine science and scholarship with antisemitic and racist propaganda. Different kinds of media make different claims on reality and history.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This page is from a book on ancient \u003Cem>Judentum\u003C/em> (a German term that includes Judaism, Jews, and Jewry) published jointly, in Nazi Germany in 1943, by a prominent geneticist, Eugen Fischer, and a prominent scholar of ancient Judaism, Gerhard Kittel. The book’s untranslatable title, speaking of Ancient World Judentum (Das Antike Weltjudentum), suggests the immanent conspiratorial nature of the Jews; the book belongs to the same general context as the then-ongoing Nazi annihilation of European Jewry. Its purpose can be made legible by reconstructing the manipulations involved in the handling and interpretation of the images and Talmudic quotations. Studying it brings up larger, looming questions: how to read such texts? how to look at such images? Are they part of Jewish history?

However, the responsa written by Rabbi Yosef Dov Ber ha-Levi Soloveitchik, (1820-1892) were neither typical responses to legal and ritual (halakhic) inquiries, nor were they written in the style of previous rabbinic thinkers. The text, whose title page is depicted here, represents a grand departure in halakhic writing and inquiry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Taking the form of the halakhic responsum as a methodological means and rather than address practical halakhic queries, Soloveitchik developed insights into and innovative ways of understanding the corpus of Talmudic and medieval commentaries. His \u003Cem>teshuvot\u003C/em> represent studies in the theoretical halakha, especially difficult and puzzling legal positions adopted by previous rabbis, and particularly pertaining to spheres of halakha that were of no immediate practical importance, such as Temple ritual and purity. Originally published in 1863, the Teshuvot Beit Ha-Levi marked the beginning of a new era in halakhic thinking and outlined a revolutionary model of theorizing the halakha, popularized by his son, Reb Ḥayyim of Brisk, and the descendants of the Soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty. Writing in a time of growing anxieties over whether halakhic minutiae had any relevance in a rapidly modernizing and rationalizing Jewish world, Soloveitchik’s \u003Cem>teshuvot\u003C/em> undertook a paradoxical response of yes and no to such a question: these \u003Cem>teshuvot\u003C/em> introduced a radically different mode of reasoning, beyond the historicism or empirical rationalizing about law and custom (prominent of the Western \u003Cem>Wissenschaft des Judentums\u003C/em>); but they also sought to validate the study of halakha for its own sake (Torah li-shema) and embodied the ethos of the Yeshivah of Volozhin, where Soloveitchik served as dean between 1854-1865.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-ordeal-of-writing-hebrew\">The Ordeal of Writing Hebrew\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Shira Stav\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/stav.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>What we see here is a short letter from Uri Nissan Gnessin (1879-1913), the praised Hebrew author, great artist of prose, to his friend, the Hebrew poet and literary critic Ya’acov Fichman (1881-1958), who was then the editor of the Hebrew Journal Ha-Olam (The World). Gnessin grew up in the small town Pochep in Belorussia, but traveled a lot throughout his short life. He is responsible for some of the greatest works of modern Hebrew prose, such as Be-terem (The time before) and Etzel (Beside). Along with his close friend Yosef Haim Brenner (1881-1921), he was one of a small group of writers that invested all their material and poetic efforts in order to turn Hebrew into a modern and vivid literary language. Gnessin suffered from a severe heart disease that caused his death in 1913, in Warsaw. His death shocked and saddened the small community of Hebrew writers of the time, and his friends quickly published a memorial collection of his letters and some eulogies, Ha-Tsidah (Sideways), edited by Brenner and printed in Vilna, 1914.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this letter to Fichman from February 1909, Gnessin, who stays in his parents’; house in Pochep, humorously tries to justify why he did not write earlier, and why he did not yet send any literary writings to be published: “Honestly, my friend, Mother’s bed is always soft to put me in a sweet sleep, and I am such a weak man, unfortunately, with such a strong drive (‘yetser’) … Fichman, Fichman! If you only knew how comfortable I am right now, and the fruit jams that awaits me there with the tea, which the children will surely lick away if I dawdle.” These”innocent,” childlike excuses reveal some of the deepest issues of his literary work: the struggles of writing, the weakness of the will and the strength of the drive, the seduction of passivity and the lure of familial relations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"desire\">Desire\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Zohar Weiman-Kelman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/weiman-kelman-Moz1001900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/we.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Speaking from one woman to another, this poem sets up the desire for an encounter that the poet forecloses in advance. The first stanza speaks of an “un-expected encounter” that has not yet happened (“ere still the light it did see”). The second stanza invokes “a certainty that dreams to be, ” yet declares it “will not be able to be.” These paradoxical statements thus narrate a promise and its negation. At the same time, this archival material, the poem’s first appearance, reveals another story of poetic encounter and intertextual dialogue.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The poem was written by Hebrew poet Yocheved Bat Miriam (1901-1979) and was published on August 21st, 1930, in Moznaim, an Israeli literary journal active to this day. However, this poem is little known in its original form, for until recently it was only circulating in its 1963 version. This version was part of a collection edited by the poet, who took a vow of literary silence after her son Zuzik was killed in 1948. It was only in 2014 that a full version of her collected poetry was published, including a version of this poem almost identical to the original, save for one difference: the dedication to the Hebrew poet Rachel Bluvshteyn (1890-1931). The poem’s version with the dedication comes from Bat-Miriam’s first book, Merakhok, in 1932. Because this book was published shortly after Rachel’s death in 1931 it has been taken to be a response to her death, explaining the impossibility of the address in the poem itself.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And yet, the original version, found in the Katz library collection, reveals a poem published before Rachel’s death and not yet dedicated to her. Instead, the poem declares a desire, which is then answered in Rachel’s own poem, “Ivria,” published in the Hebrew paper Davar on November 14th 1930, and dedicated to Bat-Miriam. Bat-Miriam’s dedication to Rachel is thus already an answer, coming after Rachel’s poem, continuing a dialogue, much like the one the poem describes in the third stanza: “you call, repeat, unseen/and answering you is me.” But in this dialogue not just Rachel is implicated, but also the reader, for the Hebrew word for “call” is the same word as for “read.” Thus, instead of “waiting in vain,” the poem’s call reaches us, and our reading, kri’a, is a call in return. Here the poem’s “you” [\u003Cem>at\u003C/em>] and “I,” meet, against the odds, against history.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"torah-yoga\">Torah-Yoga\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Rachel Werczberger\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105047im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/tor.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Torah Yoga, the attempt to synthesize Jewish texts and Hasidic knowledge with the Hindu-based Yoga practice, is one of the Jewish hybrid mind-body techniques that have recently emerged in in North America and Israel. Along with Jewish Healing, Hebrew Shamanism, the North American Jewish Renewal Movement and several communities in Israel, Torah Yoga may be perceived as a Jewish form of New Age spirituality, or simply as New Age Judaism (NAJ).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These different NAJ phenomena share, at least to some extent, a critique of institutionalized forms of mainstream Judaism—the Orthodox and Liberal denominations—and in turn attempt to renew Jewish life by means of ritual creativity and religious eclecticism. New Age Jews approach Judaism with playfulness and ease, fusing various traditional Jewish elements, and especially Kabbalah and Hasidism with New Age practices gleaned from Far Eastern religions, indigenous cultures and the Human Potential Movement. The end product may be described as a religious bricolage—a highly hybrid, individualized, experiential and emotional form of Judaism. As such, NAJ is emblematic of the subjective turn, individualization, and processes of emotionalization, that are now taking place in Jewish life.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Diamond, James.\u003C/strong> “Constructing a Jewish Philosophy of Being Toward Death,” in \u003Cem>Jewish Philosophy for the Twenty-First Century: Personal Reflections,\u003C/em> Edited by Aaron Hughes, Hava Tirosh-Samuelson (Leiden: Brill, 2014, 61-80).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>. \u003Cem>Emil L.

In so doing, the Fellows broke new ground by looking beyond the more familiar paradigms of modern and contemporary Jewish history in European, American, and Israeli contexts.   \n\nThe goals for the year were to bridge linguistic, geographic, social, and methodological boundaries, to connect the study of the intellectual with the study of the everyday, and to encourage attention to new sources and approaches.  In this year’s web exhibition, we feature a selection of contributions from the Fellowship program’s international cohort who brought a range of disciplinary backgrounds and regional expertise to the topic. Each explores complex relationships between Jews and their Muslim neighbors, or with members of other non-Muslim or minority communities in the Islamic world. Research projects include ones focused on journalism and film, literature, gender relations, economic behavior, cultural expression, and religious life as these developed across diverse Islamic contexts.\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### Photographing contemporary Turkish Jewry\n\nEsra Almas\n\nLaurence Salzmann’s photographs do not simply record the Jewish past. They capture Jewish lives, communities and their everyday rituals, which are infinitely difficult to document. His photographs are not about the spectacular aspects of the metropolis. Nor are they about monuments; they are about the moment, about movement - about life.\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/cemetery-1.jpg)\n\nCemetery: The present, with the past, runs much deeper, Salzmann’s photographs of Jewish relics seem to say. This closeup of a Jewish tombstone in Ortakoy cemetery where Hebrew letters meet Ottoman ornamentation, with the Bosporus bridge, as the background, is an elegant attestation. One can hear the roar of traffic: hordes of cars crisscrossing Europe and Asia.\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/salzman-brothers2.jpg)\n\nMOURNING: _La Meza de Guevo_. In _La Meza de Guevo_, Salzmann takes us to the mourning ceremony for the mother of the acclaimed photographer Izet Keribar. We see two brothers sitting by the table in mourning costumes. We hear the kaddish. We smell the anise that oozes from Raki. We share the pain.\n\nSalzmann, a native Philadelphian, donated his life's work to the Penn Libraries in 2018.  The Laurence and Ayşe Gürsan Salzmann Collection, from which these two images are drawn, consists of over twenty discrete projects which span over fifty years and four continents, is distinguished by his exquisite aesthetic and unique anthropological field-work.  These two photographs belong to a body of material he published as _Anyos Munchos i Buenos_, co-authored with Ayşe Gürsan-Salzmann (Blue Flower/Photo Review,1990).\n\n### Gene Schramm, Judeo-Baghdadi: A Descriptive Analysis of the Colloquial Arabic of the Jews of Baghdad\n\nNancy E. Berg\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/Berg_%20JudaeoBaghdadi001.jpg)\n\nThe only copies—one typescript, one microfilm—of this work are both here in the library at the Katz Center. The study is the first of its kind, predating Haim Blanc’s _Communal Dialects in Baghdad_ (1964), and _Ha-Aravit Ha-Yehudit shel Baghdad_ by Yaakov Mansour (1975-1983; a condensed version was published in English translation in 1991 as The Jewish Baghdadi Dialect). The latest - and quite possibly last  - in this list is Assaf Bar-Moshe's _The Arabic Dialect of the Jews of Baghdad :Phonology, Morphology, and Texts_ (2019).\n\nWhile this year marked the first time the Katz Center took up the study of Sephardi and Mizrachi Jewry, Schramm’s dissertation written under the aegis of Dropsie College, the Katz Center’s first incarnation, suggests a wonderful continuity. So too the very subject touches on the core of some of the liveliest discussions this year, about the nature and distinctiveness of the language. Is Judeo-Arabic a distinct language, thus reflecting the degree to which Jews of Arab lands held themselves apart from their neighbors, or is it a dialect, separated mostly by pronunciation and selected vocabulary?\n\nSchramm’s dissertation is classically philological, covering the phonemics, morphology, and syntax of the vernacular spoken by Baghdadi Jews. His data comes from fieldwork: three months spent in Israel in 1952 interviewing immigrants from Iraq. The study itself would likely appeal only to linguists until the last chapter in which two short texts are recorded, transliterated, notated, and rendered into English. The stories they tell—one about an exhumed rabbi and the other, a purloined parrot—bring life to the language, revealing as much about relations between Baghdadi Jews and their Muslim neighbors as they do about its linguistic attributes.\n\n### Bulgarian Ketubah, Ruse 1831\n\nDina Danon\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/danon.png)\n\nThis _ketubah_, or marriage contract, comes from Rusçuk, a port city on the Danube in the Ottoman Balkans. Dating from 1831, the _ketubah_ was drawn up only a few decades after the Sephardi community of Rusçuk, now Ruse in Bulgaria, was established. The _ketubah_ records the marriage of Aron, son of Moshe Merkado, and Bilia (Behorah), daughter of Haim Daniel de Leon Parisiado. The two arches, which bear both Islamic and Italianate motifs, contain standard _ketubah_ language as well as the specifics of the bride’s dowry. At the bottom left we find an itemized trousseau in Judeo-Spanish detailing the numerous garments, textiles, and household items Bilia was to bring to her new home.\n\nAs one of only two known _ketubbot_ from Rusçuk, the source sheds light on the growth of the Sephardi community in the city and its position at a crossroads between East and West.  No less significant are the implications the document has for our understanding of marriage in the eastern Sephardi diaspora and the expectations and transactions that undergirded it before the profound political, cultural, and social transformations of the late nineteenth century.      \n\n### Eliyahu Bekhor Hazan’s Zikhron Yerushalayim\n\nKeren Dotan\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/dotancover.jpg)\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/dotan-title-a.jpg)\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/dotan-opening-a.jpg)\n\n_Zikhron Yerushalayim_ is a play written by rabbi Eliyahu Bekhor Hazan in 1874. Hazan, who was born in Izmir in 1845, was raised and educated in Eretz-Yisrael/Ottoman Palestine, and in the 1870s was sent as a _ShaDaR_ to Algeria, Tunisia, and Tripoli. When he was offered a position in Tripoli, he asked to travel briefly to Jerusalem to make some final arrangements. On his way, he stopped in Livorno, Italy, and printed his first book at the printing house of the famous _mekubal_ Eliyahu Benamozegh. This was his only known work of prose (although he did publish short reports in Hebrew newspapers). Later, in 1888, he became the rabbi of Alexandria, where he served until his death, and published a long line of halakhic texts, the most famous of which is _Ta'alumot Lev_.\n\nStructured as a symposium, _Zikhron Yerushalayim_ brings a polyphony of perspectives and opinions among the Jews in Tunis, out of which stems the need for a “pan-Jewish” convention, as eventually takes place in the second part of the text. This imaginary convention gathers representatives from all Jewish factions and diasporas (an Ashkenazi, an Italian, a “Talmudic”, etc.) in an attempt to settle timely halakhic, philosophical, and cultural concerns of the Jewish people. The opening page (in the third photo) reveals the author’s implicit prophetic position as a resident of the Holy land, who also traveled through the enlightened countries, and can thus acknowledge the crisis of the Jewish people, formulated in the biblical words: “The earth is violently broken, the earth is split open, the earth is shaken exceedingly” (Isaiah 24:19).\n\n### Sefer Zivhe Tsedek of R. 'Abdullah Somekh and the Baghdadi Jewish printing house of R. Shlomo Bekhor Hutsin\n\nAnnie Greene\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/greene.jpg)\n\nSefer Zivhe Tsedek, authored by Rabbi 'Abdullah Somekh, contains halakhic rulings, commentaries on Shulhan ‘arukh  Yoreh De'ah, and halakhic responsa to queries from Jewish communities in Ottoman Iraq, Qajar Persia, and the Baghdadi diaspora communities in India and China. Rabbi 'Abdullah Somekh (1813-1889) was an Ottoman Baghdadi rabbi, rosh yeshiva (head of the Jewish religious academy), and halakhic scholar whose death and burial caused a municipal scandal in Baghdad. This particular edition of Sefer Zivhe Tsedek was printed posthumously in the Baghdadi printing house of Rabbi Shlomo Bekhor Hutsin in 1898 or 1899. Rabbi Hutsin (1843-1893) opened the third Hebrew language printing house in Baghdad in 1867 and printed books of Torah, science, and history in Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic in his press. His son Yehoshua continued printing books at this press, like Rabbi 'Abdullah Somekh's Zivhe Tsedek.\n\n### Judeo-Turkish Liturgical Poetry\n\nHadar Feldman Samet\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901110140im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Feldman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nCAJS Rare Ms. 434, purchased at Kestenbaum and Company Auction, was originally from the library of Hebrew College, near Boston.\n\nThe manuscript is provisionally called a “Collection of Judeo-Turkish Piyyutim”, a title which only partly reveals the content of this manuscript. Among the 112 pages, about half consist of Turkish language poems written down in Hebrew script by two different scribes and not sequentially bound; the rest of the material, as documented in the catalog, includes Hebrew and Arabic texts in Hebrew scripts from 19th-20th centuries Morocco and Yemen. Each of the seven sections of this unique manuscript, and the fact that they are all bound together, offer  interesting sources for investigating popular religious practices as well as the study of the materiality of manuscripts of Jews in modern Islamic contexts. Focusing on the dominant part of the manuscript composed in Judeo-Turkish also provides a rare opportunity to rethink the relationship between Turkish language and Jewish culture in the Ottoman empire.\n\n### South Asian Hebrew-Marathi liturgies\n\nSifra Lentin\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/lentin-rajpurkar.jpg)\n\n**fig. 1:**\n\nJoseph Ezekial Rajpurkar (1834-1905) translated this volume of daily (Siddur) prayers from its original Hebrew into Marathi, the language of his community -- the Bene Israel of India. This Jewish community is believed to be one of the ten Lost Tribes of the Kingdom of Israel. They arrived on the west coast of the Indian subcontinent sometime before the fall of the Second Temple in 70 C.E. Rajpurkar was motivated in his academic pursuits by a unique confluence of Bene Israel, Baghdadi Jewish and Christian influences.\n\nHe belonged to the few Bene Israel families devoted to the field of education at a time when many families looked to military service as a career. His father was superintendent of schools for the Free Church Mission (Anglican) in Bombay and Kolaba District (in the mainland just south of Bombay), that worked actively among the Bene Israel. Rajpurkar’s own school and college education proceeded under the tutelage of outstanding Anglican missionaries, which included the Rev. John Wilson, known for the keen interest he took in the education of the Bene Israel. Rev. Wilson wrote the foundational 'Rudiments of Hebrew Grammar in Marathi' (Bombay, 1831) to enable the Bene Israel to read the Old Testament.\n\nAs a product of an Anglican missionary education, a good working knowledge of Hebrew, and interactions with the orthodox Bombay Baghdadi Jews as headmaster of the David Sassoon Benevolent Institution for 40 years, Rajpurkar realized the discrepancies between the Christian interpretation and the Jewish one of certain passages of the Old Testament. He was determined to master Hebrew in order to study the original Hebrew liturgy himself.\n\nThis Siddur is one of twenty books (not all translations) that he published during his lifetime. Rajpurkar was also appointed in 1871 as Examiner of Hebrew at the University of Bombay.\n\nThis Siddur is a second edition. The first edition was published in 1889 during Rajpurkar's lifetime.\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/lentin-penkar.jpg)\n\n**fig. 2:**\n\nThis Marathi translation of the Pesah service for the first two nights of Passover, by Hyams Ezekiel Penkar, follows a rich mid-19th century tradition among the Bene Israel community of India of publishing translations of Hebrew liturgy in the spoken and written language of the community. The Bene Israel from the western Indian state of Maharashtra are considered, along with the Malabar Jews from the south-western Indian state of Kerala, as the oldest Jewish communities on the subcontinent.\n\nThe first Hebrew-Marathi Haggadah was published in Bombay as early as 1846 by a combined effort of a Cochin Jew, two Bene Israel and a Baghdadi Jew. Most Bene Israel translators were recipients of Anglican missionary school education, which gave them a foundation in Hebrew.\n\n### Eliezar Farhi and the Tunisian Jewish Publishing Renaissance\n\nSarah Frances Levin\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/levin-title.jpg)\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/levin-preface.jpg)\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/levin-in.jpg)\n\nPictured here are the title page, preface, and an interior page of Sefer Bereshit \\\\\\[The Book of Genesis\\\\\\], published by Al-Nasr Press \\\\\\[Eagle Press\\\\\\], Tunis, 1906, and “Arabicized from the Hebrew language into the language of the Barbary.” “Language of the Barbary” (_“Lughat al-Barbari”_) is one of the colloquial terms Tunisian Jewish speakers of Arabic used to distinguish their vernacular from those of other North African and Middle Eastern countries, as well as from Standard Arabic.\n\nThe translator and founder/owner of the press, Rabbi Eliezar (Lazarro) Farhi (1851-1930), was one of the foremost pioneers of a Tunisian Jewish publishing renaissance that started at the end of the 19th century. A strong believer in the didactic potential of publishing, Farhi explains in his preface (pictured), “We decided to translate \\\\\\[the Torah and the Prophets\\\\\\] into the Barbary language so that any reader can understand them. We have … given \\\\\\[the book of Genesis\\\\\\] a low price, so that it might be available to all.” This was, however, to be the only book of Torah translation he published, making it somewhat of an exception, given that the bulk of Farhi’s prolific publishing projects were translations from Arabic popular and folk literature, such as the _siyar sha‘biyya_ (lit. “folk biographies,” a corpus of Arabic folk epics), which he also considered to serve didactic purposes. Other publishing projects included journals he founded and stories he wrote in the form of parables. By publishing in vernacular Arabic written in Hebrew characters (as most readers did not have facility in either Arabic or Latin scripts) rather than in Hebrew or Standard Arabic (the languages of the lettered elite), Farhi led the trend to democratize the Jewish reading public. Furthermore, by publishing such works, particularly during the early decades of French colonization, Farhi showed that one could be modern—that is, participate fully in the institutions and norms of one’s time—without following a European definition or model of modernity.\n\nAcknowledgment to Noam Sienna and Rachel Schine for their insights that contributed to this caption.\n\n### Fraught Histories: Revue de l'histoire juive en Égypte\n\nYoram Meital\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/histoire-juive-eg.jpg)\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, Jews living in Egypt flourished, growing to as many as 80,000 people who were well-integrated into all aspects of the general society. In this framework, _La Societe d'études historiques juives d'Égypte_ (_Society for the Historical Study of the Jews of Egypt_) was established in 1925.  The Society began publishing a scholarly journal in 1947 entitled _Revue de l'histoire juive en Égypte_ (Review of Jewish History in Egypt). René Cattaui, the leader of the Sephardic Jews of Cairo and president of the Society, played a key role in both of these projects.  In the preface to the journal’s first issue, he opined that the _Revue_ aimed to present a valid historical knowledge of all Jewish movements and groups in Egypt “from their first appearance as the ancient sons of Israel era to the modern times.” The journal sought to cover a range of topics, including political, economic, social, cultural and religious history, and to point out “the strong connection of the Jews to the glorious history of the Nile Valley, which has its roots dating back thousands of years.” The inaugural volume included nine articles written by renowned scholars (including, S. D. Goitein, B. Maisler, M. Schwabe, S. Yeivin, and M. Kamil.) Their studies appeared in English and French, followed by abstracts in Arabic. The first volume was printed on the eve of the momentous events that led to the first war in the Arab-Israeli conflict. It was the first and only issue published. The _Revue_’s demise can be seen as a prelude to the fate of the Jewish community in Egypt in the decades to come.\n\n### The upside-down advertisement: ambiguity toward change in Jewish lifestyle (Tetuan Morocco, 1956)\n\nAviad Moreno\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/or-luz2.png)\n\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century the demographic gap between Jews and non-Jews in the Moroccan city of Tetuan dramatically increased. In 1913 about 4,000 Jews lived among approximately 11,000 Muslims and 3,000 Christian Europeans. By the year 1950, a similar number of Jews lived among 30,000 European and about 47,000 Muslims. The momentous demographic shift transformed moral codes of behaviours, among many other forms of change in Jewish local lifestyle.\n\nAn unexpected indication is the demand for non-kosher foods, as appeared inside the communal periodical _Or-Luz_. It was an advertisement for “Bar Sevilla,” local to Tetuan, clearly stated that it specializes in prawns. The fact that the editors had agreed to publicize the restaurant, or that Bar Sevilla’s owners thought to appeal to Jewish audience through _Or-Luz_, implies that among local Jews in Tetuan, the custom of eating non-Kosher food outside of their homes was probably not a rare occurrence. The advertisement seems to have been met with ambiguity among Luz’s editors, as evidenced by their repeated decision to publish it upside-down. Apparently it is not a misprint, since the practice repeated itself in other issues. 1\n\n### Exploring Moroccan Jewish Sociolinguistic Identities\n\nYigal S. Nizri\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/Nizri-cover.jpg)\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/Nizri-page.jpg)\n\nA blend of historiography, hagiography, chronicle, and ethnography, the Hebrew book Ner Ha-ma'arav: _Toledot Yisra’el be-Maroko_ (\"Light of the West: A History of Jews in Morocco\"), issued by Abraham Moses Luntz at his printing press in Jerusalem in 1911, helped to illuminate new ways of thinking historically about Maghribi (North African) Jewish history. The author, Ya’akov Moshe Toledano (1880-1960) was an Ottoman Palestinian-born Moroccan rabbinic scholar, historian, legislator and public figure.  In the introduction to his book he refers to himself as a \"Man of Tiberius”; he also served as Chief Rabbi in cities like Tangier, Cairo, and Tel Aviv, and was actively engaged with European and North American Jewish intellectual movements of his time. \n\nToledano’s book mainly offers a primary source for exploring Jewish  sociolinguistic identities in late nineteenth-century Morocco, and specifically, how the concept of \"Moroccan Jewry” was shaped linguistically. Unlike the book as a whole, the final chapter contains ethnographic observations about \"the characteristics of Moroccan Jews, their 'ways of being' and habits.\" Toledano provides us with a full description of the languages used by Jews in the Maghreb in the early twentieth century: \"Their spoken language in north-western Morocco is Spanish with a Portuguese accent and Arabic, and in south Morocco, it is Arabic and Shilhit (Berber). The Arabic they speak to each other is blended with many Spanish as well as Hebrew words. The Moroccan Arabic differs from the Arabic of Eastern Jews in many of its words, expressions, and sayings, and an Eastern Jew would not be able to speak with a Maghribi Jew and hardly understand him. Moroccan Jews have a strange and unique pronunciation in Hebrew. Their accent dramatically differs from the articulation of Turkish Jews, and it is more similar to the dialect of the Jews of Palestine...\" \n\nThe uniqueness of this description, in which Toledano uses language as a primary taxonomical device for clarifying the place of spoken Hebrew (\"Moroccan Jews have a strange and unique pronunciation in Hebrew\") lies in the autobiographical stance of the author, whose diasporic-Maghribi formation positioned him both within and outside the community he described.\n\n### An Ottoman Hebrew Musical Testimony from Hebron (Ms. CAJS 436)\n\nEdwin Seroussi\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/Seroussi2.jpg)\n\nPayytanim, whether authors of religious poems (piyyutim; sing. piyyut) or their performers, maintained throughout the Islamic lands manuscript notebooks with the poetical repertoire they sang at synagogues as well as at community and family celebrations. At times, these manuscripts also included written musical terminology that functioned as an aide-mémoire for the singer. This terminology comprised names of Turkish or Arabic musical modes and occasionally rhythmic cycles as well as first lines of foreign songs whose melody applied to the piyyut following such indication. The word lahan (“tune”) usually preceded these melodic codes, meaning, “sing the following piyyut to the tune of this song.”\n\nAlthough Hebrew religious poetry appeared in print since the mid-sixteenth century, the supply of such rare printed books never satisfied the demand. Payytanim therefore copied for their private use poems from printed sources or from other manuscripts while also adding at times their own new poems or poems transmitted to them orally. In the course of time, these manuscripts passed from members of one generation to another, each generation adding more songs in the empty spaces left on the manuscript or inserting more pages to them.\n\nManuscript CAJS 436 is a magnificent exemplar of this type of poetico-musical notebooks found in the Ottoman realm. It belongs to a batch of manuscript collections of piyyutim acquired by the CAJS’s library in recent years. The names of musical modes reflecting the Turkish practice of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attest to the Ottoman pedigree of this manuscript. As customary in these type of collections, the basic repertoire consists of poems by Rabbi Israel Najara (c. 1550-1625) copied from his collections \"Zemirot Israel\" (Safed, 1587; Salonica, 1599/1600; Venice, 1600) and the still unedited \"She’erit Israel.\" Poems by later Ottoman poets, such as Najara’s disciple Avtalyon ben Mordecai, expand the repertoire. The manuscript opens with _makam Rast_, as customary in most collections of this genre. This _makam_ is also the most prominent in the collection in terms of the number of songs included under its rubric.\n\nAs common in these manuscripts, which since their original compilation passed through the hands of many payytanim and manuscript dealers, the pages of CAJS Ms. 436 are disordered and paginations are multiple. The compiler, Refael Hiyya Zeevi (fol. 113a in the most recent pagination) was a scion of one of the renowned Sephardic rabbinical families of Hebron. Although the name “Refael Hiyya” does not appear among the prominent members of this Hebronite family, we can surmise that he is at least connected to (if not the same person as) Rabbi Hiyya Zeevi (d. 1775). In 1773, Rabbi Hiyya Zeevi signed, together with other prominent rabbis of Hebron, a letter sent to Rabbi Eliyahu Hatzarfati of Morocco. The emissary handling the letter was Rabbi Amram ben Diwan, who eventually became a venerated saint in Morocco. In the letter, the Hebron rabbis described the difficult situation of the Jews city (Avraham Yaari, Shluchei Eretz Israel ledorotam, Jerusalem 1951, p. 585).\n\nThe manuscript belonged to Yom Tov Meyuhas (fol. 13b, 123b, 125b), whose identity is also not easy to pinpoint for several members of this prominent Jerusalemite Sephardic family carried this name, usually preceded by another one, such as Yossef or Shmuel.\n\nThe page in our exhibition shows the title of the section in makam Dugâh. I selected this page because the kabbalist Rabbi Menachem di Lonzano (Shtei yadot, Venice 1618, fol. 142a) mentions this Turkish makam specifically as having a transformative power on listeners.\n\nTwo other details are worth mentioning in this very preliminary assessment of Ms. 436, the introductions to the makamlar (Turkish pl. of makam) and the constant renewal of song repertoire. Since the time of Najara, the titles of makam sections open with the formula “petihah le-qol havarat…” as in fol. 52a (original pagination), “petihah le-qol havarat Saba” meaning “opening to the tone \\\\\\[lit. ‘voice of the syllable’\\\\\\] of \\\\\\[makam\\\\\\] Saba.” In fol. 29a we read, however, a less common formulation, “naghm havarat Husseyni.” The use of the Arabic term naghm exposes the more Arabized context in which the compilers of this manuscript operated.\n\nIn fol. 46a we read “pizmonim she-ba’u mi-haleb” namely “songs that came from Aleppo,” an indication of the wide circulation of piyyutim among payytanim throughout the Middle East. In this case, this testimony hints specifically to the gradual transfer of the prestigious Aleppo Hebrew singing tradition to Ottoman Palestine during the nineteenth century. In another instance (fol. 88b), the compiler/later owner announces that this section includes “newer songs” (pizmonim mehudashim), an evidence of the constant regeneration of the religious Hebrew song repertoire in the Ottoman sphere. These new songs are labeled pizmonim, literally a song with refrain, to indicate their lighter, more popular register of style. The song “Yah eli eli yah eli shelah go’ali” (fol. 47b, “My God, send my redeemer”), whose opening/refrain resonates with typical non-sense Arabic syllables for singing (such as ya leil, ya leil, ya ‘eini), is an example of this popular style. Scores of such popular pizmonim found in rare manuscripts such as CAJS Ms. 436 did not survive the passing of time and remained silent testimonies of older local musical practices, in our case those of the Sephardic community of Ottoman Hebron.\n\n### The _B’nai B’rith_ Minutes from The Jamie Lehmann Memorial Collection\n\nAlon Tam\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/tam@2x.jpg)\n\nThese are images of the cover and first page, handwritten in French, of the “Minutes of Cairo Lodge No. 687, B’nei B’rit, Cairo 1911-1912.” The _B’nei B’rit_ is one of the world’s oldest Jewish service organizations, which was established in 1843 in a Jewish coffeehouse in New York City, and its lodges in Egypt were among the first outside the United States. It was modelled after fraternities such as the _Free Masons_, which were popular in the 19th century; women’s lodges of the _B’nei B’rit_ were established in Cairo and Alexandria already in 1939. In Cairo, Lodge 687 was a Sephardi one, established in 1911 after an older lodge, called Magen David, was closed down. An Ashkenazi lodge, called Maimonides, was established in Cairo in 1887. The membership of these Jewish fraternities was made up of the rising commercial and professional middle class in Egypt. They were preoccupied with extensive charity work and community building, as well as with reforming and modernizing the existing Jewish communal organizations, often in opposition to what they saw as a traditional, conservative, and elitist leadership. The _B’nei B’rit_ lodges were also concerned with Jewish cultural revival, advocating for Jewish causes in Egypt and around the world, and contending with the rise of Zionism. The minutes from the meetings of the _B’nei B’rit_ lodges are, therefore, crucial for understanding the social, organizational, and political history of the Jewish community in Egypt in the 20th century.\n\nThe minutes of meetings from both lodge 687, and from the Maimonides lodge (for the years 1924-1928), are both part of Penn’s newly acquired microfilm copy of _The Jamie Lehmann Memorial Collection: Records of the Jewish Community of Cairo, 1886-1961_ at Yeshiva University Libraries. This extensive, albeit fragmented and incomplete, collection consists of account books, by-laws, case files, certificates, correspondence, legal documents, minutes, photographs and reports from various institutions of the Sephardic Jewish community in Cairo, and to a lesser extent, of the Ashkenazi community there as well. The most important institutions featured in this collection are the Jewish Community Council, the Chief Rabbinate, the various charity organizations, and the _B'nai B'rith_ lodges. This makes the Lehmann Collection the most extensive and important archival source that is freely accessible to researchers today about the post-Geniza social and political history of the Jewish community in Egypt.\n\n### Hayim Habshush’s Vision of Yemen\n\nAlan Verskin\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/HayyimHabshush_0.jpg)\n\nHayyim Habshush was a prominent nineteenth-century Jewish scholar from Sanaa, Yemen. He is best known for authoring _A Vision of Yemen_, a book which both chronicles his travels across his country with the French orientalist Joseph Halevy in 1870 and describes the social and political life of the people they encounter, who are mostly Jews but also Muslims. Habshush was a pillar of the Sanaa Jewish community, with an abiding interest in those outside of it. He also maintained an interest in 19th-century European Jewish intellectual debates, and advocated strongly against mysticism and messianic movements among Yemeni Jews. A voracious reader, Habshush would reportedly station himself near the synagogue bookshelf, the better to sneak books to stave off boredom during services. Occasionally, he would even bring Islamic books with him to synagogue to the consternation of the congregation. In this photograph Habshush, dressed in his traveling clothes, poses with a copy of _Ha-Magid_, a European Jewish newspaper.\n\nAt left, author’s photograph of original photograph in Habshush family collection.\n\n### Love in Yemen: Arabic Love Songs of Yemenite Jewish Women\n\nMark Wagner\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/Wagner_0.jpg)\n\nNissim Gamlieli was a Jew from a remote area of Yemen’s hinterlands where a lot of Jews lived in small isolated villages.  He became the librarian for Camp Hashid, a refugee camp jointly run by the British government in Aden and the Jewish Agency for the thousands of Jewish refugees who streamed into British Aden from the Yemeni interior in hopes of emigrating to Palestine.  In Israel he worked as a schoolteacher and published rich studies based on documents and interviews of Jews from his region, many of whom live in Ramla.\n\nGamlieli’s _Love in Yemen: Yemenite Popular Songs—Women’s Songs_, first published in 1974 and reprinted three more times, based upon the author’s interviews with women and men from his region, is a treasure trove of information on popular song and women’s experiences in rural Yemen.  Since Jewish women were largely excluded from the world of traditional Jewish learning, the book also tells us a lot about the lives of Muslim women, their private lives, relationships between the sexes, and other taboo topics.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Esra Almas.** “Disoriented in Istanbul: A Reading of Its Fogscapes Across the Twentieth Century.” _Culture Theory and Critique,_ 2016.\n    \n*   **Esra Almas.** “Framing My Name In Red: Reading a Masterpiece.” In _Global Perspectives on Orhan Pamuk,_ edited by M.

This imaginary convention gathers representatives from all Jewish factions and diasporas (an Ashkenazi, an Italian, a “Talmudic”, etc.) in an attempt to settle timely halakhic, philosophical, and cultural concerns of the Jewish people. The opening page (in the third photo) reveals the author’s implicit prophetic position as a resident of the Holy land, who also traveled through the enlightened countries, and can thus acknowledge the crisis of the Jewish people, formulated in the biblical words: “The earth is violently broken, the earth is split open, the earth is shaken exceedingly” (Isaiah 24:19).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"sefer-zivhe-tsedek-of-r-abdullah-somekh-and-the-baghdadi-jewish-printing-house-of-r-shlomo-bekhor-hutsin\">Sefer Zivhe Tsedek of R. ‘Abdullah Somekh and the Baghdadi Jewish printing house of R.

We have … given \\[the book of Genesis\\] a low price, so that it might be available to all.” This was, however, to be the only book of Torah translation he published, making it somewhat of an exception, given that the bulk of Farhi’s prolific publishing projects were translations from Arabic popular and folk literature, such as the \u003Cem>siyar sha‘biyya\u003C/em> (lit. “folk biographies,” a corpus of Arabic folk epics), which he also considered to serve didactic purposes. Other publishing projects included journals he founded and stories he wrote in the form of parables. By publishing in vernacular Arabic written in Hebrew characters (as most readers did not have facility in either Arabic or Latin scripts) rather than in Hebrew or Standard Arabic (the languages of the lettered elite), Farhi led the trend to democratize the Jewish reading public. Furthermore, by publishing such works, particularly during the early decades of French colonization, Farhi showed that one could be modern—that is, participate fully in the institutions and norms of one’s time—without following a European definition or model of modernity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Acknowledgment to Noam Sienna and Rachel Schine for their insights that contributed to this caption.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"fraught-histories-revue-de-lhistoire-juive-en-égypte\">Fraught Histories: Revue de l’histoire juive en Égypte\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Yoram Meital\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/histoire-juive-eg.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>During the first half of the twentieth century, Jews living in Egypt flourished, growing to as many as 80,000 people who were well-integrated into all aspects of the general society.

René Cattaui, the leader of the Sephardic Jews of Cairo and president of the Society, played a key role in both of these projects.  In the preface to the journal’s first issue, he opined that the \u003Cem>Revue\u003C/em> aimed to present a valid historical knowledge of all Jewish movements and groups in Egypt “from their first appearance as the ancient sons of Israel era to the modern times.” The journal sought to cover a range of topics, including political, economic, social, cultural and religious history, and to point out “the strong connection of the Jews to the glorious history of the Nile Valley, which has its roots dating back thousands of years.” The inaugural volume included nine articles written by renowned scholars (including, S. D. Goitein, B. Maisler, M. Schwabe, S. Yeivin, and M. Kamil.) Their studies appeared in English and French, followed by abstracts in Arabic. The first volume was printed on the eve of the momentous events that led to the first war in the Arab-Israeli conflict. It was the first and only issue published.

The advertisement seems to have been met with ambiguity among Luz’s editors, as evidenced by their repeated decision to publish it upside-down.

The author, Ya’akov Moshe Toledano (1880-1960) was an Ottoman Palestinian-born Moroccan rabbinic scholar, historian, legislator and public figure.  In the introduction to his book he refers to himself as a “Man of Tiberius”; he also served as Chief Rabbi in cities like Tangier, Cairo, and Tel Aviv, and was actively engaged with European and North American Jewish intellectual movements of his time. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Toledano’s book mainly offers a primary source for exploring Jewish  sociolinguistic identities in late nineteenth-century Morocco, and specifically, how the concept of “Moroccan Jewry” was shaped linguistically. Unlike the book as a whole, the final chapter contains ethnographic observations about “the characteristics of Moroccan Jews, their ‘ways of being’ and habits.” Toledano provides us with a full description of the languages used by Jews in the Maghreb in the early twentieth century: “Their spoken language in north-western Morocco is Spanish with a Portuguese accent and Arabic, and in south Morocco, it is Arabic and Shilhit (Berber). The Arabic they speak to each other is blended with many Spanish as well as Hebrew words. The Moroccan Arabic differs from the Arabic of Eastern Jews in many of its words, expressions, and sayings, and an Eastern Jew would not be able to speak with a Maghribi Jew and hardly understand him. Moroccan Jews have a strange and unique pronunciation in Hebrew. Their accent dramatically differs from the articulation of Turkish Jews, and it is more similar to the dialect of the Jews of Palestine…” \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The uniqueness of this description, in which Toledano uses language as a primary taxonomical device for clarifying the place of spoken Hebrew (“Moroccan Jews have a strange and unique pronunciation in Hebrew”) lies in the autobiographical stance of the author, whose diasporic-Maghribi formation positioned him both within and outside the community he described.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"an-ottoman-hebrew-musical-testimony-from-hebron-ms-cajs-436\">An Ottoman Hebrew Musical Testimony from Hebron (Ms. CAJS 436)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Edwin Seroussi\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/Seroussi2.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Payytanim, whether authors of religious poems (piyyutim; sing. piyyut) or their performers, maintained throughout the Islamic lands manuscript notebooks with the poetical repertoire they sang at synagogues as well as at community and family celebrations. At times, these manuscripts also included written musical terminology that functioned as an aide-mémoire for the singer. This terminology comprised names of Turkish or Arabic musical modes and occasionally rhythmic cycles as well as first lines of foreign songs whose melody applied to the piyyut following such indication. The word lahan (“tune”) usually preceded these melodic codes, meaning, “sing the following piyyut to the tune of this song.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although Hebrew religious poetry appeared in print since the mid-sixteenth century, the supply of such rare printed books never satisfied the demand. Payytanim therefore copied for their private use poems from printed sources or from other manuscripts while also adding at times their own new poems or poems transmitted to them orally. In the course of time, these manuscripts passed from members of one generation to another, each generation adding more songs in the empty spaces left on the manuscript or inserting more pages to them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Manuscript CAJS 436 is a magnificent exemplar of this type of poetico-musical notebooks found in the Ottoman realm. It belongs to a batch of manuscript collections of piyyutim acquired by the CAJS’s library in recent years. The names of musical modes reflecting the Turkish practice of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attest to the Ottoman pedigree of this manuscript. As customary in these type of collections, the basic repertoire consists of poems by Rabbi Israel Najara (c. 1550-1625) copied from his collections “Zemirot Israel” (Safed, 1587; Salonica, 1599/1600; Venice, 1600) and the still unedited “She’erit Israel.” Poems by later Ottoman poets, such as Najara’s disciple Avtalyon ben Mordecai, expand the repertoire. The manuscript opens with \u003Cem>makam Rast\u003C/em>, as customary in most collections of this genre. This \u003Cem>makam\u003C/em> is also the most prominent in the collection in terms of the number of songs included under its rubric.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As common in these manuscripts, which since their original compilation passed through the hands of many payytanim and manuscript dealers, the pages of CAJS Ms. 436 are disordered and paginations are multiple. The compiler, Refael Hiyya Zeevi (fol. 113a in the most recent pagination) was a scion of one of the renowned Sephardic rabbinical families of Hebron. Although the name “Refael Hiyya” does not appear among the prominent members of this Hebronite family, we can surmise that he is at least connected to (if not the same person as) Rabbi Hiyya Zeevi (d. 1775). In 1773, Rabbi Hiyya Zeevi signed, together with other prominent rabbis of Hebron, a letter sent to Rabbi Eliyahu Hatzarfati of Morocco. The emissary handling the letter was Rabbi Amram ben Diwan, who eventually became a venerated saint in Morocco. In the letter, the Hebron rabbis described the difficult situation of the Jews city (Avraham Yaari, Shluchei Eretz Israel ledorotam, Jerusalem 1951, p. 585).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The manuscript belonged to Yom Tov Meyuhas (fol. 13b, 123b, 125b), whose identity is also not easy to pinpoint for several members of this prominent Jerusalemite Sephardic family carried this name, usually preceded by another one, such as Yossef or Shmuel.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The page in our exhibition shows the title of the section in makam Dugâh. I selected this page because the kabbalist Rabbi Menachem di Lonzano (Shtei yadot, Venice 1618, fol. 142a) mentions this Turkish makam specifically as having a transformative power on listeners.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Two other details are worth mentioning in this very preliminary assessment of Ms. 436, the introductions to the makamlar (Turkish pl. of makam) and the constant renewal of song repertoire. Since the time of Najara, the titles of makam sections open with the formula “petihah le-qol havarat…” as in fol. 52a (original pagination), “petihah le-qol havarat Saba” meaning “opening to the tone \\[lit. ‘voice of the syllable’\\] of \\[makam\\] Saba.” In fol. 29a we read, however, a less common formulation, “naghm havarat Husseyni.” The use of the Arabic term naghm exposes the more Arabized context in which the compilers of this manuscript operated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In fol. 46a we read “pizmonim she-ba’u mi-haleb” namely “songs that came from Aleppo,” an indication of the wide circulation of piyyutim among payytanim throughout the Middle East. In this case, this testimony hints specifically to the gradual transfer of the prestigious Aleppo Hebrew singing tradition to Ottoman Palestine during the nineteenth century. In another instance (fol. 88b), the compiler/later owner announces that this section includes “newer songs” (pizmonim mehudashim), an evidence of the constant regeneration of the religious Hebrew song repertoire in the Ottoman sphere. These new songs are labeled pizmonim, literally a song with refrain, to indicate their lighter, more popular register of style. The song “Yah eli eli yah eli shelah go’ali” (fol. 47b, “My God, send my redeemer”), whose opening/refrain resonates with typical non-sense Arabic syllables for singing (such as ya leil, ya leil, ya ‘eini), is an example of this popular style. Scores of such popular pizmonim found in rare manuscripts such as CAJS Ms. 436 did not survive the passing of time and remained silent testimonies of older local musical practices, in our case those of the Sephardic community of Ottoman Hebron.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-bnai-brith-minutes-from-the-jamie-lehmann-memorial-collection\">The \u003Cem>B’nai B’rith\u003C/em> Minutes from The Jamie Lehmann Memorial Collection\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Alon Tam\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/tam@2x.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These are images of the cover and first page, handwritten in French, of the “Minutes of Cairo Lodge No. 687, B’nei B’rit, Cairo 1911-1912.” The \u003Cem>B’nei B’rit\u003C/em> is one of the world’s oldest Jewish service organizations, which was established in 1843 in a Jewish coffeehouse in New York City, and its lodges in Egypt were among the first outside the United States.

In Cairo, Lodge 687 was a Sephardi one, established in 1911 after an older lodge, called Magen David, was closed down. An Ashkenazi lodge, called Maimonides, was established in Cairo in 1887. The membership of these Jewish fraternities was made up of the rising commercial and professional middle class in Egypt. They were preoccupied with extensive charity work and community building, as well as with reforming and modernizing the existing Jewish communal organizations, often in opposition to what they saw as a traditional, conservative, and elitist leadership. The \u003Cem>B’nei B’rit\u003C/em> lodges were also concerned with Jewish cultural revival, advocating for Jewish causes in Egypt and around the world, and contending with the rise of Zionism. The minutes from the meetings of the \u003Cem>B’nei B’rit\u003C/em> lodges are, therefore, crucial for understanding the social, organizational, and political history of the Jewish community in Egypt in the 20th century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The minutes of meetings from both lodge 687, and from the Maimonides lodge (for the years 1924-1928), are both part of Penn’s newly acquired microfilm copy of \u003Cem>The Jamie Lehmann Memorial Collection: Records of the Jewish Community of Cairo, 1886-1961\u003C/em> at Yeshiva University Libraries. This extensive, albeit fragmented and incomplete, collection consists of account books, by-laws, case files, certificates, correspondence, legal documents, minutes, photographs and reports from various institutions of the Sephardic Jewish community in Cairo, and to a lesser extent, of the Ashkenazi community there as well. The most important institutions featured in this collection are the Jewish Community Council, the Chief Rabbinate, the various charity organizations, and the \u003Cem>B’nai B’rith\u003C/em> lodges. This makes the Lehmann Collection the most extensive and important archival source that is freely accessible to researchers today about the post-Geniza social and political history of the Jewish community in Egypt.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"hayim-habshushs-vision-of-yemen\">Hayim Habshush’s Vision of Yemen\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Alan Verskin\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/JewsinModernIslamicContexts/HayyimHabshush_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hayyim Habshush was a prominent nineteenth-century Jewish scholar from Sanaa, Yemen. He is best known for authoring \u003Cem>A Vision of Yemen\u003C/em>, a book which both chronicles his travels across his country with the French orientalist Joseph Halevy in 1870 and describes the social and political life of the people they encounter, who are mostly Jews but also Muslims. Habshush was a pillar of the Sanaa Jewish community, with an abiding interest in those outside of it. He also maintained an interest in 19th-century European Jewish intellectual debates, and advocated strongly against mysticism and messianic movements among Yemeni Jews. A voracious reader, Habshush would reportedly station himself near the synagogue bookshelf, the better to sneak books to stave off boredom during services. Occasionally, he would even bring Islamic books with him to synagogue to the consternation of the congregation.

The inherent richness and diversity of the evidence, texts, and materials related to Jewish travel have engaged scholars from a broad range of disciplines and periods (ancient, medieval, and modern history, literature, art and film studies, anthropology, post-colonial and gender studies) in a critical dialogue. Travel writing in particular (in its mimetic, imaginative, and hybrid modes) has served a variety of social and ideological functions throughout the ages, and unquestionably, travels of dislocation and return, pilgrimage, trade and conquest, hold a prominent place in formative Jewish and non-Jewish fictions of identity. What cultural and ideological work is performed by these texts, and how do they produce representations of an-Other and his world, against which and through which they explore and invent a particular sense of self? These are some of the complex themes and challenges that the 2011-12 Katz Fellows addressed, a sampling of which are on display in this year's web exhibit.\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### A Medieval Jewish Merchant Travel Document from the Cairo Genizah\n\nMiriam Frenkel\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/4835_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"See this leaf in the context of Penn's Cairo Genizah Site\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe Jewish merchant, Abraham ben Yiju (known documents: 1132-1156) spent twenty years of his life in India. He imported merchandise from Yemen and from the Eastern Mediterranean countries and exported Indian products. He owned and ran a big workshop of bronze vessels, where Yemenite Jews and local Hindis were employed. Upon returning to Egypt to reunite with his ancestral family, he was accompanied by his Indian wife, Ashu, now bearing the Hebrew name Beracha (blessing) after being converted to Judaism, and with his Hindi chief trade agent Bama.\n\nGeniza document Halper 472 was written by Ben Yiju in 1152, upon his return to Egypt. It contains several lists; some of them register the goods he has brought with him, among them typical Indian products such as gold jewellery, bronze vessels, china wares and perfumes. A kerchief and a pair of shoes were especially brought for Bama. Ben Yiju's biography illustrates the itinerant life style of medieval Jewish traders.\n\n### Legends of the Wandering Jew\n\nGalit Hasan-Rokem\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/hasan-rokem900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe Wandering Jew is said to have been cursed to live forever, punished for not having let Jesus rest on the wall of his house when he was carrying the cross. The roots of this legend lie buried in the early Middle Ages and start to be visible to us from the 13th century on in the monastic chronicle of St Albans in England, _Flores Historiarum_ composed by Roger de Wendover (d. 1236), followed by the _Chronica Majora_ of Matthew Paris (ca. 1200-1259) at the same monastery. As can be learned from George K. Anderson's monumental _The Legend of the Wandering Jew_ (1965) the tale wandered to the continent and was adapted to almost all languages and cultures of Europe.\n\nA particularly well distributed version of the legend emerged in German in the milieu of the Lutheran Reformation. In this version the Wandering Jew's name was Ahasver and he had been a shoemaker in Jerusalem before the curse. This version in numerous variations became the second most popular German chapbook in the 17th century, surpassed only by the chapbook about Dr. Faust. The chapbooks framed the legend from the time of Jesus with contemporary descriptions of Ahasver's appearance in various European cities and included apocalyptic hints about the approaching return of Jesus to this world. In German his most frequent sobriquet was the Eternal _Jew, der ewige Jude_.\n\nIn the French-speaking regions, songs of the _complainte_ genre about _le Juif Errant_ circulated, emphasizing the tragedy of his fate according to the conventions of the genre. Romantic poetry especially in English and in German embraced the somber, lonely figure as an exemplar of unconventionality. A rich array of visual representations were distributed in conjunction with the narratives and songs, or even separately, varying from anti-Semitic stereotypes to sympathetic and respectful representations. In France the Wandering Jew became the title of a serialized novel (1844-1845) by Eugène Sue (1804-1857) in which the figure himself has a minor but rather scurrilous role as the distributor of cholera.\n\nThe picture at left is part of a richly illustrated 4th edition of the novel _Légendes du juif errant et des seize reines de Munster_ (Legends of the wandering Jew and the sixteen queens of Munster) by Jacques Albin Simon Collin de Plancy (1794-1881), which includes a mixture of the elements known from German and French traditions. The illustration is signed by the rather famous E. Lorsay, and the book was printed in 1866 at the workshop of the Parisian typographer Henri Plon; this workshop has survived since 1852 until the present day under various ownerships as a publishing house. In the picture the tailor Jean de Leyde, John (Jan) of Leiden, aka John Bockold or John Bockelson, and a leading figure of the short lived Münster Rebellion, reads a letter brought to him by the Wandering Jew Isaac. This name reminds us of the name Isaac Laquedem \\[here spelled Lakhedem = Isaac from the Orient or Ancient Isaac\\] that appears in many Wandering Jew traditions from the Netherlands and is confirmed later in the novel in the chapter titled \"Le juif errant\") summoning him to join the rebels in Münster. Portraying the Wandering Jew as the messenger might have signaled the utopian apocalyptic vision that characterized this Anabaptist enterprise; however, the rebellion was harshly vanquished and Jean-Jan-John cruelly tortured and executed with the other leaders of the Rebellion. The Wandering Jew apparently continued wandering.\n\n### The Travels of Benjamin of Tudela\n\nMartin Jacobs\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jacobs-bf900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/travels-benjamin-tudela?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jacobs-leaf900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/travels-benjamin-tudela?item=1)\n\nThe Katz Center's Rare Book Room holds a copy of one of the earliest print editions of Benjamin of Tudela's late-twelfth-century itinerary, _Massaʻot shel Rabbi Binyamin_ (מסעות של רבי בנימין), which was published in Freiburg (in the German Breisgau region) by ha-Zifroni in 1583.\n\nAlthough his journey purportedly extended from Iberia to the Middle and Far East we have very few reliable details regarding the life of Benjamin of Tudela. According to the anonymous introduction to his book, he originated from the city of Tudela in Navarre (northern Spain) and returned from his far-flung peregrinations in 1173, which is the only firm date that we have for him. His _Book of Travels_ constitutes one of the earliest Hebrew travel accounts, a genre whose emergence seems to be tied to the Crusades, when the increase in maritime traffic between western Europe and the eastern Mediterranean also included Jewish pilgrims and merchants traveling to the Levant. However, it is far from clear whether Benjamin visited all the places listed in the itinerary. For only the opening lines (according to the Freiburg print depicted here) quote the traveler's own words: \"Rabbi Benjamin ben Jonah ... said: First, I set out from the city of Saragossa and then I went down the River Ebro to Tortosa. From there it took me two days to the ancient city of Tarragona \\[the place names are corrupted\\].\" But then the first-person narrative comes to an abrupt end. Henceforth the Tudelan neither emerges as the protagonist of his travels nor as the book's narrator, which raises a host of questions concerning authorship, editing, and transmission of the work. That said, _Massa‘ot_ offers its readers a description of much of the then-known world, as viewed through a medieval Jewish lens.\n\nFar from falling out of fashion, Benjamin's _Travels_ gained a new lease on life with the advent of Hebrew print and was first brought to press in Constantinople (Istanbul) by Eli‘ezer ben Gershon Soncino in 1543. In fact, the Freiburg edition featured here is based on this _editio princeps_ (and thus repeats some of its errors). Around the same time, Benjamin's itinerary was first translated into Latin and hence became accessible to an early modern Christian audience during the period of New World exploration. This translation titled _Itinerarium Beniamini Tudelensis ... ex Hebraico Latinum factum_ was rendered by Benito Arias Montano, a Spanish humanist and biblical scholar, and published in Antwerp at Christopher Plantin's world-renowned printing house in 1575. The University of Pennsylvania's Rare Book and Manuscript Library Lea Collection indeed holds a copy of this first Latin print of Benjamin's itinerary.\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, Marcus Nathan Adler, took the unprecedented step of basing a critical edition of the Hebrew text (that together with a rather antiquated English translation is still standard today) on several medieval manuscripts: _The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela: Critical Text, Translation and Commentary_ (London: Oxford University Press, 1907).\n\n### The Jewish Discovery of America\n\nLimor Mintz-Manor\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/mintzmanor-vespucci-all-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/jewish-discovery-america?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/mintzmanor-vespucci-select-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/jewish-discovery-america?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/mintzmanor2-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/jewish-discovery-america?item=2)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/AbrahambenMordecaiFarissol-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/jewish-discovery-america?item=3)\n\nThanks to the exceptional generosity of Lawrence J. Schoenberg and Barbara Brizdle, the Penn Libraries recently received a unique sixteenth century manuscript (LJS 42), which contains scientific works in Hebrew written by a Sephardic scholar, Moses ben Baruch Almosnino.\n\nAlmosnino was born probably in 1518 in Salonika to an Aragonese Jewish family which fled Spain after the expulsion decree of 1492 and settled in that Ottoman port city. Almosnino was a Rabbi and a _Posek_ (adjudicator) and one of the prominent leaders of the Jewish communities in Greece, as well as a prolific author who wrote exegetical, historiographical, philosophic and scientific works.\n\nThis sixteenth century manuscript contains two astronomical works together with their commentaries. The first, _Bet elohim_ (House of God), dated no later than 1551, is Almosnino's commentary upon a Medieval Latin astronomical work _De Sphaera_ by Johannes De Sacrobosco, which had been translated into Hebrew during the fourteenth century. Almosnino used Shelomo ben Avram Avigdor's translation entitled _Mar'e ha-'ofanim_. The second work in Almosnino's manuscript is _Sha'ar ha-shamayim_ (Gate of Heaven), which is the author's translation and commentary upon the important fifteenth century astronomical work by Georg Peurbach, _Theoricae Novae Planetarum_.\n\nThe geographical part of the unpublished manuscript copy of _Bet Elohim_ by Almosnino contains two firsts in the history of Hebrew letters concerning the knowledge about the discovery of America. On the verso of folio 23 we find the first mention in Jewish literature of the name Amerigo Vespucci אמריקו וישפוסיאו, whom Almosnino credits as the \"discoverer\" המוצא of America and after whom the newly discovered land is named. This is also the first time that the the name of the continent אמיריקה is mentioned in Hebrew (the name America was first coined by a German cartographer in 1507). Ironically, this discussion of the discovery of the Americas occurs in a commentary on a Medieval Latin astronomical work in which the very existence of the continent was not yet known in Europe.\n\nThe first explicit mention of the new geographical discoveries in the west by a Jewish author is found in the well-known cosmographical work _Iggeret orhot ‘olam_ (A letter concerning the manners of the world) written by Abraham Farissol in 1524. Again, thanks to the philanthropic vision of Lawrence J. Schoenberg and Barbara Brizdle, Penn received a unique contemporary manuscript copy of this work (LJS 499). Farissol's treatise, which was printed for the first time in 1586 in Venice, mentions Columbus' discoveries of some islands in the west and dedicates a whole chapter to the discovery of the New World עולם חדש without mentioning Vespucci's name. Farissol's work is an adaptation of a contemporary Italian book, which in turn relied, for its New World chapters, on a text that came to be known as Vespucci's second letter. Interestingly, there is a previous indication of Columbus' first voyage in Hebrew, which can be found in a personal letter sent from Florence by an Italian Jew as early as 1494!\n\n### Voyages of Enlightenment\n\nIris Idelson-Shein\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/idelsonShein900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nTravel was a ubiquitous trope in the literature of the Jewish Enlightenment. The hazards and travails of travel by sea, and the wonders viewed by those few who dared to set sail to new lands, provided the members of the Jewish Enlightenment—the Maskilim—with a compelling platform for discussing the goals and motivations of their movement, which also embarked on a new and hazardous voyage in Jewish tradition and culture. Thus, the turn of the nineteenth century saw the publication of an abundance of travel stories in Hebrew, Yiddish, and German in Hebrew characters.\n\nThe vast majority of these books were Maskilic translations of German children's books. Displayed here is an emblematic Hebrew translation of two travel stories for children originally written by the German pedagogue Joachim Heinrich Campe. The translation, produced by the Polish Maskil, Menachem Mendel Lefin in 1818, conforms to the translational norms of the Hebrew literary system of the time. It adapts the non-Jewish source text to fit the Maskilic agenda of the Jewish translator, as well as the unique needs of the Hebrew-reading public. In so doing, it reveals some Jewish-specific fantasies and anxieties surrounding such issues as Jewish acculturation, European colonialism, and modern notions of identity and difference.\n\n### Traveling Scroll of the Messiah\n\nOrit Bashkin\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/bashkin900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis ornately encased Torah scroll, an extraordinary gift of Rabbi Ezekiel N. and Margaret Musleah, represents the many travels of Iraqi Jews during the 19th and 20th centuries. The integration of Iraq into the modern economy in the 19th century brought new trading opportunities for Iraqi Jews. British trade provided the network through which they subsequently established satellite communities in Bombay, Calcutta, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Affluent families from these Indian-Iraqi- Jewish communities made financial contributions to support various synagogues and schools in Baghdad. They kept the Baghdadi tradition alive in Southeast Asia (in terms of ritual and daily practice), and are still referred to as \"Baghdadis\" by Jews and non-Jews alike.\n\nThis community also established a print industry that published books and journals in Judeo-Arabic for a Baghdadi Jewish readership. Jews in Baghdad often traveled to the East to serve as rabbis, and cantors, and to provide services the local communities needed, while written products from India and Hong Kong often traveled to Baghdad. Hakham Rav Mordecai Shindookh (1770-1852), the scribe and religious authority who specially created this visionary, diminutive Torah scroll to be used in the future by the Messiah during his travels throughout the world, was a prominent representative of this Baghdadi Jewish community in Calcutta. Rabbi Ezekiel N. and Margaret Musleah, now living in Philadelphia and formerly of Calcutta, are descendants of Baghdadi rabbinic scholars, including Hakham Rav Shindookh who was a progenitor of Margaret (nee Shindookh) Musleah. The Musleah family donated this precious family heirloom, kept in the family for six generations, to the Library at the Katz Center on the first day of Hanukkah in December of 2011..\n\n### Traveler Accounts of the \"Jews' Place of Wail\"—the Western Wall in Jerusalem\n\nElliott Horowitz\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/horowitzBergheim900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn 1840 the Irish physician William Wilde (1815-76), after traveling throughout the Mediterranean, singled out Jewish prayer at the Western Wall as one of the scenes that had most moved him. \"Were I asked what was the object of the greatest interest that I had seen, and the scene that made the deepest impression on me, during my sojourn in other lands,\" wrote Dr. Wilde (father of the future playwright), \"I would say that it was a Jew mourning over the stones of Jerusalem.\"\n\nAt around the same time the American biblical scholar and archaeologist Edward Robinson, who had traveled throughout Palestine during the late 1830s, described his visit to the \"Jews' Place of Wail\" on a Wednesday afternoon. He saw there only \"two old men\" who \"sat there upon the ground, reading together in a book of Hebrew prayers,\" but added that \"on Fridays they assemble here in greater numbers.\" Robinson, who was a professor at New York's Union Theological Seminary, wrote of the Jews' \"touching custom\" at \"the nearest point in which they can venture to approach their their ancient temple,\" where \"bowed in the dust, they may at least weep undisturbed over the fallen glory of their race; and bedew with tears the soil, which so many thousands of their forefathers once moistened with blood\" \\[E. Robinson, Biblical Researches in Palestine, v. 1 (1841), 349-40\\].\n\n### Travel by Post\n\nAsher Salah\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/salah900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis postcard was mailed on August 17, 1880 to the rabbi Sabato Morais (1823-1897) in Philadelphia by the rabbi of Mantua Marco Mortara (1815-1894). Mortara, unable to write following a cataract operation, dictated the text to his son Ludovico (1855-1937), a distinguished jurist and Italian politician. It is one of the very first postal cards issued by the recently established Kingdom of Italy, only six year after they were first printed in 1874. Graphic illustrations on the postcard are negligible; only the national emblem and the image of the stamp appear. It would be ten more years before the first private picture postcards were introduced into the market.\n\nThe interest of this particular postcard is twofold. On one hand it shows the appearance of a means of communication that will threaten the existence of the lengthy, erudite letter on scientific matters that contributed significantly to the development of the Wissenshaft des Judentums (\"Science of Judaism\") on a European scale. On the other hand, it attests to the intellectual exchange of two Italian rabbis living on two sides of the Atlantic whose professional careers followed substantially different paths. Mortara represents the sedentary type of rabbi, deep-rooted in the territorial reality of his provincial community, who never left his city during the whole span of his active life. Morais is one of the last and renowned examples of an Italian port Jewish rabbi, in the line of David Nieto or Raphael Meldola before him, who was widely traveled (Morais was born in Livorno, lived in London, then moved to the United States in 1851. He is best known as the principal founder of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York in 1886). By the turn of the century, both types would be outdated by the radical demographic and cultural changes undergone by Italian Jewry. Ironically, Mortara and Morais had been illustrious authors who corresponded in the traditional manner of scholarly exchange at the precise historical period during which, at the end of nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, the postcard was disrupting the dynamics of intellectual sociability that were built through the erudite letter.\n\n### Jerusalem from the East: Heaven and Earth\n\nOra Limor\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/limor3781-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis photograph of Jerusalem, found in the Lenkin Family Collection of Photography at the Library at the Katz Center, was taken by an anonymous photographer, probably after 1898. It was taken from the east, from a point at the top of the Mount of Olives, whose lower slopes, with some olive and pine trees, are visible in the lower portion of the photograph. The picture is divided into two almost equal parts, the sky above and the land below. The southern and eastern walls of the city bound the built-up area, dominated by the golden cupola of the Dome of the Rock, with the south eastern corner of the wall in the exact center of the picture. Only the minarets and church spires break into the skyline. Below the eastern wall, between the brighter built-up area and the Mount of Olives, is the Valley of Joshaphat, hinted at, rather than seen, in the dark. The sky, loaded with heavy clouds, dominates the scene, rendering the city a spiritual idea, an emblematic space, in which the earthly Jerusalem and the heavenly city become one.\n\n### From the Ottoman Empire to America\n\nJulia Phillips Cohen\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cohen-149.gif\" alt=\"See facsimile (pdf)\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nDuring the last decades of the nineteenth century, individual Ottoman Jews began to make their way to the United States in search of economic opportunity. Among them were merchants who sold their wares at the world's fairs held in Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis in 1876, 1893, and 1904, respectively, only to remain in the country and try their luck at earning a living in the New World. By the first decade of the twentieth century, the numbers of Jews entering the United States from Ottoman lands skyrocketed. The new waves of emigration were propelled by a number of factors, including a new universal military conscription law announced by the Ottoman government following the \"Young Turk\" revolution of 1908, the expulsion of Italian Jewish subjects long resident in the empire during the Italian-Ottoman War of 1911, the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913, compulsory military conscription in Greece in 1916, and a massive fire that devastated the historic Jewish quarter of Salonica in 1917.\n\nThese and various other factors, including the continued search for economic betterment as well as political freedoms—a consideration which was particularly relevant for the active Jewish socialists of Salonica—brought as many as 60,000 Jews from Ottoman and formerly Ottoman territories to the United States by 1924, when the American government all but closed its doors to immigrants from southern and eastern Europe.\n\nBy this time, Jews of Ottoman origin had formed communities in various cities across the United States, including Seattle, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia, although the greater New York area remained the epicenter of the new Ottoman Jewish émigré populations. These communities settled in particular districts and established various religious institutions and places of leisure of their own, often organizing themselves according to their cities of origin in the Old World. At the same time, a Ladino newspaper, _La Amerika_, offered the new Judeo- Spanish-speaking immigrants among them a shared, virtual community by 1910.\n\nWithin a year, a number of self-appointed leaders of these new Jewish immigrant groups joined forces with communal elites from the established Jewish communities of New York to create an organization they hoped would attend to the particular needs of the Greek-, Arabic-, and Ladino-speaking Jews who had recently arrived in the United States from the Ottoman Empire and its successor states in southeastern Europe. Although the organization was founded as \"The Federation of the Oriental Jews of America\" in 1912, the founders had drafted a proposed constitution for their fledgling organization already in 1911: an original typescript copy of this document forms part of the Arnold and Deanne Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica at the Library at the Katz Center in Philadelphia. In this text, we get a glimpse of the concerns of the organization's founders, who sought to accelerate the assimilation of the recent Levantine Jewish immigrants to the United States by offering night classes in English, while also discouraging any political debates that might alienate the new immigrants from one another, or from their new government.\n\n### Traveling Jewish Soldiers\n\nNils Roemer\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/roemer900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nOne of the most unusual places for publication of Jewish art, _Skizzen aus Litauen, Weissrussland und Kurland_ (1916), is dedicated to the infantry of General Erich Ludendorf. The experience of war and destruction paradoxically also served German Jewish soldiers to \"discover\" Eastern European Jews.\n\nWorking for the press office of the German Army Supreme Command for the East, the German writer Herbert Eulenberg and German Jewish artist Hermann Struck created a wide canvas of Lithuanian farmers as well as Latvian and Polish women and men. They detailed in broad strokes the Jews of Eastern Europe.\n\nStruck's images illustrate, within the appearance of an individual, the fate of Jews in the Diaspora. Image and text pay homage to Amsterdam and the art of Rembrandt, whom Struck had encountered when traveling to Amsterdam. The books's illustrations draw attention to encounter, traveling, and exploration as important facets of Jewish cultures and creativity.\n\n### Hayyim Shoshkes and the World of Travel Journalism\n\nJack Kugelmass\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/kugelmass-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn the introduction to his 1954 book _Durkh umbakante lender_ Hayyim Shoshkes relates a childhood memory of the family gathered over dinner and listening to his father read aloud from a newspaper report about the latest skirmishes in the Spanish-American War. The six-year-old future travel writer was particularly taken by the account of Cuba's beauty and the illuminated entryway to Havana—descriptions that carried his imagination away to far-off places:\n\n> At night I dreamed that my wooden horse that stood right next to my bed, took on another form, became large and began to move. . . . Wings sprouted from the horse's back and it became like a creature called Pegasus found in my picture book. I sit on him and he carried me to unfamiliar Cuba, I am lifted higher and higher and fly over the ruins of the Land of Israel and the temples of Baghdad, the city of my storybooks. . . . I fly ever farther, cut through a forest filled with wild animals and jump up with a frightful scream. . . . Next to me stands my father, holds and comforts me. I tell him my dream and he says: \"That means, my child, that you will sprout wings, you'll travel a lot, you'll see a great deal! This was a good dream, you have nothing to be afraid of.\"\n\nAvraham Shoshkes's prophecy did come to pass and for a good forty years his son Hayyim or Henry Shoshkes—as he often called himself— proved to be a ceaseless wanderer and prolific travel writer with some 25 published books to his name, at least half about his journeys, and these mostly compilations of his newspaper reportages about Latin America, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Poland and the Soviet Union. His only rival for the title that his friend S. L. Shneiderman conferred on him in a powerful eulogy, that of \"the last of the great Jewish wanderers,\" is Peretz Hirshbein (1880-1948) eleven years his senior, who traveled as extensively, though perhaps not as doggedly, as Shoshkes and published on South and North America, Russia, India and Israel, but whose creative activity was more divided among various talents, from poet and novelist to playwright and travel writer.\n\nShoshkes's literary talent was undiluted, his writerly ambitions entirely devoted to journalism. But what most distinguishes Shoshkes's oeuvre from Hirshbein's is how closely tied his journeys were to Jewish relief work, and how preoccupied the writing to the social, political, and economic situation of Jews far removed from the center of their people's lives— whose welfare, until his dying day, remained the core of his project.\n\n_Lender in shtet_ is Shoshkes's first compilation, based on travel accounts he wrote between 1924 and 1927. The book is divided into nine sections each devoted to a different region and begins with a five short pieces on the World Exposition in Wembley. Included in the book are reportages that appear over and again in his writings—Egypt, Israel, North Africa and Syria. Less common are his pieces on Spain, Italy and the Balkans since in his later writing Shoshkes preferred more exotic locales. Probably the most interesting section in the book is the final one titled Poyln. These nineteen pieces, which were written in connection with his travels to Poland's periphery on behalf of the cooperative banking movement, contain some of Shoshkes's most interesting work. They demonstrate how the consummate travel writer hardly needs a foreign locale to work his craft but they also suggest how exotic the periphery must have seemed to many of Shoshkes's readers in Warsaw's Jewish daily newspaper _Haynt_.\n\n### In Search of a Gaze\n\nVered Madar\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/madar-YemeniteArtisticPlaiting900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/search-gaze?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/madar-JewishGirl900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/search-gaze?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/madar-YemeniteBeauty900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/search-gaze?item=2)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/madar-YemeniteChief900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/search-gaze?item=3)\n\nThese four portraits of Yemenite Jews in Mandate Palestine come from a collection of approximately 1,250 Holy Land postcards at the library at the Katz Center. The collection was begun during the 1930s by Gualtiero Cividalli, a Florentine Jewish businessman who took his family to Palestine following the rise of fascism in Italy. His daughter Paola continued to build the collection along with many other images and texts related to the Holy Land. Paola and her husband Bertrand Lazard donated these postcards, as well as hundreds of books and maps about the Holy Land, to the Penn Libraries in 2010.\n\nThe Paola and Bertrand Lazard Holy Land collection abounds in images of sites holy to Jews, Christians, and Muslims, but there are surprisingly few portrait postcards. The fact that what few portraits appear in the collection are most often of Jews from Yemen reveals what has been called the \"gaze\" of the observer. This term is often found in post-colonial studies and critiques of Orientalism which analyze the problems and questions arising from the way the non-western world and its inhabitants have been represented, constructed, and re-constructed in the photographs taken of them by western travelers. Instead of focusing on the \"gaze\" of the \"western\" observer, however, here we have an opportunity to think about the gaze of those being observed.\n\nNotice that the only figure actually looking at us \\[the observers\\], in an amalgamation of sadness and rebuke, is the male. The gazes of the three women represented in these postcards as Yemenite are not turning their eyes to look at us. It is as if they were exotic curiosities staged for display. The absence of their direct look can be understood as a result of their shyness, modesty, and religious or cultural restrictions. It can also be understood instrumentally, assuming that the focus of these photographs is the Yemenite garments or handcrafts and not the women as subjects. This juxtaposition exposes the additional problematic layer of women's representation compared to that of men. Women more than men served, and still do, as objects to observe; it is not just the quantity but also the quality of the representation. Devoting my work to extracting women's voices has made me listen frequently to what seems at first like silence, but then echoes multiple voices. Engaging with these Yemenite women's \"non-gazes\" can make us, the observers, see them as objects, but it can also force us to look inside ourselves. Indirect-gaze observation results here in an \"about face\" that may make us feel uncomfortable and can force us into self-reflection. This self-reflection offers a way to \"ask\" these women to turn their faces and direct their gaze toward the camera so we can look into their eyes and see not just ourselves but also them.\n\n### _The Land of Israel_ (1936): A Journey in Black and White\n\nAnat Zanger\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/zanger-149.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe short film (11 minutes) \"The Land of Israel\" (AKA \"The Wedding\") was made during the 1930s. Following the tradition of the travelogue, the film focuses on events and places that took place in pre-state Israel during a visit that lasted a few months. The footage has no voice-over to accompany the visual, but the traveler's authoritative official tone and his emphases are present through the captions, that divide the photographed pilgrimage into a few chapters, each one dealing with a different place or event. Among them are: We Enter Haifa Port; Jerusalem: A Panorama of the Old City; A Wedding in the Holy City; and Wilderness of the Desert. The black and white images with their hallucinatory quality produce an interesting mélange of reality and dream, while the images themselves are occasionally in a dialogue with the existing imagery of the Holy Land as a primordial landscape, especially those of Jerusalem and the desert (see for example the drawings of David Robert).\n\nTravel and cinema have a long history, dating back to the late nineteenth century, to the very inception of the cinematic medium. Travel developed as an intrinsic form of cinema, consonant with common expressions and coinings such as \"travelling shot\" which has to do with shooting within a movement, and the term \"motion picture\" itself. While film and photography were developed in tandem with industrialized modes of transportation (trains, automobiles etc.) the journey became one of cinema's most popular tropes (see Jeffrey Ruoff, 2006). From _The Arrival of a Train at la Ciotat_ (Lumière Brothers, 1885) and _The Voyage to the Moon_ (Georges Méliès, 1902) to _Description of a Struggle_ (Chris Marker, 1960), _La Bas_ (English title Down There, Chantal Akerman, 2006) and _The Band's Visit_ (Eran Kolirin, 2007) the journey has been developed not only as a genre that was produced by the grand studios, but also as a tool for documentation and expression by independent filmmakers and individuals who made travelogues, home-movies, and filmed diaries, using non-professional equipment. In this sense, \"The Land of Israel\" is an early and rare example of such a documentation. But despite the individual quality of this production, it seems that the film is produced in line with the norms of the nonfiction films of its period, as well as the Zionist movement. Thus it creates an account in which the objective \"voice of truth\" (Roland Barthes, 1970) of his journey prevails, while dealing with \"the Land of Israel\" as part of the \"grand narrative\" of return.\n\nFollowing Zali Gurevitch, we may observe two types of time: the \"big time\" of Jewish tradition and history, and the \"small time\" of the everyday. The \"Israeli present,\" says Gurevitch, \"resists the present, denies the everyday. Not that there is no everyday: there is a routine, \\[...\\] but as a cultural articulation or experience it remains open, like a book which refuses to be finished.\" (2007: 84, my translation). Interestingly, the short film focuses mainly on events and occurrences that belong to the \"big time\" of Jewish holidays and pre-state Israel, such as the Festival of Purim in Tel Aviv; the Tu Bishvat holiday; and Succoth. In this context, human figures and faces are present in the film most of the time as part of the \"big events:\" that of the wedding, the Purim festivity, and the announcing of the start of the Sabbath in a Jerusalem street. However, some other moments emerge along the traditional \"big time\" - those depicting daily life, which also include some local faces: the women bathing in the Dead Sea, seen from a distance, and the smiling faces of two young religious boys from _Mea She'arim_ that will reappear thirty years later both in the film made by a French director Chris Marker—_Description of a Struggle_ (1960) and later on, in the film of an Israeli film director, David Perlov—_In Jerusalem_ (1963). At the rear plain of some frames from Jerusalem and the desert, one can discern that the \"contact zone,\" (Pratt) which existed between the traveler and the locals, also contained Palestinians and Bedouin, as a passing line of camels or donkeys, or just as shadows seen from a distant point.\n\nInterestingly, the filmmaker did not sign his name in the film. All we know is that he was a Hebrew Union College rabbinical student whose family name was Green.\n\n### Hearts of Darkness\n\nEitan Bar-Yosef\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/bar-yosef900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nShimon Tzabar (1926-2007) was an Israeli artist, poet and journalist whose travel account _How I Discovered Africa_ was published in 1958, just as Israel—under the guidance of Foreign Minister Golda Meir—turned to postcolonial Black Africa in search of friendship and commerce. Tzabar's Introduction reminds us how the Israeli encounter with Africa was shaped by European perceptions of the \"Dark Continent.\" This voyage, Tzabar playfully explains, was in fact his fifth journey to Africa: the first took place in a boat called \"Tarzan's Adventures,\" when Shimon—then a toddler—reached a jungle teeming with African natives and wild animals. In later journeys he followed the African expeditions set out in Friedrich Wilhelm Mader's Ophir and in Henryk Sienkiewicz's _In Desert and Wilderness_ (both translated into Hebrew in the 1920s), before joining the exciting treasure-hunt narrated by another Israeli writer-illustrator, Nahum Gutman, author of _In the Land of Lobgengulu King of Zulu_ (1939).\n\nNevertheless, while Tzabar's sense of adventure and his beautiful ink drawings echo the colonial discursive and visual tradition which marks these \"earlier\" journeys, his real achievement lies in his ability to transcend the familiar stock of derogatory stereotypes. It is telling that, following the 1967 war, Tzabar was one of the first to denounce the Israeli occupation: exiled in London, he founded a satirical journal called _Israel Imperial News_—a new mouthpiece, he claimed, required for the new Israeli \"empire.\" One is left to wonder whether Tzabar recognized the complex relationship between his bitter depiction of \"colonial\" Israel and the unabashedly nostalgic tone with which he lovingly recalled his first expeditions to Africa.\n\n### Inscribed Travel: the visitor book at the Ammunition Hill National Memorial site in Jerusalem\n\nChaim Noy\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/noy900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe commemorative visitors' book at the Ammunition Hill National Memorial Site in Jerusalem offers distinctly symbolic Jewish surfaces on which visitors write and from which they read. Visitors' entries suggest a powerful connection between two symbolic systems, the first associated with Jewish belief and practices, and the second associated with Zionism as a national Jewish movement. This connection is not new, but the volumes' interactive surfaces suggest highly ritualistic practices of both writing and reading, whereby visitors perform in a few words, usually accompanied by an image, how these systems of symbols come together in creating an identity and alignment with National Israeli commemoration.\n\n### Christian Travelers to the Holy Land and their Jewish-Israeli Tour Guides\n\nJackie Feldman\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/feldman-stanne-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/christian-travelers-holy-land-and-their-jewish-israeli?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/feldman-templemt-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/christian-travelers-holy-land-and-their-jewish-israeli?item=1)\n\nContemporary Christian pilgrimages to the Holy Land are often guided by Jewish-Israeli tour guides, whose performances mediate between Christian believers and their sacra. While guides specialize in telling seductive stories of the sites, they are often caught up in their own performances in ways that affect them outside the frame of the tour. In the top photo, a Jewish guide provides the introduction to a Christian pilgrimage prior to their entrance into St. Anne's Church in Jerusalem.\n\nPanoramic viewing of places mentioned in Scripture, accompanied by Bible readings, help constitute ways of seeing, especially for Protestant pilgrims to the Holy Land. The Jewish guide plays an important role in shaping this vision, by tracing out the group's walking path through landmarks referenced in scripture, here (bottom photo) from the Mount of Olives. His display of familiarity with the Biblical text and the Hebrew language mark him as authoritative witness and endow him with a spiritual role in the voyage.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Adler, Elkan Nathan.** _Jews in many lands._ Philadelphia : Jewish Publication Society of America, 1905\n    \n*   **Adler, Elkan Nathan (editor).** _Jewish travelers._ New York : Bloch Pub.

The inherent richness and diversity of the evidence, texts, and materials related to Jewish travel have engaged scholars from a broad range of disciplines and periods (ancient, medieval, and modern history, literature, art and film studies, anthropology, post-colonial and gender studies) in a critical dialogue. Travel writing in particular (in its mimetic, imaginative, and hybrid modes) has served a variety of social and ideological functions throughout the ages, and unquestionably, travels of dislocation and return, pilgrimage, trade and conquest, hold a prominent place in formative Jewish and non-Jewish fictions of identity. What cultural and ideological work is performed by these texts, and how do they produce representations of an-Other and his world, against which and through which they explore and invent a particular sense of self? These are some of the complex themes and challenges that the 2011-12 Katz Fellows addressed, a sampling of which are on display in this year’s web exhibit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"a-medieval-jewish-merchant-travel-document-from-the-cairo-genizah\">A Medieval Jewish Merchant Travel Document from the Cairo Genizah\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Miriam Frenkel\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/4835_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"See this leaf in the context of Penn&#x27;s Cairo Genizah Site\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The Jewish merchant, Abraham ben Yiju (known documents: 1132-1156) spent twenty years of his life in India. He imported merchandise from Yemen and from the Eastern Mediterranean countries and exported Indian products. He owned and ran a big workshop of bronze vessels, where Yemenite Jews and local Hindis were employed. Upon returning to Egypt to reunite with his ancestral family, he was accompanied by his Indian wife, Ashu, now bearing the Hebrew name Beracha (blessing) after being converted to Judaism, and with his Hindi chief trade agent Bama.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Geniza document Halper 472 was written by Ben Yiju in 1152, upon his return to Egypt. It contains several lists; some of them register the goods he has brought with him, among them typical Indian products such as gold jewellery, bronze vessels, china wares and perfumes. A kerchief and a pair of shoes were especially brought for Bama. Ben Yiju’s biography illustrates the itinerant life style of medieval Jewish traders.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"legends-of-the-wandering-jew\">Legends of the Wandering Jew\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Galit Hasan-Rokem\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/hasan-rokem900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The Wandering Jew is said to have been cursed to live forever, punished for not having let Jesus rest on the wall of his house when he was carrying the cross. The roots of this legend lie buried in the early Middle Ages and start to be visible to us from the 13th century on in the monastic chronicle of St Albans in England, \u003Cem>Flores Historiarum\u003C/em> composed by Roger de Wendover (d. 1236), followed by the \u003Cem>Chronica Majora\u003C/em> of Matthew Paris (ca. 1200-1259) at the same monastery. As can be learned from George K. Anderson’s monumental \u003Cem>The Legend of the Wandering Jew\u003C/em> (1965) the tale wandered to the continent and was adapted to almost all languages and cultures of Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A particularly well distributed version of the legend emerged in German in the milieu of the Lutheran Reformation. In this version the Wandering Jew’s name was Ahasver and he had been a shoemaker in Jerusalem before the curse. This version in numerous variations became the second most popular German chapbook in the 17th century, surpassed only by the chapbook about Dr. Faust. The chapbooks framed the legend from the time of Jesus with contemporary descriptions of Ahasver’s appearance in various European cities and included apocalyptic hints about the approaching return of Jesus to this world. In German his most frequent sobriquet was the Eternal \u003Cem>Jew, der ewige Jude\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the French-speaking regions, songs of the \u003Cem>complainte\u003C/em> genre about \u003Cem>le Juif Errant\u003C/em> circulated, emphasizing the tragedy of his fate according to the conventions of the genre. Romantic poetry especially in English and in German embraced the somber, lonely figure as an exemplar of unconventionality. A rich array of visual representations were distributed in conjunction with the narratives and songs, or even separately, varying from anti-Semitic stereotypes to sympathetic and respectful representations. In France the Wandering Jew became the title of a serialized novel (1844-1845) by Eugène Sue (1804-1857) in which the figure himself has a minor but rather scurrilous role as the distributor of cholera.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The picture at left is part of a richly illustrated 4th edition of the novel \u003Cem>Légendes du juif errant et des seize reines de Munster\u003C/em> (Legends of the wandering Jew and the sixteen queens of Munster) by Jacques Albin Simon Collin de Plancy (1794-1881), which includes a mixture of the elements known from German and French traditions. The illustration is signed by the rather famous E. Lorsay, and the book was printed in 1866 at the workshop of the Parisian typographer Henri Plon; this workshop has survived since 1852 until the present day under various ownerships as a publishing house. In the picture the tailor Jean de Leyde, John (Jan) of Leiden, aka John Bockold or John Bockelson, and a leading figure of the short lived Münster Rebellion, reads a letter brought to him by the Wandering Jew Isaac. This name reminds us of the name Isaac Laquedem [here spelled Lakhedem = Isaac from the Orient or Ancient Isaac] that appears in many Wandering Jew traditions from the Netherlands and is confirmed later in the novel in the chapter titled “Le juif errant”) summoning him to join the rebels in Münster. Portraying the Wandering Jew as the messenger might have signaled the utopian apocalyptic vision that characterized this Anabaptist enterprise; however, the rebellion was harshly vanquished and Jean-Jan-John cruelly tortured and executed with the other leaders of the Rebellion. The Wandering Jew apparently continued wandering.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-travels-of-benjamin-of-tudela\">The Travels of Benjamin of Tudela\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Martin Jacobs\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/travels-benjamin-tudela?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jacobs-bf900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/travels-benjamin-tudela?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jacobs-leaf900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Katz Center’s Rare Book Room holds a copy of one of the earliest print editions of Benjamin of Tudela’s late-twelfth-century itinerary, \u003Cem>Massaʻot shel Rabbi Binyamin\u003C/em> (מסעות של רבי בנימין), which was published in Freiburg (in the German Breisgau region) by ha-Zifroni in 1583.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although his journey purportedly extended from Iberia to the Middle and Far East we have very few reliable details regarding the life of Benjamin of Tudela. According to the anonymous introduction to his book, he originated from the city of Tudela in Navarre (northern Spain) and returned from his far-flung peregrinations in 1173, which is the only firm date that we have for him. His \u003Cem>Book of Travels\u003C/em> constitutes one of the earliest Hebrew travel accounts, a genre whose emergence seems to be tied to the Crusades, when the increase in maritime traffic between western Europe and the eastern Mediterranean also included Jewish pilgrims and merchants traveling to the Levant. However, it is far from clear whether Benjamin visited all the places listed in the itinerary. For only the opening lines (according to the Freiburg print depicted here) quote the traveler’s own words: “Rabbi Benjamin ben Jonah … said: First, I set out from the city of Saragossa and then I went down the River Ebro to Tortosa. From there it took me two days to the ancient city of Tarragona [the place names are corrupted].” But then the first-person narrative comes to an abrupt end. Henceforth the Tudelan neither emerges as the protagonist of his travels nor as the book’s narrator, which raises a host of questions concerning authorship, editing, and transmission of the work. That said, \u003Cem>Massa‘ot\u003C/em> offers its readers a description of much of the then-known world, as viewed through a medieval Jewish lens.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Far from falling out of fashion, Benjamin’s \u003Cem>Travels\u003C/em> gained a new lease on life with the advent of Hebrew print and was first brought to press in Constantinople (Istanbul) by Eli‘ezer ben Gershon Soncino in 1543. In fact, the Freiburg edition featured here is based on this \u003Cem>editio princeps\u003C/em> (and thus repeats some of its errors). Around the same time, Benjamin’s itinerary was first translated into Latin and hence became accessible to an early modern Christian audience during the period of New World exploration. This translation titled \u003Cem>Itinerarium Beniamini Tudelensis … ex Hebraico Latinum factum\u003C/em> was rendered by Benito Arias Montano, a Spanish humanist and biblical scholar, and published in Antwerp at Christopher Plantin’s world-renowned printing house in 1575. The University of Pennsylvania’s Rare Book and Manuscript Library Lea Collection indeed holds a copy of this first Latin print of Benjamin’s itinerary.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At the turn of the twentieth century, Marcus Nathan Adler, took the unprecedented step of basing a critical edition of the Hebrew text (that together with a rather antiquated English translation is still standard today) on several medieval manuscripts: \u003Cem>The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela: Critical Text, Translation and Commentary\u003C/em> (London: Oxford University Press, 1907).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-jewish-discovery-of-america\">The Jewish Discovery of America\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Limor Mintz-Manor\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/jewish-discovery-america?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/mintzmanor-vespucci-all-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/jewish-discovery-america?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/mintzmanor-vespucci-select-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/jewish-discovery-america?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/mintzmanor2-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/jewish-discovery-america?item=3\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/AbrahambenMordecaiFarissol-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thanks to the exceptional generosity of Lawrence J.

The first, \u003Cem>Bet elohim\u003C/em> (House of God), dated no later than 1551, is Almosnino’s commentary upon a Medieval Latin astronomical work \u003Cem>De Sphaera\u003C/em> by Johannes De Sacrobosco, which had been translated into Hebrew during the fourteenth century. Almosnino used Shelomo ben Avram Avigdor’s translation entitled \u003Cem>Mar’e ha-‘ofanim\u003C/em>. The second work in Almosnino’s manuscript is \u003Cem>Sha’ar ha-shamayim\u003C/em> (Gate of Heaven), which is the author’s translation and commentary upon the important fifteenth century astronomical work by Georg Peurbach, \u003Cem>Theoricae Novae Planetarum\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The geographical part of the unpublished manuscript copy of \u003Cem>Bet Elohim\u003C/em> by Almosnino contains two firsts in the history of Hebrew letters concerning the knowledge about the discovery of America. On the verso of folio 23 we find the first mention in Jewish literature of the name Amerigo Vespucci אמריקו וישפוסיאו, whom Almosnino credits as the “discoverer” המוצא of America and after whom the newly discovered land is named. This is also the first time that the the name of the continent אמיריקה is mentioned in Hebrew (the name America was first coined by a German cartographer in 1507). Ironically, this discussion of the discovery of the Americas occurs in a commentary on a Medieval Latin astronomical work in which the very existence of the continent was not yet known in Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first explicit mention of the new geographical discoveries in the west by a Jewish author is found in the well-known cosmographical work \u003Cem>Iggeret orhot ‘olam\u003C/em> (A letter concerning the manners of the world) written by Abraham Farissol in 1524. Again, thanks to the philanthropic vision of Lawrence J. Schoenberg and Barbara Brizdle, Penn received a unique contemporary manuscript copy of this work (LJS 499). Farissol’s treatise, which was printed for the first time in 1586 in Venice, mentions Columbus’ discoveries of some islands in the west and dedicates a whole chapter to the discovery of the New World עולם חדש without mentioning Vespucci’s name. Farissol’s work is an adaptation of a contemporary Italian book, which in turn relied, for its New World chapters, on a text that came to be known as Vespucci’s second letter. Interestingly, there is a previous indication of Columbus’ first voyage in Hebrew, which can be found in a personal letter sent from Florence by an Italian Jew as early as 1494!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"voyages-of-enlightenment\">Voyages of Enlightenment\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Iris Idelson-Shein\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/idelsonShein900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Travel was a ubiquitous trope in the literature of the Jewish Enlightenment. The hazards and travails of travel by sea, and the wonders viewed by those few who dared to set sail to new lands, provided the members of the Jewish Enlightenment—the Maskilim—with a compelling platform for discussing the goals and motivations of their movement, which also embarked on a new and hazardous voyage in Jewish tradition and culture. Thus, the turn of the nineteenth century saw the publication of an abundance of travel stories in Hebrew, Yiddish, and German in Hebrew characters.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The vast majority of these books were Maskilic translations of German children’s books. Displayed here is an emblematic Hebrew translation of two travel stories for children originally written by the German pedagogue Joachim Heinrich Campe. The translation, produced by the Polish Maskil, Menachem Mendel Lefin in 1818, conforms to the translational norms of the Hebrew literary system of the time. It adapts the non-Jewish source text to fit the Maskilic agenda of the Jewish translator, as well as the unique needs of the Hebrew-reading public. In so doing, it reveals some Jewish-specific fantasies and anxieties surrounding such issues as Jewish acculturation, European colonialism, and modern notions of identity and difference.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"traveling-scroll-of-the-messiah\">Traveling Scroll of the Messiah\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Orit Bashkin\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/bashkin900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>This ornately encased Torah scroll, an extraordinary gift of Rabbi Ezekiel N. and Margaret Musleah, represents the many travels of Iraqi Jews during the 19th and 20th centuries. The integration of Iraq into the modern economy in the 19th century brought new trading opportunities for Iraqi Jews. British trade provided the network through which they subsequently established satellite communities in Bombay, Calcutta, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Affluent families from these Indian-Iraqi- Jewish communities made financial contributions to support various synagogues and schools in Baghdad. They kept the Baghdadi tradition alive in Southeast Asia (in terms of ritual and daily practice), and are still referred to as “Baghdadis” by Jews and non-Jews alike.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This community also established a print industry that published books and journals in Judeo-Arabic for a Baghdadi Jewish readership. Jews in Baghdad often traveled to the East to serve as rabbis, and cantors, and to provide services the local communities needed, while written products from India and Hong Kong often traveled to Baghdad. Hakham Rav Mordecai Shindookh (1770-1852), the scribe and religious authority who specially created this visionary, diminutive Torah scroll to be used in the future by the Messiah during his travels throughout the world, was a prominent representative of this Baghdadi Jewish community in Calcutta. Rabbi Ezekiel N. and Margaret Musleah, now living in Philadelphia and formerly of Calcutta, are descendants of Baghdadi rabbinic scholars, including Hakham Rav Shindookh who was a progenitor of Margaret (nee Shindookh) Musleah. The Musleah family donated this precious family heirloom, kept in the family for six generations, to the Library at the Katz Center on the first day of Hanukkah in December of 2011..\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"traveler-accounts-of-the-jews-place-of-wailthe-western-wall-in-jerusalem\">Traveler Accounts of the “Jews’ Place of Wail”—the Western Wall in Jerusalem\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Elliott Horowitz\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/horowitzBergheim900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>In 1840 the Irish physician William Wilde (1815-76), after traveling throughout the Mediterranean, singled out Jewish prayer at the Western Wall as one of the scenes that had most moved him. “Were I asked what was the object of the greatest interest that I had seen, and the scene that made the deepest impression on me, during my sojourn in other lands,” wrote Dr. Wilde (father of the future playwright), “I would say that it was a Jew mourning over the stones of Jerusalem.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At around the same time the American biblical scholar and archaeologist Edward Robinson, who had traveled throughout Palestine during the late 1830s, described his visit to the “Jews’ Place of Wail” on a Wednesday afternoon. He saw there only “two old men” who “sat there upon the ground, reading together in a book of Hebrew prayers,” but added that “on Fridays they assemble here in greater numbers.” Robinson, who was a professor at New York’s Union Theological Seminary, wrote of the Jews’ “touching custom” at “the nearest point in which they can venture to approach their their ancient temple,” where “bowed in the dust, they may at least weep undisturbed over the fallen glory of their race; and bedew with tears the soil, which so many thousands of their forefathers once moistened with blood” [E. Robinson, Biblical Researches in Palestine, v. 1 (1841), 349-40].\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"travel-by-post\">Travel by Post\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Asher Salah\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/salah900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>This postcard was mailed on August 17, 1880 to the rabbi Sabato Morais (1823-1897) in Philadelphia by the rabbi of Mantua Marco Mortara (1815-1894). Mortara, unable to write following a cataract operation, dictated the text to his son Ludovico (1855-1937), a distinguished jurist and Italian politician. It is one of the very first postal cards issued by the recently established Kingdom of Italy, only six year after they were first printed in 1874. Graphic illustrations on the postcard are negligible; only the national emblem and the image of the stamp appear. It would be ten more years before the first private picture postcards were introduced into the market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The interest of this particular postcard is twofold. On one hand it shows the appearance of a means of communication that will threaten the existence of the lengthy, erudite letter on scientific matters that contributed significantly to the development of the Wissenshaft des Judentums (“Science of Judaism”) on a European scale. On the other hand, it attests to the intellectual exchange of two Italian rabbis living on two sides of the Atlantic whose professional careers followed substantially different paths. Mortara represents the sedentary type of rabbi, deep-rooted in the territorial reality of his provincial community, who never left his city during the whole span of his active life. Morais is one of the last and renowned examples of an Italian port Jewish rabbi, in the line of David Nieto or Raphael Meldola before him, who was widely traveled (Morais was born in Livorno, lived in London, then moved to the United States in 1851. He is best known as the principal founder of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York in 1886). By the turn of the century, both types would be outdated by the radical demographic and cultural changes undergone by Italian Jewry. Ironically, Mortara and Morais had been illustrious authors who corresponded in the traditional manner of scholarly exchange at the precise historical period during which, at the end of nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, the postcard was disrupting the dynamics of intellectual sociability that were built through the erudite letter.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"jerusalem-from-the-east-heaven-and-earth\">Jerusalem from the East: Heaven and Earth\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Ora Limor\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/limor3781-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>This photograph of Jerusalem, found in the Lenkin Family Collection of Photography at the Library at the Katz Center, was taken by an anonymous photographer, probably after 1898. It was taken from the east, from a point at the top of the Mount of Olives, whose lower slopes, with some olive and pine trees, are visible in the lower portion of the photograph. The picture is divided into two almost equal parts, the sky above and the land below. The southern and eastern walls of the city bound the built-up area, dominated by the golden cupola of the Dome of the Rock, with the south eastern corner of the wall in the exact center of the picture. Only the minarets and church spires break into the skyline. Below the eastern wall, between the brighter built-up area and the Mount of Olives, is the Valley of Joshaphat, hinted at, rather than seen, in the dark. The sky, loaded with heavy clouds, dominates the scene, rendering the city a spiritual idea, an emblematic space, in which the earthly Jerusalem and the heavenly city become one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"from-the-ottoman-empire-to-america\">From the Ottoman Empire to America\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Julia Phillips Cohen\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cohen-149.gif\" alt=\"See facsimile (pdf)\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>During the last decades of the nineteenth century, individual Ottoman Jews began to make their way to the United States in search of economic opportunity. Among them were merchants who sold their wares at the world’s fairs held in Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis in 1876, 1893, and 1904, respectively, only to remain in the country and try their luck at earning a living in the New World. By the first decade of the twentieth century, the numbers of Jews entering the United States from Ottoman lands skyrocketed. The new waves of emigration were propelled by a number of factors, including a new universal military conscription law announced by the Ottoman government following the “Young Turk” revolution of 1908, the expulsion of Italian Jewish subjects long resident in the empire during the Italian-Ottoman War of 1911, the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913, compulsory military conscription in Greece in 1916, and a massive fire that devastated the historic Jewish quarter of Salonica in 1917.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These and various other factors, including the continued search for economic betterment as well as political freedoms—a consideration which was particularly relevant for the active Jewish socialists of Salonica—brought as many as 60,000 Jews from Ottoman and formerly Ottoman territories to the United States by 1924, when the American government all but closed its doors to immigrants from southern and eastern Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By this time, Jews of Ottoman origin had formed communities in various cities across the United States, including Seattle, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia, although the greater New York area remained the epicenter of the new Ottoman Jewish émigré populations. These communities settled in particular districts and established various religious institutions and places of leisure of their own, often organizing themselves according to their cities of origin in the Old World. At the same time, a Ladino newspaper, \u003Cem>La Amerika\u003C/em>, offered the new Judeo- Spanish-speaking immigrants among them a shared, virtual community by 1910.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Within a year, a number of self-appointed leaders of these new Jewish immigrant groups joined forces with communal elites from the established Jewish communities of New York to create an organization they hoped would attend to the particular needs of the Greek-, Arabic-, and Ladino-speaking Jews who had recently arrived in the United States from the Ottoman Empire and its successor states in southeastern Europe. Although the organization was founded as “The Federation of the Oriental Jews of America” in 1912, the founders had drafted a proposed constitution for their fledgling organization already in 1911: an original typescript copy of this document forms part of the Arnold and Deanne Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica at the Library at the Katz Center in Philadelphia. In this text, we get a glimpse of the concerns of the organization’s founders, who sought to accelerate the assimilation of the recent Levantine Jewish immigrants to the United States by offering night classes in English, while also discouraging any political debates that might alienate the new immigrants from one another, or from their new government.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"traveling-jewish-soldiers\">Traveling Jewish Soldiers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Nils Roemer\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/roemer900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>One of the most unusual places for publication of Jewish art, \u003Cem>Skizzen aus Litauen, Weissrussland und Kurland\u003C/em> (1916), is dedicated to the infantry of General Erich Ludendorf.

The six-year-old future travel writer was particularly taken by the account of Cuba’s beauty and the illuminated entryway to Havana—descriptions that carried his imagination away to far-off places:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>At night I dreamed that my wooden horse that stood right next to my bed, took on another form, became large and began to move… .

I sit on him and he carried me to unfamiliar Cuba, I am lifted higher and higher and fly over the ruins of the Land of Israel and the temples of Baghdad, the city of my storybooks… . I fly ever farther, cut through a forest filled with wild animals and jump up with a frightful scream… . Next to me stands my father, holds and comforts me. I tell him my dream and he says: “That means, my child, that you will sprout wings, you’ll travel a lot, you’ll see a great deal! This was a good dream, you have nothing to be afraid of.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Avraham Shoshkes’s prophecy did come to pass and for a good forty years his son Hayyim or Henry Shoshkes—as he often called himself— proved to be a ceaseless wanderer and prolific travel writer with some 25 published books to his name, at least half about his journeys, and these mostly compilations of his newspaper reportages about Latin America, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Poland and the Soviet Union. His only rival for the title that his friend S. L. Shneiderman conferred on him in a powerful eulogy, that of “the last of the great Jewish wanderers,” is Peretz Hirshbein (1880-1948) eleven years his senior, who traveled as extensively, though perhaps not as doggedly, as Shoshkes and published on South and North America, Russia, India and Israel, but whose creative activity was more divided among various talents, from poet and novelist to playwright and travel writer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Shoshkes’s literary talent was undiluted, his writerly ambitions entirely devoted to journalism. But what most distinguishes Shoshkes’s oeuvre from Hirshbein’s is how closely tied his journeys were to Jewish relief work, and how preoccupied the writing to the social, political, and economic situation of Jews far removed from the center of their people’s lives— whose welfare, until his dying day, remained the core of his project.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Lender in shtet\u003C/em> is Shoshkes’s first compilation, based on travel accounts he wrote between 1924 and 1927. The book is divided into nine sections each devoted to a different region and begins with a five short pieces on the World Exposition in Wembley. Included in the book are reportages that appear over and again in his writings—Egypt, Israel, North Africa and Syria. Less common are his pieces on Spain, Italy and the Balkans since in his later writing Shoshkes preferred more exotic locales. Probably the most interesting section in the book is the final one titled Poyln. These nineteen pieces, which were written in connection with his travels to Poland’s periphery on behalf of the cooperative banking movement, contain some of Shoshkes’s most interesting work. They demonstrate how the consummate travel writer hardly needs a foreign locale to work his craft but they also suggest how exotic the periphery must have seemed to many of Shoshkes’s readers in Warsaw’s Jewish daily newspaper \u003Cem>Haynt\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"in-search-of-a-gaze\">In Search of a Gaze\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Vered Madar\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/search-gaze?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/madar-YemeniteArtisticPlaiting900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/search-gaze?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/madar-JewishGirl900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/search-gaze?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/madar-YemeniteBeauty900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/search-gaze?item=3\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/madar-YemeniteChief900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These four portraits of Yemenite Jews in Mandate Palestine come from a collection of approximately 1,250 Holy Land postcards at the library at the Katz Center. The collection was begun during the 1930s by Gualtiero Cividalli, a Florentine Jewish businessman who took his family to Palestine following the rise of fascism in Italy. His daughter Paola continued to build the collection along with many other images and texts related to the Holy Land. Paola and her husband Bertrand Lazard donated these postcards, as well as hundreds of books and maps about the Holy Land, to the Penn Libraries in 2010.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Paola and Bertrand Lazard Holy Land collection abounds in images of sites holy to Jews, Christians, and Muslims, but there are surprisingly few portrait postcards. The fact that what few portraits appear in the collection are most often of Jews from Yemen reveals what has been called the “gaze” of the observer. This term is often found in post-colonial studies and critiques of Orientalism which analyze the problems and questions arising from the way the non-western world and its inhabitants have been represented, constructed, and re-constructed in the photographs taken of them by western travelers. Instead of focusing on the “gaze” of the “western” observer, however, here we have an opportunity to think about the gaze of those being observed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Notice that the only figure actually looking at us [the observers], in an amalgamation of sadness and rebuke, is the male. The gazes of the three women represented in these postcards as Yemenite are not turning their eyes to look at us. It is as if they were exotic curiosities staged for display. The absence of their direct look can be understood as a result of their shyness, modesty, and religious or cultural restrictions. It can also be understood instrumentally, assuming that the focus of these photographs is the Yemenite garments or handcrafts and not the women as subjects. This juxtaposition exposes the additional problematic layer of women’s representation compared to that of men. Women more than men served, and still do, as objects to observe; it is not just the quantity but also the quality of the representation. Devoting my work to extracting women’s voices has made me listen frequently to what seems at first like silence, but then echoes multiple voices. Engaging with these Yemenite women’s “non-gazes” can make us, the observers, see them as objects, but it can also force us to look inside ourselves. Indirect-gaze observation results here in an “about face” that may make us feel uncomfortable and can force us into self-reflection. This self-reflection offers a way to “ask” these women to turn their faces and direct their gaze toward the camera so we can look into their eyes and see not just ourselves but also them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-land-of-israel-1936-a-journey-in-black-and-white\">\u003Cem>The Land of Israel\u003C/em> (1936): A Journey in Black and White\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Anat Zanger\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/zanger-149.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The short film (11 minutes) “The Land of Israel” (AKA “The Wedding”) was made during the 1930s. Following the tradition of the travelogue, the film focuses on events and places that took place in pre-state Israel during a visit that lasted a few months. The footage has no voice-over to accompany the visual, but the traveler’s authoritative official tone and his emphases are present through the captions, that divide the photographed pilgrimage into a few chapters, each one dealing with a different place or event. Among them are: We Enter Haifa Port; Jerusalem: A Panorama of the Old City; A Wedding in the Holy City; and Wilderness of the Desert. The black and white images with their hallucinatory quality produce an interesting mélange of reality and dream, while the images themselves are occasionally in a dialogue with the existing imagery of the Holy Land as a primordial landscape, especially those of Jerusalem and the desert (see for example the drawings of David Robert).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Travel and cinema have a long history, dating back to the late nineteenth century, to the very inception of the cinematic medium. Travel developed as an intrinsic form of cinema, consonant with common expressions and coinings such as “travelling shot” which has to do with shooting within a movement, and the term “motion picture” itself. While film and photography were developed in tandem with industrialized modes of transportation (trains, automobiles etc.) the journey became one of cinema’s most popular tropes (see Jeffrey Ruoff, 2006). From \u003Cem>The Arrival of a Train at la Ciotat\u003C/em> (Lumière Brothers, 1885) and \u003Cem>The Voyage to the Moon\u003C/em> (Georges Méliès, 1902) to \u003Cem>Description of a Struggle\u003C/em> (Chris Marker, 1960), \u003Cem>La Bas\u003C/em> (English title Down There, Chantal Akerman, 2006) and \u003Cem>The Band’s Visit\u003C/em> (Eran Kolirin, 2007) the journey has been developed not only as a genre that was produced by the grand studios, but also as a tool for documentation and expression by independent filmmakers and individuals who made travelogues, home-movies, and filmed diaries, using non-professional equipment. In this sense, “The Land of Israel” is an early and rare example of such a documentation. But despite the individual quality of this production, it seems that the film is produced in line with the norms of the nonfiction films of its period, as well as the Zionist movement. Thus it creates an account in which the objective “voice of truth” (Roland Barthes, 1970) of his journey prevails, while dealing with “the Land of Israel” as part of the “grand narrative” of return.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Following Zali Gurevitch, we may observe two types of time: the “big time” of Jewish tradition and history, and the “small time” of the everyday. The “Israeli present,” says Gurevitch, “resists the present, denies the everyday. Not that there is no everyday: there is a routine, […] but as a cultural articulation or experience it remains open, like a book which refuses to be finished.” (2007: 84, my translation). Interestingly, the short film focuses mainly on events and occurrences that belong to the “big time” of Jewish holidays and pre-state Israel, such as the Festival of Purim in Tel Aviv; the Tu Bishvat holiday; and Succoth. In this context, human figures and faces are present in the film most of the time as part of the “big events:” that of the wedding, the Purim festivity, and the announcing of the start of the Sabbath in a Jerusalem street. However, some other moments emerge along the traditional “big time” - those depicting daily life, which also include some local faces: the women bathing in the Dead Sea, seen from a distance, and the smiling faces of two young religious boys from \u003Cem>Mea She’arim\u003C/em> that will reappear thirty years later both in the film made by a French director Chris Marker—\u003Cem>Description of a Struggle\u003C/em> (1960) and later on, in the film of an Israeli film director, David Perlov—\u003Cem>In Jerusalem\u003C/em> (1963). At the rear plain of some frames from Jerusalem and the desert, one can discern that the “contact zone,” (Pratt) which existed between the traveler and the locals, also contained Palestinians and Bedouin, as a passing line of camels or donkeys, or just as shadows seen from a distant point.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interestingly, the filmmaker did not sign his name in the film. All we know is that he was a Hebrew Union College rabbinical student whose family name was Green.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"hearts-of-darkness\">Hearts of Darkness\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Eitan Bar-Yosef\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/bar-yosef900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Shimon Tzabar (1926-2007) was an Israeli artist, poet and journalist whose travel account \u003Cem>How I Discovered Africa\u003C/em> was published in 1958, just as Israel—under the guidance of Foreign Minister Golda Meir—turned to postcolonial Black Africa in search of friendship and commerce. Tzabar’s Introduction reminds us how the Israeli encounter with Africa was shaped by European perceptions of the “Dark Continent.” This voyage, Tzabar playfully explains, was in fact his fifth journey to Africa: the first took place in a boat called “Tarzan’s Adventures,” when Shimon—then a toddler—reached a jungle teeming with African natives and wild animals. In later journeys he followed the African expeditions set out in Friedrich Wilhelm Mader’s Ophir and in Henryk Sienkiewicz’s \u003Cem>In Desert and Wilderness\u003C/em> (both translated into Hebrew in the 1920s), before joining the exciting treasure-hunt narrated by another Israeli writer-illustrator, Nahum Gutman, author of \u003Cem>In the Land of Lobgengulu King of Zulu\u003C/em> (1939).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Nevertheless, while Tzabar’s sense of adventure and his beautiful ink drawings echo the colonial discursive and visual tradition which marks these “earlier” journeys, his real achievement lies in his ability to transcend the familiar stock of derogatory stereotypes. It is telling that, following the 1967 war, Tzabar was one of the first to denounce the Israeli occupation: exiled in London, he founded a satirical journal called \u003Cem>Israel Imperial News\u003C/em>—a new mouthpiece, he claimed, required for the new Israeli “empire.” One is left to wonder whether Tzabar recognized the complex relationship between his bitter depiction of “colonial” Israel and the unabashedly nostalgic tone with which he lovingly recalled his first expeditions to Africa.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"inscribed-travel-the-visitor-book-at-the-ammunition-hill-national-memorial-site-in-jerusalem\">Inscribed Travel: the visitor book at the Ammunition Hill National Memorial site in Jerusalem\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Chaim Noy\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/noy900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The commemorative visitors’ book at the Ammunition Hill National Memorial Site in Jerusalem offers distinctly symbolic Jewish surfaces on which visitors write and from which they read.

This connection is not new, but the volumes’ interactive surfaces suggest highly ritualistic practices of both writing and reading, whereby visitors perform in a few words, usually accompanied by an image, how these systems of symbols come together in creating an identity and alignment with National Israeli commemoration.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"christian-travelers-to-the-holy-land-and-their-jewish-israeli-tour-guides\">Christian Travelers to the Holy Land and their Jewish-Israeli Tour Guides\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jackie Feldman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/christian-travelers-holy-land-and-their-jewish-israeli?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/feldman-stanne-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jews-journeys/christian-travelers-holy-land-and-their-jewish-israeli?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103450im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/feldman-templemt-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Contemporary Christian pilgrimages to the Holy Land are often guided by Jewish-Israeli tour guides, whose performances mediate between Christian believers and their sacra.

On the one hand, there are literatures in Jewish languages, principally Hebrew, Yiddish and Ladino. On the other, there are Jewish literatures in Russian, German, French, Arabic, English and many other vernacular languages. American Jewish literature, while belonging to the latter category, seems to delimit a sphere of its own reflecting, especially in recent decades, the “difference” of American Jewry. We examined with great interest how in each of these cases the choice of the linguistic medium determines the intended audience and in turn affects the message about Jewish identity and culture. In all instances, we saw literature as a site of intense struggle around the question of Jewishness and modernity in which all the resources of the linguistic imagination were called into play to negotiate the passage from traditional society to contemporary life. What, then, is Jewish literature? Is it one or many? Are there viable criteria for determining what lies within and without the bounds of Jewish literature? These questions, perhaps in the end unanswerable, do not cease to engage us.\n\nAlan Mintz\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### I Did Not Interview the Dead\n\nAlan Rosen\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Rosen%20%281%29.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nDavid Boder's _I Did Not Interview the Dead_ (U of Illinois Press, 1949) contains eight interviews with displaced persons. A Latvian Jewish émigré to America, Boder traveled to Europe in 1946 to carry out 109 interviews of Holocaust victims--interviews that he conducted in seven languages. Seventy English transcriptions totaling some 3100 pages were eventually brought out by Boder. _I Did Not Interview the Dead_ offered a sample of the massive project. The book jacket displayed here won a graphic arts award for its haunting design.\n\nThe interplay between Jewish and non-Jewish languages forms a crucial dimension of Boder's Eastern European origins, education and training; his academic focus on the relation between language and trauma; his aspiration to found a new genre of world literature that he defined, nevertheless, under the rubric of Torah; the complex evolution of the multilingual interviews into a monolingual text; and the puzzling reception of his work, which has relegated the issues of language to the periphery. Boder's focus on language, multilingualism and Jewish notions of tradition and textuality form a key to his approach to Holocaust testimony.\n\n### _Schmerz der Liebe (Pain of Love)_\n\nLiliane Weissberg\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Weissberg170.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Weissberg1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nRebecca Salomon was born 1783, the daughter of one of the most prominent Jewish bankers and businessmen in Berlin. She married the son of David Friedlaender, one of the leaders of the Jewish community in Berlin, but divorced him after a brief marriage, and began to write and publish popular novels under a pen name, Regina Frohberg. She later took this name as her legal one.\n\nFrohberg, who lived in Berlin and later Vienna, can be considered the first German-Jewish novelist. Most of her fiction deals with the aristocratic milieu, and offers love stories with complicated plot lines; they can be compared to generic Romance novels of today. But some of the plots--as that of the present book, _Schmerz der Liebe_ (Pain of Love)--offered an additional interest for readers in the know. _Schmerz der Liebe_ translated gossip relating to members of the Jewish community into the aristocratic sphere. Thus, Frohberg's work provides an interesting insight into Jewish life around 1800, and her project of assimilation.\n\n### Rewriting Rebecca\n\nMaurice Samuels\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/samuels.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nNineteenth-century historical novels―such as Walter Scott's _Ivanhoe_ (1818), in which the beautiful Rebecca is carried off against her will by a Templar Knight―often depict the foundation of the modern nation state through the persecution of an exoticized Jewess. But what happens when a nineteenth-century Jewish woman writer takes up the genre of historical fiction? Eugénie Foa, née Esther-Rebecca-Eugénie Rodgrigues-Henriques (1796-1853), from a prominent Sephardic family of Bordeaux, wrote a series of historical fictions in the 1830s and 40s from the perspective of Jewish women who struggle to find a place between tradition and modernity, between religious and national identity. The first Jew to write fiction in French, Foa exploited her difference to claim a unique place in the literary field of nineteenth-century France. The popular genre of the historical novel provided her with a means of furthering both her political/ideological agenda―to promote Jewish assimilation in France―and her personal/professional one―to live, against all odds, by her pen.\n\n### Grace Aguilar's _Vale of Cedars_\n\nNadia Valman\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Valman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Valman1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n_The Vale of Cedars; or, The Martyr_, by the Anglo-Jewish novelist and poet Grace Aguilar and published posthumously in 1850, was the first popular English novel on a Jewish historical theme. Written when the author was still in her late teens, the novel displays Aguilar's astute manipulation of the genre of historical romance to serve the cause of Anglo-Jewish religious pride and political emancipation.\n\nAguilar's novel, set in Inquisition Spain, was designed to appeal to readers of Sir Walter Scott's hugely successful tale of medieval England, _Ivanhoe_ (1819), in focusing on the plight of a beautiful young Jewish woman struggling with her desire for a gentile knight and enduring persecution for resisting conversion to Christianity. _The Vale of Cedars_, alongside Aguilar's other fictional and devotional writings, was intended to counter the literary efforts of Evangelical conversionists who frequently represented the Jewess as particularly amenable – and susceptible - to conversion. Aguilar's heroine, in contrast, is a crypto-Jewess who passes as a Catholic courtier while remaining loyal to her own religion. Instead of desiring conversion to Christianity, she longs to be liberated from her life of disguise and to embrace Judaism publicly. She was a metaphor for Anglo-Jews who, in early Victorian England, had to choose between religion and citizenship.\n\nYet in her writing, Aguilar did not so much depart from the model of Evangelical literature as draw upon it. In particular, she utilised a key trope of Evangelical fiction for women: their reverence for femininity, female companionship, and female moral force. In _The Vale of Cedars_, the heroine, pursued and tortured by the Inquisition, is (with implausible poetic license) protected by the maternal figure of Queen Isabella. The Queen reproaches her courtiers for their disapproval of her compassion for Marie: 'Has every spark of woman's nature faded from your hearts, that ye can speak thus? ... Detest, abhor, avoid her faith - for that we command thee; but her sex, her sorrow, have a claim to sympathy and aid, which not even her race can remove'. In Aguilar's fiction, differences of 'faith' or 'race' could be transcended by the universalist ideology of femininity.\n\n### Pax Vobiscum\n\nMarc Caplan\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/mCaplan.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/pax-vobiscum?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/mCaplan1-170.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/pax-vobiscum?item=1)\n\nMore than a pen-name, Sholem Aleichem is the alter-ego, or literary persona, of Sholem Rabinovitsh (1859-1916), who through this creation has become known as the greatest Yiddish writer, and the most outstanding humorist in modern Jewish literature. The name \"Sholem Aleichem\" itself means, alternately, \"Peace Be Unto You\" or \"How d'you do\" it's a greeting offered in Yiddish, and Hebrew, to a familiar person with whom one is nonetheless not in constant contact. \"Sholem Aleichem\" is not a daily greeting, like \"hello\" or \"good afternoon,\" but rather the greeting offered to a person one hasn't seen in several days. As a pseudonym or alternate identity, it thus suggests familiarity and distance at one and the same time, and this combination is essential to Sholem Aleichem's enduring popularity, as well as his deceptively satirical comic vision.\n\nAmong his many achievements, Sholem Aleichem must rank among the most prolific figures in modern Jewish literature; the standard edition of his \"complete\" works runs to 28 volumes, and even this collection is marred by several glaring omissions. His most famous and critically regarded narratives include _Tevye the Milkman_, _The_ _Letters of Menakhem-Mendl and Sheyne-Sheyndl_, _Motl the Cantor Peyse's Son_, and the _Railroad Stories_. Although Sholem Aleichem began his career with the aspiration of creating for Yiddish literature something analogous to Honoré de Balzac's Comédie humaine--a grand cycle of realist novels portraying a civilization in its entirety--the works on which his reputation rests are in fact sequences of monologues (or in the case of the Menakhem-Mendl sequence, letters that read like monologues) narrated typically by marginal figures with an incomplete understanding of their situation. Their literary quality derives from the author's mastery of a super-idiomatic Yiddish that sounds like everyday speech, but evokes tragicomic echoes of traditional Jewish learning, juxtaposed against the fragmentation and confusion of Jewish Eastern Europe in the midst of industrial modernization, political instability, and mass emigration.\n\nIn addition to the best known and most canonical of Sholem Aleichem's tale sequences, another series of stories meriting reappraisal is the group of satirical tales he wrote describing the general character of life in the fictional shtetl Kasrilevke. Although most contemporary critics have focused their attention to Sholem Aleichem on the most explicitly dynamic narratives in his body of work, the Kasrilevke stories reiterate exhaustively--and to considerable comic effect--the essentially static, immobile aspects of traditional Jewish life. When taken as a particular genre, the Kasrilevke stories evoke not only a location, but an inverted presence, a revocation of the dynamism that characterizes Jewish modernity and Sholem Aleichem's (or rather, Rabinovitsh's) political convictions. The Kasrilevke sequence therefore presents a rejoinder to the ideological ferment of early-20th century Eastern European life. How Sholem Aleichem conceptualizes this space is a crucial issue because precisely the control of space, territory, is the central preoccupation of all the modern ideologies to which the Kasrilevke stories obliquely and subversively respond.\n\n### The Melting Pot\n\nMichael P. Kramer\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Kramer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nCauldrons and crucibles existed as symbols of immigration well before Anglo-Jewish novelist and playwright Israel Zangwill penned his popular melodrama, _The Melting Pot_, first staged in 1908. In this _Puck_ cartoon of 1889, 'The Mortar of Assimilation ― and the One Element that Won't Mix, Lady Liberty stirs the tub of citizenship, and a recalicitrant Irish revolutionary dances on the rim.\n\nBut it was Zangwill's play that made the melting pot the central term in the discourse of immigration and assimilation. Lauded by President Theodore Roosevelt and denounced by countless American rabbis, _The Melting Pot_ dramatizes the ideal of Americanzation in the love-conquers-all story of David Quixano, a young Russian Jewish musician whose family was killed in the Kishinev pogrom, and Vera Revendal, a beautiful Russian Christian whose father masterminded the massacre. Ironically, the one element that doesn't mix in the play is not an immigrant but Quincy Davenport, a descendant of the Puritan founders and David's mirror opposite, whose decadence and immorality make him unfit to inherit his ancestors' legacy.\n\n### À la recherche du juif perdu\n\nScott Lerner\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Lerner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Lerner2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nYosef Yerushalmi tells the story of his discovery, in the Sigmund Freud Archives in Washington DC, of the family Bible that Freud's father Jakob first inscribed, in Hebrew, on the occasion of Sigmund Freud's circumcision. Thirty-five years later, the elder Freud had the volume re-bound in leather, and he added a dedication to his son, by hand and in Hebrew, composed as a _melitzah_―a traditional genre in Hebrew letters consisting of an arrangement of textual bits drawn from the Bible and other Jewish sources. Yerushalmi appears to believe―though he does not insist―that this dedication offers strong evidence of the Freud's ability to read and understand Hebrew, Freud's statements to the contrary notwithstanding. Yerushalmi calls Freud's writing of _Moses and Monotheism_ an act of \"'deferred obedience'\" to a paternal \"'mandate.'\" The _melitzah_ written by Jakob Freud in 1896 directed Sigmund to return to the book and to reengage his Jewish origins. At a distance of thirty-eight years, the son obeyed the father by radically rewriting the history that constitutes and preserves the Jews as a people. How, we might wonder, would his father, the author of the _melitzah_, have received _Moses and Monotheism_ in fulfillment of his mandate? Yerushalmi thinks that Jakob Freud \"would not have been displeased.\" One thing seems clear, however. If _Moses and Monotheism_ may be understood as a satisfactory fulfillment of a mandate to return to Jewish history and origins, then obedience, in this context, does not preclude subversion.\n\nIn Proust, remarkably, many of these same elements are present. Proust's Charles Swann is a paradigm of assimilation, especially in the French context, where assimilation is best measured by the standard of the severest gatekeepers of _francité_ (Frenchness): the high aristocracy. The vexed question of Swann's Jewishness is definitely resolved in _Sodome et Gomorrhe_ when, at the height of the Dreyfus Affair, the narrator describes him as degrading facially to the point where he resembles an \"old Hebrew rather than a dilettante Valois.\" Nearing death, Swann returns \"to the spiritual fold of his fathers\" \\['au bercail religieux de ses pères'\\] and arrives \"at the age of the prophet.\"\n\nIf Swann is thus like Sigmund Freud, a Jew whose Judaism may be \"terminated,\" but whose Jewishness appears \"interminable,\" he is also strangely like Jakob. For he is the one who implicitly also issues the mandate, to his daughter Gilberte: _remember your Jewish father_. A mandate like his is a variant, to be sure, of what Yerushalmi has called the \"injunction to remember\"―regarded \"\\[o\\]nly in Israel and nowhere else . . . as a religious imperative to an entire people.\" Does Gilberte fulfill the mandate? Does she carry out an act of \"deferred obedience\"? Does she make her own confession? The answer to all these questions must be yes: subversively. Gilberte profanes the memory of the Jewish father, much as Freud profanes sacred Jewish history, in subversive obedience to a mandate to acknowledge and engage Jewish origins. Perhaps like Freud, she also makes a confession, which has not survived, though its traces abound, in the archives.\n\n### Beyond the Purim Shpil\n\nKathryn Hellerstein\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Hellerstein2a.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/beyond-purim-shpil?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Hellerstein1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/beyond-purim-shpil?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Hellerstein170.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/beyond-purim-shpil?item=2)\n\nThe title page of a prayer in verse by a woman poet, Toybe Pan, published in Prague in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century, this long poem is entitled, '_Eyn sheyn lid naye gimakht/ beloshn tkhine iz vardin oys gitrakht' (A Brand-New Beautiful Song/ Composed in the Tkhine-Tongue)_. Unlike most _tkhines_―supplicatory Yiddish prayers for women to say individually―Toybe Pan's poem seems to have been intended for public recitation, by men as well as women, at a particular moment of communal crisis. Asking God to rescue the Jews of Prague from a plague afflicting their region, Toybe Pan subtly likens herself to Queen Esther, who rescued the Jews of Persia.\n\nTitle page and concluding page of a 1917 Yiddish poem by Moyshe Broderzon, _Sikhes Khulin_ (Small Talk), illustrated by Eliezar Lissitzky. This work, which parodies a medieval chronicle of the Jewish community of Prague , was an early attempt to formulate a modern Jewish idea of art. Physically, _Sikhes Khulin_ resembles a Scroll of Esther, read by Jews on Purim, in that Broderzon's text was inscribed by hand, as by a _sofer_ (Jewish scribe), and a few hand-colored copies of the small edition were presented in the form of a scroll. By presenting a modern Yiddish verse parody of a medieval Jewish chronicle in the physical form of an ancient Hebrew sacred text, Broderzon and Lissitzky reconfigure the sacred as secular and the traditional as modern in order to tell a new Jewish story.\n\nThis is the only extant photograph of the Lodz Yiddish poet, Miriam Ulinover (Lodz 1890-Auschwitz, 1944), whose 1922 poem, 'Ester hamalke' (Esther the Queen) casts a shtetl maiden in the role of Esther at a synagogue Purim celebration. In Ulinover's deliberately old-fashioned, folk-like diction and verse form, the girl saves herself from a modern alienation and, through the fantasy of herself as the ancient, heroic queen, contrasts the folk culture of a shtetl grandmother with the urbane literary culture of Ulinover's readers.\n\nESTHER THE QUEEN\n\n(Warsaw, 1922)\n\nWhen the gregger knocks and rattles,   \nYou can hardly hear a word―   \nI won't allow you people   \nTo chase away my dream!\n\nMy skirt, plain calico,   \nSwaying to and fro―   \nTurns into actual   \nCrimson frill and bow.\n\nThe thin red ribbon   \nLooped around my braid   \nWill with royal scarlet   \nCrown my head. \n\nSomehow, my face grows   \nCharming and dark…   \nLike Esther the Queen!―   \nA still smile in my heart.\n\nAnd I blossom forth in beauty,   \nAnd my dream's on fire―   \nI am the queen, the queen!   \nAnd, to raise me higher,\n\nNow the king bequests   \nHalf the kingdom's land―   \nI am Queen Esther   \nBeneath the purple band.\n\nTranslation © 2005 Kathryn Hellerstein  \nAll Rights Reserved\n\nESTER HAMALKA\n\n### Khad gadye le-El\n\nArnold J.

Only 75 copies were published in the Soviet Union in 1919 and most have been lost since then. This magnificent collection of this Russian Jewish artist's graphic interpretations of each verse of the well-known song found at the end of the traditional Passover Haggadah is a significant, moving and enigmatic testimony of the beginning the end of Jewish culture in the Soviet Union. The artist produced this series of whimsical illustrations in a modernistic style leading up to a statement of support of the Revolution in the last frame, but the reader cannot escape the hidden suggestion conveyed by the Yiddish usage of the term \"Khad gadye\" meaning \"jail.\" After this series of illustrations, Lissitzky never again signed his work with his full Jewish name, Eliezer, but truncated it to El Lissitzky.\n\n### V. Laykhter's Orthodox Expressionist Poetry\n\nBeatrice Lang Caplan\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/bCaplan170.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/v-laykhters-orthodox-expressionist-poetry?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/bCaplan00.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/v-laykhters-orthodox-expressionist-poetry?item=1)\n\nIn the early 1920s, the religious poet V. Laykhter published a number of Yiddish poems in a style best described as Orthodox expressionism. The image displayed below is part of one of these poems (click on the image for full text and translation).\n\nLaykhter (pseudonym of Meyer Voydislavski) was born in 1904 into a well-to-do Hasidic family in Lodz , Poland . He spent the years of the First World War in Russia , and it is likely that he encountered avant-garde poetics there. When he returned to Lodz after the war, he became active in the Orthodox political party Agudes Yisroel, helping to found its youth wing, then known as \"Tseirey Emuney Yisroel\" (\"The Youth of the Faithful of Israel\"). He also founded an Orthodox publishing house, Sgule, and an Orthodox Yiddish journal _Ortodoksishe bletlekh_ (_Orthodox Pages_), that he edited himself and that appeared between 1922 and 1924. In 1925 he immigrated to Palestine where he continued to write both in Hebrew and in Yiddish for the Orthodox press both in Palestine and in Poland . He died in Tel Aviv in 1945 of a heart attack.\n\nIt is important to note that these activities were novel, even revolutionary, in the Orthodox sphere in Poland in the early years of the interwar period. Laykhter was involved in the formation of the institutions of organized Orthodoxy in Poland in a period in which new norms for a traditional way of life in the modern world were being set, and the parameters of an Orthodox lifestyle still very fluid. With his unique Orthodox expressionism, however, Laykhter pushed what was acceptable within Orthodox circles to the limit. At the root of expressionism, the dominant style in (secular) Yiddish poetry at the time, was Nietzsche's pronouncement that \"God is dead\" and the perception that the world was in a state of collapse. This stance is clearly antithetical to a religious world view, and yet Laykhter managed to convey the feeling of chaos and collapse that came to head in the First World War within a framework of faith.\n\nThe poem reproduced here, \"Dos geshrey fun a stam in lerkayt fun velt\" (\"Someone's Cry in the Emptiness of World\"), most clearly illustrates how Laykhter was able to use the expressionist aesthetic while at the same time asserting belief in God. The last few lines create a framework of faith, a simple faith in one God no matter what, that frees the poet to explore his relationship with a violent, fragmented world without the denial of God that the aesthetic implies. The poem does not, however, lend itself to a simple interpretation. Although the speaker clearly states his faith, the tension between the tormented bulk of the poem and its pious ending suggests that this faith has been shaken, and that it is only through an act of intellectual abstraction (\"alef=one― / one God in the world\") that the overwhelming sense of despair can be held in check.\n\nAntologye fun religyeze lider un dertseylungen : shafungen fun shrayber, umgekumene in di yorn fun Yidishn hurbn in Eyrope / tsuzamengeshtelt fun Mosheh Prager.

He was a leading Russian Revolutionary fiction writer, and made no effort to suppress his Jewish background in his prose. As a child growing up in a middle class Odessa Jewish family, Babel would have heard Yiddish spoken, and spoke the language well enough himself to edit two volumes of Sholem-Aleykhem's stories in Russian, and to translate a Yiddish story, 'Dzhiro-Dzhiro,' by the fiction writer Dovid Bergelson. In his early years as a writer Babel experimented with topics of Jewish concern. His first story, 'Staryi Shloime,' written just after the Beiliss case in 1913, engages the Jewish encounter with anti-Semitism though the eyes of a tragic elderly Jew who kills himself when his children, faced with a Tsarist edict for the eviction of Jews from their homes, are baptized. His 1918 'Shabbos Nakhamu,' which was part of an unfinished cycle about a folk hero of Jewish lore, the wise trickster Hershele of Ostropol, shows that he is fascinated with the kinds of cultural prototypes appearing in the Yiddish literature of his time. After moving to St. Petersburg in 1916, Babel met the editor and writer who could make or break the career of young literateurs, Maksim Gorky, who published two of the young writer's stories in his journal _Letopis_, as well as hiring him as a correspondent for the newspaper _Novaia zhizn'_ in 1918. Gorky was surrounded by his own aura and mythology – he was raised in poverty, had struggled for an education – his works were truly read _en masse_ in Revolutionary Russia, particularly among Jews. (In fact, Sholem-Aleykhem and Gorky were good friends.) This connection to Gorky would help Babel to make a name for himself in 1923 when he began publishing his _Red Cavalry_ stories in the avant-garde _Lef_ and the fellow traveler journal _Krasnaia Nov'_.\n\n### Silent Wigwams\n\nAlan Mintz\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Mintz0-289.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/silent-wigwams?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Mintz270.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/silent-wigwams?item=1)\n\n'Silent Wigwams' is a long narrative Hebrew poem published in 1933 about American Indian life by Israel Efros, who was born in Ostrog, Poland in 1891, came to America in 1905, emigrated to Israel in 1954, where he died in 1981. The poem is set in the early eighteenth century around Chesapeake Bay and deals with the love affair between the daughter of an Indian tribal chief and an English artist who has been driven out of the white settler community. Efros's poem is one of several epic poetic compositions written by American Hebrew poets in the first half of the twentieth century. They belong to a larger cultural project of American Hebraism, which sought to establish an elite Hebraic culture among the leadership of American Jewry.\n\nWriting about the Indians was the expression of a desire on the part of American Hebraists to contribute images and knowledge from the New World to the repertoire of the revival of world Hebrew literature. The figure of the American Indian embodied a primal connection to an American landscape unpolluted by urban culture, and the tragic fate of this group―the victimization of nobility and innocence―resonated with Hebrew writers as Jews and as members of a dying breed within American Jewry.\n\n### Dvora Baron\n\nSheila Jelen\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Jelen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nDvora Baron (1887-1956) was the only woman fiction writer to have her work canonized in the literature of the Modern Hebrew Renaissance (1881-1920). Born into a rabbinic family in Ouzda, a small town outside of Minsk, Baron's first Hebrew stories were published in April 1902 when she was fifteen years old. After immigrating to Palestine in December 1910, Baron was appointed the literary editor of the important labor Zionist organ, _ha-Poel ha-Tsair_ (The Young Laborer) newspaper, and married its founder and chief editor - Yosef Aharonovich. In 1923, Baron and Aharanovich both resigned from their positions at the newspaper, and Baron began a prolonged period of isolation in her apartment (thirty three years) until her death in 1956.\n\nBaron's stories frequently deal with gender roles and class structure in traditional and newly modernizing Jewish communities both in Europe and in Palestine. Although she spent most of her literary career in Palestine, Baron did not ascribe to the Zionist 'imperative' of writing about life on the new Yishuv and 'negating,' in her stories, the experience of Jewish life in the Diaspora. Indeed, even Baron's stories set in Palestine tend to thematize the profound continuities that exist between traditional Jewish experience and modern Jewish experience, between life lived within a modern nationalist milieu and life lived according to the rhythms of religious faith and the struggle for daily survival.\n\n### Good Night, World\n\nAnita Norich\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Norich.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nOn or about April 1938, Yiddish culture changed. The journal In Zikh \\[In the Self\\] opened its April 1938 issue with a poem by Yankev Glatshteyn, one of its founding figures. Entitled \"A gute nakht, velt\" \\[Good Night, World\\], the poem quickly became a touchstone for Yiddish intellectuals in America faced with increasingly frightening news from Europe and seeking new ways in which to understand their own relationship to modernity. Glatshteyn (1896-1971) was one of the leading ideologues and poets of the inzikhist (introspectivist) movement which, in 1919, had proclaimed a new poetic day in Yiddish. \"The world exists and we are a part of it,\" the first issue of the journal In Zikh announced. \"But for us, the world exists only as it is mirrored in us, as it touches _us_.\"  There were no inappropriate subjects for poetry, as Glatshteyn declared, since Introspectivists 'do not know of any boundaries between themselves and the world, between feeling and thought. They recognize no taboo on the national or the social;' their subject was 'the wide world as it is reflected in the poet.'  'Good Night, World' asked whether the modern Jew could still count on the promises of the Enlightenment―that the Jews and even Yiddish could live in, be nourished by, produce world cultures, that they could live as citizens of their countries of residence, that \"liberty, equality, and fraternity\" applied to them too. The poem primarily reveals the tension of Yiddish writers like Glatshteyn, who felt themselves betrayed by the modern world yet were unable to reject it.\n\n### Else Lasker-Schueler\n\nAnita Shapira\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Shapira.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe portrait of the poetess Else Lasker-Schueler, made by Kaete Efraim Markus, tells a story within a story: tossed by fate and choice to the shores of the Mediterranean, Lasker-Shueler, who lived the latter years of her life in loneliness and misery in Jerusalem, is having her portrait made by a another Jewish German woman refugee, who found asylum in Palestine, but hardly her cultural home. The ambiguity of living in the Land of Israel, while feeling in exile, is portrayed in this picture by the mask Schueler wears, and by the image reflected in the mirror: nothing is as it seems, all images are just reflections of a bygone reality, conveyed by the elegant fur collar of Schueler's dress, so out of tune with Palestinian climate and the informality of dress and behavior of the emerging Jewish society there. The estrangement of exiles encapsulates Jewish fates in the 20th Century.\n\n### Satiric Utopist\n\nGidon Nevo\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Nevo200.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/satiric-utopist?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Nevo3-200.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/satiric-utopist?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Nevo5.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/satiric-utopist?item=2)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Nevo7.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/satiric-utopist?item=3)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Nevo6.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/satiric-utopist?item=4)\n\nEphraim Kishon, who passed away earlier this year (2005) at the age of 81, was one of the most important Israeli satirists during the early decades of the state if not _the_ most important one. Despite the wide popularity that he enjoyed as a writer, dramatist and film maker, his large body of work was never systematically studied, and has never been the focus of close academic attention.\n\nWhile seemingly light and good humored, the satire of Kishon, in its diversity, in its activity as a cognitive and ideological tool uncovers a multitude of deep-seated problems which accumulate to form a critical mass ultimately threatening, even endangering the very existence of the satirist's society.\n\nKishon's utopia of an economically efficient, ultra-liberal bourgeois society – the utopia serving as the basis from which the satirical attacks were being planned and executed – was at odds with the socialist norms holding sway in Israel at the time of writing. But as history would have it, this utopia, or the ideology from which it stems, is now devoutly adhered to by the dominant powers in Israeli politics. Within Hebrew belle-lettres, Kishon's work – comic, ironic, versatile – can be considered as the blue-print of this ideology, the most eloquent, thorough and (certainly) the most entertaining we have.\n\n### Yehuda Amichai - Ludwig Pfeuffer (1924-2000) from Wuerzburg to Jerusalem\n\nNili Gold\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Gold170.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/yehuda-amichai-ludwig-pfeuffer-1924-2000?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Gold1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/yehuda-amichai-ludwig-pfeuffer-1924-2000?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Gold3.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/yehuda-amichai-ludwig-pfeuffer-1924-2000?item=2)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Gold2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/yehuda-amichai-ludwig-pfeuffer-1924-2000?item=3)\n\nThe Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai (1924-2000), recipient of the Israel Prize and a Nobel Prize candidate, is regarded as the unofficial 'national poet' of the State of Israel. His poetry has been translated into thirty-seven languages. Though he came of age with the State of Israel, Ludwig Pfeuffer, was born in the ancient city of Wuerzburg, Germany. His German-rooted Jewish Orthodox family emigrated to British Mandatory Palestine in the 1930s.\n\nThe role Pfeuffer's childhood in Germany played in the formation of his exclusively Hebrew literary corpus is an unstudied area in the field of Amichai scholarship. Amichai's concealment of the German sources of his poetry was so successful that only a concentrated scholarly effort may unearth them. However, the Hebrew Israeli verse cannot undo the Germanic foundations of the national Israeli poet's remarkable career.\n\nAll of Amichai's writing is suffused with materials drawn from the German world he left behind. These are the early sources that nurtured him in his formative years, the forces behind his work. The architectural and artistic faces of his birthplace; its music and songs; the textbooks in grade-school and the poems he had to memorize; the sounds of church-bells and the path he walked to school, all exist on the ocean-bed of his work.\n\n### Un-American Jewishness on the Hollywood Screen\n\nStuart Schoffman\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Schoffman6-170.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/un-american-jewishness-hollywood-screen?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Schoffmanx170.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/un-american-jewishness-hollywood-screen?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Schoffman5.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/un-american-jewishness-hollywood-screen?item=2)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Schoffman4.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/un-american-jewishness-hollywood-screen?item=3)\n\nWith the advent of talking pictures in the late 1920s, Hollywood producers recruited New York playwrights to write for the movies. The great majority of producers and writers were Jewish, and the first talkie, 'The Jazz Singer,' famously tells of a cantor's son who chooses show business over the synagogue. But within a few years, overtly Jewish content and characters faded from the screen, as assimilationist movie moguls became anxious about anti-Semitism in America and abroad and were wary of jeopardizing the market appeal of their product. Thus when John Howard Lawson was hired to adapt his dark, anti-capitalist play 'Success Story' into a film (released as 'Success at Any Price' in 1934), producer Pandro Berman required him to strip it of its strong Jewish elements, and its two main characters, Sarah Glassman and Sol Ginsburg, became Sarah Griswold and Joe Martin.\n\n'I always knew that my play would be cheapened in a film version,' Lawson recalled many years later, 'but the rejection of the Jewish theme meant the rejection of everything that gave it passion and life . . . \\[W\\]ithout it there would be nothing to distinguish it from other melodramas of sex and money.'\n\nLawson was born in New York City in 1894; his father, Simeon Levy, had Anglicized the family name. Lawson was, in his words, 'amazingly unconcerned about Jewishness' before entering Williams College in 1910, but was stung when prevented from joining the college newspaper because he was a Jew. For Lawson, Jewishness translated into radical politics. He was the leading communist in Hollywood in the 1930s, and the founding president of the Screen Writers Guild. In Lawson's World War II movie **_Sahara_** (1943), directed by Zoltan Korda and starring Humphrey Bogart, an American tank is lost in the Libyan desert. Biblical allusions abound as the crew searches for water, hoping for a miracle. No Jewish characters are portrayed in the film, but there are clear hints of 'ethnic substitution' in Lawson's screenplay. A black Sudanese Muslim and a Texan G.I. nicknamed 'Waco' eke water from an underground rock in a scene signifying interracial brotherhood. An Italian prisoner of war, refusing to conspire with a Nazi also held captive by the tank crew, denounces Hitler in a speech evocative of Shakespeare's Shylock:\n\n> 'But are my eyes blind that I must fall to my knees to worship a maniac who has made of my country a concentration camp, who has made of my people slaves? Must I kiss the hand that beats me, lick the boot that kicks me, no! I rather spend my whole life living in this dirty hole than escape to fight again for things I do not believe against people I do not hate. As for your Hitler, it's because of a man like him that God – my God – created hell!'\n\nAs a member of the 'Hollywood Ten,' Lawson defied the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), accusing them of wanting to 'muzzle the great Voice of democracy . . . \\[and\\] attack Negroes, Jews, and other minorities.' He served nine months in Federal prison in 1950-51 for contempt of Congress. Blacklisted thereafter, he adapted 'Cry the Beloved Country,' also directed by Korda, for the screen, but novelist Alan Paton received sole credit. Lawson died in 1977.\n\n### Nefertiti's Granddaughter\n\nDeborah A.

Born to a Karaite family in Cairo in 1930, Maurice Shammas was raised in _harat al-yahud_, the old Jewish quarter, and educated in Egyptian schools. Prior to his departure from Egypt in 1951, Shammas had worked as a journalist, and was involved in Egyptian theater. In Israel, Shammas has made a career working for the Arabic language section of the Israeli Radio and Television Broadcasting authority. He has also published three volumes of written work in Arabic, including the book depicted here as well a collection of short stories _Al-_ s\\_haykh shabtay wa-hikayat min harat al-yahud\\_ \\[ Sheik Shabbtai and Stories from _Harat al-Yahud_\\] (1979), and a slim volume of poetry _Sab'a sanabil hazila_\\[ Seven Lean Sheaves\\] (1989). Shammas's work stands out in the field of Egyptian Jewish nostalgia literature by providing a unique perspective on the richness of Arabic cultural integration in Egypt and by offering views of oft-forgotten spaces of the city, particularly _harat al-yahud_.\n\n### Contemporary Jewish Writing in Britain and Ireland\n\nBryan Cheyette\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Cheyette.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nAs Jewish writers are thought not to exist in Britain, the common reaction to this anthology of contemporary Jewish writings in Britain and Ireland has been, for the most part, one of incredulity. It is a literary canon that falls between two stools and thus is deemed not to exist. The English Literature academic establishment, on the one hand, has long since subsumed writers from most of the globe-- especially from America, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales-- into the canon of \"English\" letters. Recent literary histories of modern English literature simply ignore British-Jewish writers or treat them as if they were not part of the culture as a whole. No wonder that British-Jewish writers have been either smothered at birth or, more usually, been simply left out in the cold. Judaic literary scholars, on the other hand, have tended to assume that the American-Jewish diaspora is synonymous with the Jewish diaspora tout court and that Anglo therefore equals American (to quote George Bernard Shaw: 'Americans and Britons are divided by a common language'). From the narrow perspective of exile and national rebirth, European writers are divided retrospectively into those who published before and after the Holocaust, with Britain occupying a strangely untouched space on the sidelines. Bemused students are often surprised to discover that authors such as Harold Pinter, Anita Brookner and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala can also be read Jewishly. Still, it is worth making a virtue of this marginality as British-Jewish writers have turned their very sense of marginality into lasting drama, poetry and fiction. The inbetweenness of modern British-Jewish writers has led to an extraordinary growth in the inventiveness and originality of this literature since the 1980s and this is beginning to be recognized generally.\n\n### Oppositional Culture and American Jewish Literature\n\nLaurence Roth\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/RothPlotz170.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/oppositional-culture-and-american-jewish?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/rothHeeb.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/oppositional-culture-and-american-jewish?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/rothLostTribe.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/oppositional-culture-and-american-jewish?item=2)\n\nHere are three examples illustrating the infiltration of oppositional culture into American Jewish _belles lettres_ and literature. Whether termed 'alterna-Jews' or 'New Jews,' exponents of a Jewish oppositional culture, or of 'radical Jewish culture' (a phrase borrowed from John Zorn and his circle of klezmer experimentalists), aim to subvert or recontextualize the tired narratives, stale images, and fey sounds dogging American Jewish culture and religiosity.\n\nThe covers of _Plotz: The Zine for the Vaclempt, Heeb: The New Jew Review,_ and _Lost Tribe: Jewish Fiction from the Edge_ illustrate the look of such a Jewish oppositional culture as well as a contemporary anxiety not only about the tenacity of negative Jewish images, but also about the meaning of Jewishness in an American context: Is Jewishness just a _shtick_, just some funny act in American popular and mass culture, or is it something more relevant and durable?\n\nPlotz , which ran from 1995 to 2002, was a zine based in New York City and produced by Barbara Rushkoff, née Kligman. A zine, short for 'fanzine' or 'fan magazine,' is an amateur literary production―independently produced and distributed, usually photocopied or offset printed―that reflects a sub-cultural (or at least one person's idiosyncratic) take on popular phenomena and obsessions. Rushkoff yoked zine writing practices and attitudes with Jewish humor and thereby repositioned Jewishness in her zine as another type of oppositional culture within zine subcultures of the 1990s. _Plotz's_ cultural significance is that it evidences how the discourse of a Jewish oppositional culture originated, in part, in the American zine scene.\n\nIssue number ten (1998) took aim at popular images of the Jewish woman. Its front cover is a clip-art image of a Black woman with an afro whose eyes have been replaced by Jewish stars. Through such graphic subversions Rushkoff linked, in a provocative way, the experience of Black and Jewish women, underscoring how popular images of feminine beauty marginalize Black and Jewish women's physical and cultural differences. _Plotz_ consistently sprung critiques of white, middle-class femininity, and consistently 'talked back' to negative, condescending, or idealized popular images of Jewish women through such manipulations of clip-art images.\n\n_Heeb: The New Jew Review_ is a bridge between the zine scene and commercial American Jewish literature. Its founding editor, Jennifer Bleyer, was a zine writer in the Ohio indie punk scene and the publisher of _Mazel-Tov Cocktail_, a one-issue New York zine. _Heeb_ complicates our understanding of what happens when capital and cultures of opposition collide. For while _Heeb_ may provide a kind of voyeuristic access to a consumption-based identity―the 'New Jew' brand―it also enables a young and skeptical readership, one committed to democratizing American Jewish cultural literacy, to situate itself within the wider currents of American society and culture.\n\nIssue number three, 'Up, Up, and Oy Vey' (Spring 2003), uses a visual stereotype of the Hasidic Jew―black hat, exaggerated _payess_, silk _kapote_―as a vehicle for both laughing at _and_ reclaiming the Jewish origins of Superman. Such a 'Superjew' reflects Jewish pride even as it pokes fun, in the same manner as _Plotz_, at a popular image of male strength ostensibly at odds with Jewish men's physical and cultural differences.\n\nPaul Zakrzewski's _Lost Tribe: Jewish Fiction from the Edge_, an anthology of new Jewish fiction published in 2003, illustrates how oppositional culture has been incorporated into the packaging of American Jewish literature. The visual vocabulary of the cover incorporates two figures that evoke yet another stereotypical popular image of Jewish men, one signified by the white kippot and Jewfros. The graffiti title, _Lost Tribe_, emphasizes not only a 'tagging,' a naming, but also an absence that is underscored by the faceless figures sitting underneath the title. Zakrzewski's book visually evokes _Plotz_ and _Heeb_ (Zakrzewski was the original features editor of _Heeb_); all three publications use similar kinds of images to advertise themselves as narratives about lost identities, ones occluded by the stereotypes and clichés of popular culture.\n\nThus the discourse of a Jewish oppositional culture, cribbed wittingly and unwittingly from zines, has become an important component in the refiguring and marketing of contemporary American Jewishness and the literature that explores and conveys it.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Arendt, Hannah.** _Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess.,_ Edited by Liliane Weissberg; Translated by Richard and Clara Winston (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997)\n    \n*   **Band, Arnold J.** _Studies in Modern Jewish Literature_.

On the one hand, there are literatures in Jewish languages, principally Hebrew, Yiddish and Ladino. On the other, there are Jewish literatures in Russian, German, French, Arabic, English and many other vernacular languages. American Jewish literature, while belonging to the latter category, seems to delimit a sphere of its own reflecting, especially in recent decades, the “difference” of American Jewry. We examined with great interest how in each of these cases the choice of the linguistic medium determines the intended audience and in turn affects the message about Jewish identity and culture. In all instances, we saw literature as a site of intense struggle around the question of Jewishness and modernity in which all the resources of the linguistic imagination were called into play to negotiate the passage from traditional society to contemporary life. What, then, is Jewish literature? Is it one or many? Are there viable criteria for determining what lies within and without the bounds of Jewish literature? These questions, perhaps in the end unanswerable, do not cease to engage us.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Alan Mintz\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"i-did-not-interview-the-dead\">I Did Not Interview the Dead\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Alan Rosen\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Rosen%20%281%29.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>David Boder’s \u003Cem>I Did Not Interview the Dead\u003C/em> (U of Illinois Press, 1949) contains eight interviews with displaced persons. A Latvian Jewish émigré to America, Boder traveled to Europe in 1946 to carry out 109 interviews of Holocaust victims—interviews that he conducted in seven languages. Seventy English transcriptions totaling some 3100 pages were eventually brought out by Boder. \u003Cem>I Did Not Interview the Dead\u003C/em> offered a sample of the massive project. The book jacket displayed here won a graphic arts award for its haunting design.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The interplay between Jewish and non-Jewish languages forms a crucial dimension of Boder’s Eastern European origins, education and training; his academic focus on the relation between language and trauma; his aspiration to found a new genre of world literature that he defined, nevertheless, under the rubric of Torah; the complex evolution of the multilingual interviews into a monolingual text; and the puzzling reception of his work, which has relegated the issues of language to the periphery. Boder’s focus on language, multilingualism and Jewish notions of tradition and textuality form a key to his approach to Holocaust testimony.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"schmerz-der-liebe-pain-of-love\">\u003Cem>Schmerz der Liebe (Pain of Love)\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Liliane Weissberg\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Weissberg170.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Weissberg1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Rebecca Salomon was born 1783, the daughter of one of the most prominent Jewish bankers and businessmen in Berlin. She married the son of David Friedlaender, one of the leaders of the Jewish community in Berlin, but divorced him after a brief marriage, and began to write and publish popular novels under a pen name, Regina Frohberg. She later took this name as her legal one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Frohberg, who lived in Berlin and later Vienna, can be considered the first German-Jewish novelist. Most of her fiction deals with the aristocratic milieu, and offers love stories with complicated plot lines; they can be compared to generic Romance novels of today. But some of the plots—as that of the present book, \u003Cem>Schmerz der Liebe\u003C/em> (Pain of Love)—offered an additional interest for readers in the know. \u003Cem>Schmerz der Liebe\u003C/em> translated gossip relating to members of the Jewish community into the aristocratic sphere. Thus, Frohberg’s work provides an interesting insight into Jewish life around 1800, and her project of assimilation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"rewriting-rebecca\">Rewriting Rebecca\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Maurice Samuels\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/samuels.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Nineteenth-century historical novels―such as Walter Scott’s \u003Cem>Ivanhoe\u003C/em> (1818), in which the beautiful Rebecca is carried off against her will by a Templar Knight―often depict the foundation of the modern nation state through the persecution of an exoticized Jewess. But what happens when a nineteenth-century Jewish woman writer takes up the genre of historical fiction? Eugénie Foa, née Esther-Rebecca-Eugénie Rodgrigues-Henriques (1796-1853), from a prominent Sephardic family of Bordeaux, wrote a series of historical fictions in the 1830s and 40s from the perspective of Jewish women who struggle to find a place between tradition and modernity, between religious and national identity. The first Jew to write fiction in French, Foa exploited her difference to claim a unique place in the literary field of nineteenth-century France. The popular genre of the historical novel provided her with a means of furthering both her political/ideological agenda―to promote Jewish assimilation in France―and her personal/professional one―to live, against all odds, by her pen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"grace-aguilars-vale-of-cedars\">Grace Aguilar’s \u003Cem>Vale of Cedars\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Nadia Valman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Valman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Valman1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>The Vale of Cedars; or, The Martyr\u003C/em>, by the Anglo-Jewish novelist and poet Grace Aguilar and published posthumously in 1850, was the first popular English novel on a Jewish historical theme. Written when the author was still in her late teens, the novel displays Aguilar’s astute manipulation of the genre of historical romance to serve the cause of Anglo-Jewish religious pride and political emancipation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Aguilar’s novel, set in Inquisition Spain, was designed to appeal to readers of Sir Walter Scott’s hugely successful tale of medieval England, \u003Cem>Ivanhoe\u003C/em> (1819), in focusing on the plight of a beautiful young Jewish woman struggling with her desire for a gentile knight and enduring persecution for resisting conversion to Christianity. \u003Cem>The Vale of Cedars\u003C/em>, alongside Aguilar’s other fictional and devotional writings, was intended to counter the literary efforts of Evangelical conversionists who frequently represented the Jewess as particularly amenable – and susceptible - to conversion. Aguilar’s heroine, in contrast, is a crypto-Jewess who passes as a Catholic courtier while remaining loyal to her own religion. Instead of desiring conversion to Christianity, she longs to be liberated from her life of disguise and to embrace Judaism publicly. She was a metaphor for Anglo-Jews who, in early Victorian England, had to choose between religion and citizenship.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yet in her writing, Aguilar did not so much depart from the model of Evangelical literature as draw upon it. In particular, she utilised a key trope of Evangelical fiction for women: their reverence for femininity, female companionship, and female moral force. In \u003Cem>The Vale of Cedars\u003C/em>, the heroine, pursued and tortured by the Inquisition, is (with implausible poetic license) protected by the maternal figure of Queen Isabella. The Queen reproaches her courtiers for their disapproval of her compassion for Marie: ‘Has every spark of woman’s nature faded from your hearts, that ye can speak thus? … Detest, abhor, avoid her faith - for that we command thee; but her sex, her sorrow, have a claim to sympathy and aid, which not even her race can remove’. In Aguilar’s fiction, differences of ‘faith’ or ‘race’ could be transcended by the universalist ideology of femininity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"pax-vobiscum\">Pax Vobiscum\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Marc Caplan\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/pax-vobiscum?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/mCaplan.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/pax-vobiscum?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/mCaplan1-170.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>More than a pen-name, Sholem Aleichem is the alter-ego, or literary persona, of Sholem Rabinovitsh (1859-1916), who through this creation has become known as the greatest Yiddish writer, and the most outstanding humorist in modern Jewish literature. The name “Sholem Aleichem” itself means, alternately, “Peace Be Unto You” or “How d’you do” it’s a greeting offered in Yiddish, and Hebrew, to a familiar person with whom one is nonetheless not in constant contact. “Sholem Aleichem” is not a daily greeting, like “hello” or “good afternoon,” but rather the greeting offered to a person one hasn’t seen in several days. As a pseudonym or alternate identity, it thus suggests familiarity and distance at one and the same time, and this combination is essential to Sholem Aleichem’s enduring popularity, as well as his deceptively satirical comic vision.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Among his many achievements, Sholem Aleichem must rank among the most prolific figures in modern Jewish literature; the standard edition of his “complete” works runs to 28 volumes, and even this collection is marred by several glaring omissions. His most famous and critically regarded narratives include \u003Cem>Tevye the Milkman\u003C/em>, \u003Cem>The\u003C/em> \u003Cem>Letters of Menakhem-Mendl and Sheyne-Sheyndl\u003C/em>, \u003Cem>Motl the Cantor Peyse’s Son\u003C/em>, and the \u003Cem>Railroad Stories\u003C/em>. Although Sholem Aleichem began his career with the aspiration of creating for Yiddish literature something analogous to Honoré de Balzac’s Comédie humaine—a grand cycle of realist novels portraying a civilization in its entirety—the works on which his reputation rests are in fact sequences of monologues (or in the case of the Menakhem-Mendl sequence, letters that read like monologues) narrated typically by marginal figures with an incomplete understanding of their situation. Their literary quality derives from the author’s mastery of a super-idiomatic Yiddish that sounds like everyday speech, but evokes tragicomic echoes of traditional Jewish learning, juxtaposed against the fragmentation and confusion of Jewish Eastern Europe in the midst of industrial modernization, political instability, and mass emigration.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In addition to the best known and most canonical of Sholem Aleichem’s tale sequences, another series of stories meriting reappraisal is the group of satirical tales he wrote describing the general character of life in the fictional shtetl Kasrilevke. Although most contemporary critics have focused their attention to Sholem Aleichem on the most explicitly dynamic narratives in his body of work, the Kasrilevke stories reiterate exhaustively—and to considerable comic effect—the essentially static, immobile aspects of traditional Jewish life. When taken as a particular genre, the Kasrilevke stories evoke not only a location, but an inverted presence, a revocation of the dynamism that characterizes Jewish modernity and Sholem Aleichem’s (or rather, Rabinovitsh’s) political convictions. The Kasrilevke sequence therefore presents a rejoinder to the ideological ferment of early-20th century Eastern European life. How Sholem Aleichem conceptualizes this space is a crucial issue because precisely the control of space, territory, is the central preoccupation of all the modern ideologies to which the Kasrilevke stories obliquely and subversively respond.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-melting-pot\">The Melting Pot\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Michael P.

In this \u003Cem>Puck\u003C/em> cartoon of 1889, ‘The Mortar of Assimilation ― and the One Element that Won’t Mix, Lady Liberty stirs the tub of citizenship, and a recalicitrant Irish revolutionary dances on the rim.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But it was Zangwill’s play that made the melting pot the central term in the discourse of immigration and assimilation. Lauded by President Theodore Roosevelt and denounced by countless American rabbis, \u003Cem>The Melting Pot\u003C/em> dramatizes the ideal of Americanzation in the love-conquers-all story of David Quixano, a young Russian Jewish musician whose family was killed in the Kishinev pogrom, and Vera Revendal, a beautiful Russian Christian whose father masterminded the massacre. Ironically, the one element that doesn’t mix in the play is not an immigrant but Quincy Davenport, a descendant of the Puritan founders and David’s mirror opposite, whose decadence and immorality make him unfit to inherit his ancestors’ legacy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"à-la-recherche-du-juif-perdu\">À la recherche du juif perdu\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Scott Lerner\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Lerner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Lerner2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yosef Yerushalmi tells the story of his discovery, in the Sigmund Freud Archives in Washington DC, of the family Bible that Freud’s father Jakob first inscribed, in Hebrew, on the occasion of Sigmund Freud’s circumcision. Thirty-five years later, the elder Freud had the volume re-bound in leather, and he added a dedication to his son, by hand and in Hebrew, composed as a \u003Cem>melitzah\u003C/em>―a traditional genre in Hebrew letters consisting of an arrangement of textual bits drawn from the Bible and other Jewish sources. Yerushalmi appears to believe―though he does not insist―that this dedication offers strong evidence of the Freud’s ability to read and understand Hebrew, Freud’s statements to the contrary notwithstanding. Yerushalmi calls Freud’s writing of \u003Cem>Moses and Monotheism\u003C/em> an act of “‘deferred obedience’” to a paternal “‘mandate.’” The \u003Cem>melitzah\u003C/em> written by Jakob Freud in 1896 directed Sigmund to return to the book and to reengage his Jewish origins. At a distance of thirty-eight years, the son obeyed the father by radically rewriting the history that constitutes and preserves the Jews as a people. How, we might wonder, would his father, the author of the \u003Cem>melitzah\u003C/em>, have received \u003Cem>Moses and Monotheism\u003C/em> in fulfillment of his mandate? Yerushalmi thinks that Jakob Freud “would not have been displeased.” One thing seems clear, however. If \u003Cem>Moses and Monotheism\u003C/em> may be understood as a satisfactory fulfillment of a mandate to return to Jewish history and origins, then obedience, in this context, does not preclude subversion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In Proust, remarkably, many of these same elements are present. Proust’s Charles Swann is a paradigm of assimilation, especially in the French context, where assimilation is best measured by the standard of the severest gatekeepers of \u003Cem>francité\u003C/em> (Frenchness): the high aristocracy. The vexed question of Swann’s Jewishness is definitely resolved in \u003Cem>Sodome et Gomorrhe\u003C/em> when, at the height of the Dreyfus Affair, the narrator describes him as degrading facially to the point where he resembles an “old Hebrew rather than a dilettante Valois.” Nearing death, Swann returns “to the spiritual fold of his fathers” [‘au bercail religieux de ses pères’] and arrives “at the age of the prophet.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If Swann is thus like Sigmund Freud, a Jew whose Judaism may be “terminated,” but whose Jewishness appears “interminable,” he is also strangely like Jakob. For he is the one who implicitly also issues the mandate, to his daughter Gilberte: \u003Cem>remember your Jewish father\u003C/em>. A mandate like his is a variant, to be sure, of what Yerushalmi has called the “injunction to remember”―regarded “[o]nly in Israel and nowhere else … as a religious imperative to an entire people.” Does Gilberte fulfill the mandate? Does she carry out an act of “deferred obedience”? Does she make her own confession? The answer to all these questions must be yes: subversively. Gilberte profanes the memory of the Jewish father, much as Freud profanes sacred Jewish history, in subversive obedience to a mandate to acknowledge and engage Jewish origins. Perhaps like Freud, she also makes a confession, which has not survived, though its traces abound, in the archives.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"beyond-the-purim-shpil\">Beyond the Purim Shpil\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Kathryn Hellerstein\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/beyond-purim-shpil?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Hellerstein2a.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/beyond-purim-shpil?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Hellerstein1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/beyond-purim-shpil?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Hellerstein170.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The title page of a prayer in verse by a woman poet, Toybe Pan, published in Prague in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century, this long poem is entitled, ‘\u003Cem>Eyn sheyn lid naye gimakht/ beloshn tkhine iz vardin oys gitrakht’ (A Brand-New Beautiful Song/ Composed in the Tkhine-Tongue)\u003C/em>.

In Ulinover’s deliberately old-fashioned, folk-like diction and verse form, the girl saves herself from a modern alienation and, through the fantasy of herself as the ancient, heroic queen, contrasts the folk culture of a shtetl grandmother with the urbane literary culture of Ulinover’s readers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>ESTHER THE QUEEN\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>(Warsaw, 1922)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the gregger knocks and rattles, \u003Cbr>\nYou can hardly hear a word― \u003Cbr>\nI won’t allow you people \u003Cbr>\nTo chase away my dream!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My skirt, plain calico, \u003Cbr>\nSwaying to and fro― \u003Cbr>\nTurns into actual \u003Cbr>\nCrimson frill and bow.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The thin red ribbon \u003Cbr>\nLooped around my braid \u003Cbr>\nWill with royal scarlet \u003Cbr>\nCrown my head. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Somehow, my face grows \u003Cbr>\nCharming and dark… \u003Cbr>\nLike Esther the Queen!― \u003Cbr>\nA still smile in my heart.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And I blossom forth in beauty, \u003Cbr>\nAnd my dream’s on fire― \u003Cbr>\nI am the queen, the queen! \u003Cbr>\nAnd, to raise me higher,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now the king bequests \u003Cbr>\nHalf the kingdom’s land― \u003Cbr>\nI am Queen Esther \u003Cbr>\nBeneath the purple band.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Translation © 2005 Kathryn Hellerstein\u003Cbr>\nAll Rights Reserved\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>ESTER HAMALKA\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"khad-gadye-le-el\">Khad gadye le-El\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Arnold J.

Only 75 copies were published in the Soviet Union in 1919 and most have been lost since then. This magnificent collection of this Russian Jewish artist’s graphic interpretations of each verse of the well-known song found at the end of the traditional Passover Haggadah is a significant, moving and enigmatic testimony of the beginning the end of Jewish culture in the Soviet Union. The artist produced this series of whimsical illustrations in a modernistic style leading up to a statement of support of the Revolution in the last frame, but the reader cannot escape the hidden suggestion conveyed by the Yiddish usage of the term “Khad gadye” meaning “jail.” After this series of illustrations, Lissitzky never again signed his work with his full Jewish name, Eliezer, but truncated it to El Lissitzky.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"v-laykhters-orthodox-expressionist-poetry\">V.

Laykhter published a number of Yiddish poems in a style best described as Orthodox expressionism. The image displayed below is part of one of these poems (click on the image for full text and translation).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Laykhter (pseudonym of Meyer Voydislavski) was born in 1904 into a well-to-do Hasidic family in Lodz , Poland . He spent the years of the First World War in Russia , and it is likely that he encountered avant-garde poetics there. When he returned to Lodz after the war, he became active in the Orthodox political party Agudes Yisroel, helping to found its youth wing, then known as “Tseirey Emuney Yisroel” (“The Youth of the Faithful of Israel”). He also founded an Orthodox publishing house, Sgule, and an Orthodox Yiddish journal \u003Cem>Ortodoksishe bletlekh\u003C/em> (\u003Cem>Orthodox Pages\u003C/em>), that he edited himself and that appeared between 1922 and 1924. In 1925 he immigrated to Palestine where he continued to write both in Hebrew and in Yiddish for the Orthodox press both in Palestine and in Poland . He died in Tel Aviv in 1945 of a heart attack.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It is important to note that these activities were novel, even revolutionary, in the Orthodox sphere in Poland in the early years of the interwar period. Laykhter was involved in the formation of the institutions of organized Orthodoxy in Poland in a period in which new norms for a traditional way of life in the modern world were being set, and the parameters of an Orthodox lifestyle still very fluid. With his unique Orthodox expressionism, however, Laykhter pushed what was acceptable within Orthodox circles to the limit. At the root of expressionism, the dominant style in (secular) Yiddish poetry at the time, was Nietzsche’s pronouncement that “God is dead” and the perception that the world was in a state of collapse. This stance is clearly antithetical to a religious world view, and yet Laykhter managed to convey the feeling of chaos and collapse that came to head in the First World War within a framework of faith.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The poem reproduced here, “Dos geshrey fun a stam in lerkayt fun velt” (“Someone’s Cry in the Emptiness of World”), most clearly illustrates how Laykhter was able to use the expressionist aesthetic while at the same time asserting belief in God. The last few lines create a framework of faith, a simple faith in one God no matter what, that frees the poet to explore his relationship with a violent, fragmented world without the denial of God that the aesthetic implies. The poem does not, however, lend itself to a simple interpretation. Although the speaker clearly states his faith, the tension between the tormented bulk of the poem and its pious ending suggests that this faith has been shaken, and that it is only through an act of intellectual abstraction (“alef=one― / one God in the world”) that the overwhelming sense of despair can be held in check.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Antologye fun religyeze lider un dertseylungen : shafungen fun shrayber, umgekumene in di yorn fun Yidishn hurbn in Eyrope / tsuzamengeshtelt fun Mosheh Prager.

He was a leading Russian Revolutionary fiction writer, and made no effort to suppress his Jewish background in his prose. As a child growing up in a middle class Odessa Jewish family, Babel would have heard Yiddish spoken, and spoke the language well enough himself to edit two volumes of Sholem-Aleykhem’s stories in Russian, and to translate a Yiddish story, ‘Dzhiro-Dzhiro,’ by the fiction writer Dovid Bergelson. In his early years as a writer Babel experimented with topics of Jewish concern. His first story, ‘Staryi Shloime,’ written just after the Beiliss case in 1913, engages the Jewish encounter with anti-Semitism though the eyes of a tragic elderly Jew who kills himself when his children, faced with a Tsarist edict for the eviction of Jews from their homes, are baptized. His 1918 ‘Shabbos Nakhamu,’ which was part of an unfinished cycle about a folk hero of Jewish lore, the wise trickster Hershele of Ostropol, shows that he is fascinated with the kinds of cultural prototypes appearing in the Yiddish literature of his time. After moving to St. Petersburg in 1916, Babel met the editor and writer who could make or break the career of young literateurs, Maksim Gorky, who published two of the young writer’s stories in his journal \u003Cem>Letopis\u003C/em>, as well as hiring him as a correspondent for the newspaper \u003Cem>Novaia zhizn’\u003C/em> in 1918. Gorky was surrounded by his own aura and mythology – he was raised in poverty, had struggled for an education – his works were truly read \u003Cem>en masse\u003C/em> in Revolutionary Russia, particularly among Jews. (In fact, Sholem-Aleykhem and Gorky were good friends.) This connection to Gorky would help Babel to make a name for himself in 1923 when he began publishing his \u003Cem>Red Cavalry\u003C/em> stories in the avant-garde \u003Cem>Lef\u003C/em> and the fellow traveler journal \u003Cem>Krasnaia Nov’\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"silent-wigwams\">Silent Wigwams\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Alan Mintz\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/silent-wigwams?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Mintz0-289.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/silent-wigwams?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Mintz270.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>‘Silent Wigwams’ is a long narrative Hebrew poem published in 1933 about American Indian life by Israel Efros, who was born in Ostrog, Poland in 1891, came to America in 1905, emigrated to Israel in 1954, where he died in 1981. The poem is set in the early eighteenth century around Chesapeake Bay and deals with the love affair between the daughter of an Indian tribal chief and an English artist who has been driven out of the white settler community. Efros’s poem is one of several epic poetic compositions written by American Hebrew poets in the first half of the twentieth century. They belong to a larger cultural project of American Hebraism, which sought to establish an elite Hebraic culture among the leadership of American Jewry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Writing about the Indians was the expression of a desire on the part of American Hebraists to contribute images and knowledge from the New World to the repertoire of the revival of world Hebrew literature. The figure of the American Indian embodied a primal connection to an American landscape unpolluted by urban culture, and the tragic fate of this group―the victimization of nobility and innocence―resonated with Hebrew writers as Jews and as members of a dying breed within American Jewry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"dvora-baron\">Dvora Baron\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Sheila Jelen\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Jelen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Dvora Baron (1887-1956) was the only woman fiction writer to have her work canonized in the literature of the Modern Hebrew Renaissance (1881-1920). Born into a rabbinic family in Ouzda, a small town outside of Minsk, Baron’s first Hebrew stories were published in April 1902 when she was fifteen years old. After immigrating to Palestine in December 1910, Baron was appointed the literary editor of the important labor Zionist organ, \u003Cem>ha-Poel ha-Tsair\u003C/em> (The Young Laborer) newspaper, and married its founder and chief editor - Yosef Aharonovich. In 1923, Baron and Aharanovich both resigned from their positions at the newspaper, and Baron began a prolonged period of isolation in her apartment (thirty three years) until her death in 1956.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Baron’s stories frequently deal with gender roles and class structure in traditional and newly modernizing Jewish communities both in Europe and in Palestine. Although she spent most of her literary career in Palestine, Baron did not ascribe to the Zionist ‘imperative’ of writing about life on the new Yishuv and ‘negating,’ in her stories, the experience of Jewish life in the Diaspora. Indeed, even Baron’s stories set in Palestine tend to thematize the profound continuities that exist between traditional Jewish experience and modern Jewish experience, between life lived within a modern nationalist milieu and life lived according to the rhythms of religious faith and the struggle for daily survival.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"good-night-world\">Good Night, World\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Anita Norich\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Norich.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>On or about April 1938, Yiddish culture changed. The journal In Zikh [In the Self] opened its April 1938 issue with a poem by Yankev Glatshteyn, one of its founding figures. Entitled “A gute nakht, velt” [Good Night, World], the poem quickly became a touchstone for Yiddish intellectuals in America faced with increasingly frightening news from Europe and seeking new ways in which to understand their own relationship to modernity. Glatshteyn (1896-1971) was one of the leading ideologues and poets of the inzikhist (introspectivist) movement which, in 1919, had proclaimed a new poetic day in Yiddish. “The world exists and we are a part of it,” the first issue of the journal In Zikh announced. “But for us, the world exists only as it is mirrored in us, as it touches \u003Cem>us\u003C/em>.”  There were no inappropriate subjects for poetry, as Glatshteyn declared, since Introspectivists ‘do not know of any boundaries between themselves and the world, between feeling and thought. They recognize no taboo on the national or the social;’ their subject was ‘the wide world as it is reflected in the poet.’  ‘Good Night, World’ asked whether the modern Jew could still count on the promises of the Enlightenment―that the Jews and even Yiddish could live in, be nourished by, produce world cultures, that they could live as citizens of their countries of residence, that “liberty, equality, and fraternity” applied to them too. The poem primarily reveals the tension of Yiddish writers like Glatshteyn, who felt themselves betrayed by the modern world yet were unable to reject it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"else-lasker-schueler\">Else Lasker-Schueler\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Anita Shapira\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Shapira.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The portrait of the poetess Else Lasker-Schueler, made by Kaete Efraim Markus, tells a story within a story: tossed by fate and choice to the shores of the Mediterranean, Lasker-Shueler, who lived the latter years of her life in loneliness and misery in Jerusalem, is having her portrait made by a another Jewish German woman refugee, who found asylum in Palestine, but hardly her cultural home. The ambiguity of living in the Land of Israel, while feeling in exile, is portrayed in this picture by the mask Schueler wears, and by the image reflected in the mirror: nothing is as it seems, all images are just reflections of a bygone reality, conveyed by the elegant fur collar of Schueler’s dress, so out of tune with Palestinian climate and the informality of dress and behavior of the emerging Jewish society there. The estrangement of exiles encapsulates Jewish fates in the 20th Century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"satiric-utopist\">Satiric Utopist\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Gidon Nevo\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/satiric-utopist?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Nevo200.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/satiric-utopist?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Nevo3-200.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/satiric-utopist?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Nevo5.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/satiric-utopist?item=3\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Nevo7.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/satiric-utopist?item=4\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Nevo6.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ephraim Kishon, who passed away earlier this year (2005) at the age of 81, was one of the most important Israeli satirists during the early decades of the state if not \u003Cem>the\u003C/em> most important one.

Within Hebrew belle-lettres, Kishon’s work – comic, ironic, versatile – can be considered as the blue-print of this ideology, the most eloquent, thorough and (certainly) the most entertaining we have.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"yehuda-amichai---ludwig-pfeuffer-1924-2000-from-wuerzburg-to-jerusalem\">Yehuda Amichai - Ludwig Pfeuffer (1924-2000) from Wuerzburg to Jerusalem\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Nili Gold\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/yehuda-amichai-ludwig-pfeuffer-1924-2000?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Gold170.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/yehuda-amichai-ludwig-pfeuffer-1924-2000?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Gold1.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/yehuda-amichai-ludwig-pfeuffer-1924-2000?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Gold3.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/yehuda-amichai-ludwig-pfeuffer-1924-2000?item=3\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Gold2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai (1924-2000), recipient of the Israel Prize and a Nobel Prize candidate, is regarded as the unofficial ‘national poet’ of the State of Israel. His poetry has been translated into thirty-seven languages. Though he came of age with the State of Israel, Ludwig Pfeuffer, was born in the ancient city of Wuerzburg, Germany. His German-rooted Jewish Orthodox family emigrated to British Mandatory Palestine in the 1930s.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The role Pfeuffer’s childhood in Germany played in the formation of his exclusively Hebrew literary corpus is an unstudied area in the field of Amichai scholarship. Amichai’s concealment of the German sources of his poetry was so successful that only a concentrated scholarly effort may unearth them. However, the Hebrew Israeli verse cannot undo the Germanic foundations of the national Israeli poet’s remarkable career.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All of Amichai’s writing is suffused with materials drawn from the German world he left behind. These are the early sources that nurtured him in his formative years, the forces behind his work. The architectural and artistic faces of his birthplace; its music and songs; the textbooks in grade-school and the poems he had to memorize; the sounds of church-bells and the path he walked to school, all exist on the ocean-bed of his work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"un-american-jewishness-on-the-hollywood-screen\">Un-American Jewishness on the Hollywood Screen\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Stuart Schoffman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/un-american-jewishness-hollywood-screen?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Schoffman6-170.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/un-american-jewishness-hollywood-screen?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Schoffmanx170.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/un-american-jewishness-hollywood-screen?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Schoffman5.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/un-american-jewishness-hollywood-screen?item=3\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Schoffman4.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With the advent of talking pictures in the late 1920s, Hollywood producers recruited New York playwrights to write for the movies. The great majority of producers and writers were Jewish, and the first talkie, ‘The Jazz Singer,’ famously tells of a cantor’s son who chooses show business over the synagogue. But within a few years, overtly Jewish content and characters faded from the screen, as assimilationist movie moguls became anxious about anti-Semitism in America and abroad and were wary of jeopardizing the market appeal of their product. Thus when John Howard Lawson was hired to adapt his dark, anti-capitalist play ‘Success Story’ into a film (released as ‘Success at Any Price’ in 1934), producer Pandro Berman required him to strip it of its strong Jewish elements, and its two main characters, Sarah Glassman and Sol Ginsburg, became Sarah Griswold and Joe Martin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>‘I always knew that my play would be cheapened in a film version,’ Lawson recalled many years later, ‘but the rejection of the Jewish theme meant the rejection of everything that gave it passion and life … [W]ithout it there would be nothing to distinguish it from other melodramas of sex and money.’\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lawson was born in New York City in 1894; his father, Simeon Levy, had Anglicized the family name. Lawson was, in his words, ‘amazingly unconcerned about Jewishness’ before entering Williams College in 1910, but was stung when prevented from joining the college newspaper because he was a Jew. For Lawson, Jewishness translated into radical politics. He was the leading communist in Hollywood in the 1930s, and the founding president of the Screen Writers Guild. In Lawson’s World War II movie \u003Cstrong>\u003Cem>Sahara\u003C/em>\u003C/strong> (1943), directed by Zoltan Korda and starring Humphrey Bogart, an American tank is lost in the Libyan desert. Biblical allusions abound as the crew searches for water, hoping for a miracle. No Jewish characters are portrayed in the film, but there are clear hints of ‘ethnic substitution’ in Lawson’s screenplay. A black Sudanese Muslim and a Texan G.I. nicknamed ‘Waco’ eke water from an underground rock in a scene signifying interracial brotherhood. An Italian prisoner of war, refusing to conspire with a Nazi also held captive by the tank crew, denounces Hitler in a speech evocative of Shakespeare’s Shylock:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>‘But are my eyes blind that I must fall to my knees to worship a maniac who has made of my country a concentration camp, who has made of my people slaves? Must I kiss the hand that beats me, lick the boot that kicks me, no! I rather spend my whole life living in this dirty hole than escape to fight again for things I do not believe against people I do not hate. As for your Hitler, it’s because of a man like him that God – my God – created hell!’\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>As a member of the ‘Hollywood Ten,’ Lawson defied the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), accusing them of wanting to ‘muzzle the great Voice of democracy … [and] attack Negroes, Jews, and other minorities.’ He served nine months in Federal prison in 1950-51 for contempt of Congress. Blacklisted thereafter, he adapted ‘Cry the Beloved Country,’ also directed by Korda, for the screen, but novelist Alan Paton received sole credit.

Born to a Karaite family in Cairo in 1930, Maurice Shammas was raised in \u003Cem>harat al-yahud\u003C/em>, the old Jewish quarter, and educated in Egyptian schools. Prior to his departure from Egypt in 1951, Shammas had worked as a journalist, and was involved in Egyptian theater.

It is a literary canon that falls between two stools and thus is deemed not to exist. The English Literature academic establishment, on the one hand, has long since subsumed writers from most of the globe— especially from America, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales— into the canon of “English” letters. Recent literary histories of modern English literature simply ignore British-Jewish writers or treat them as if they were not part of the culture as a whole. No wonder that British-Jewish writers have been either smothered at birth or, more usually, been simply left out in the cold. Judaic literary scholars, on the other hand, have tended to assume that the American-Jewish diaspora is synonymous with the Jewish diaspora tout court and that Anglo therefore equals American (to quote George Bernard Shaw: ‘Americans and Britons are divided by a common language’). From the narrow perspective of exile and national rebirth, European writers are divided retrospectively into those who published before and after the Holocaust, with Britain occupying a strangely untouched space on the sidelines. Bemused students are often surprised to discover that authors such as Harold Pinter, Anita Brookner and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala can also be read Jewishly. Still, it is worth making a virtue of this marginality as British-Jewish writers have turned their very sense of marginality into lasting drama, poetry and fiction. The inbetweenness of modern British-Jewish writers has led to an extraordinary growth in the inventiveness and originality of this literature since the 1980s and this is beginning to be recognized generally.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"oppositional-culture-and-american-jewish-literature\">Oppositional Culture and American Jewish Literature\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Laurence Roth\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/oppositional-culture-and-american-jewish?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/RothPlotz170.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/oppositional-culture-and-american-jewish?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/rothHeeb.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/modern-jewish-literatures/oppositional-culture-and-american-jewish?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901170608im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/rothLostTribe.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here are three examples illustrating the infiltration of oppositional culture into American Jewish \u003Cem>belles lettres\u003C/em> and literature. Whether termed ‘alterna-Jews’ or ‘New Jews,’ exponents of a Jewish oppositional culture, or of ‘radical Jewish culture’ (a phrase borrowed from John Zorn and his circle of klezmer experimentalists), aim to subvert or recontextualize the tired narratives, stale images, and fey sounds dogging American Jewish culture and religiosity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The covers of \u003Cem>Plotz: The Zine for the Vaclempt, Heeb: The New Jew Review,\u003C/em> and \u003Cem>Lost Tribe: Jewish Fiction from the Edge\u003C/em> illustrate the look of such a Jewish oppositional culture as well as a contemporary anxiety not only about the tenacity of negative Jewish images, but also about the meaning of Jewishness in an American context: Is Jewishness just a \u003Cem>shtick\u003C/em>, just some funny act in American popular and mass culture, or is it something more relevant and durable?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Plotz , which ran from 1995 to 2002, was a zine based in New York City and produced by Barbara Rushkoff, née Kligman. A zine, short for ‘fanzine’ or ‘fan magazine,’ is an amateur literary production―independently produced and distributed, usually photocopied or offset printed―that reflects a sub-cultural (or at least one person’s idiosyncratic) take on popular phenomena and obsessions. Rushkoff yoked zine writing practices and attitudes with Jewish humor and thereby repositioned Jewishness in her zine as another type of oppositional culture within zine subcultures of the 1990s. \u003Cem>Plotz’s\u003C/em> cultural significance is that it evidences how the discourse of a Jewish oppositional culture originated, in part, in the American zine scene.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Issue number ten (1998) took aim at popular images of the Jewish woman. Its front cover is a clip-art image of a Black woman with an afro whose eyes have been replaced by Jewish stars. Through such graphic subversions Rushkoff linked, in a provocative way, the experience of Black and Jewish women, underscoring how popular images of feminine beauty marginalize Black and Jewish women’s physical and cultural differences. \u003Cem>Plotz\u003C/em> consistently sprung critiques of white, middle-class femininity, and consistently ‘talked back’ to negative, condescending, or idealized popular images of Jewish women through such manipulations of clip-art images.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Heeb: The New Jew Review\u003C/em> is a bridge between the zine scene and commercial American Jewish literature. Its founding editor, Jennifer Bleyer, was a zine writer in the Ohio indie punk scene and the publisher of \u003Cem>Mazel-Tov Cocktail\u003C/em>, a one-issue New York zine. \u003Cem>Heeb\u003C/em> complicates our understanding of what happens when capital and cultures of opposition collide. For while \u003Cem>Heeb\u003C/em> may provide a kind of voyeuristic access to a consumption-based identity―the ‘New Jew’ brand―it also enables a young and skeptical readership, one committed to democratizing American Jewish cultural literacy, to situate itself within the wider currents of American society and culture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Issue number three, ‘Up, Up, and Oy Vey’ (Spring 2003), uses a visual stereotype of the Hasidic Jew―black hat, exaggerated \u003Cem>payess\u003C/em>, silk \u003Cem>kapote\u003C/em>―as a vehicle for both laughing at \u003Cem>and\u003C/em> reclaiming the Jewish origins of Superman. Such a ‘Superjew’ reflects Jewish pride even as it pokes fun, in the same manner as \u003Cem>Plotz\u003C/em>, at a popular image of male strength ostensibly at odds with Jewish men’s physical and cultural differences.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Paul Zakrzewski’s \u003Cem>Lost Tribe: Jewish Fiction from the Edge\u003C/em>, an anthology of new Jewish fiction published in 2003, illustrates how oppositional culture has been incorporated into the packaging of American Jewish literature. The visual vocabulary of the cover incorporates two figures that evoke yet another stereotypical popular image of Jewish men, one signified by the white kippot and Jewfros. The graffiti title, \u003Cem>Lost Tribe\u003C/em>, emphasizes not only a ‘tagging,’ a naming, but also an absence that is underscored by the faceless figures sitting underneath the title. Zakrzewski’s book visually evokes \u003Cem>Plotz\u003C/em> and \u003Cem>Heeb\u003C/em> (Zakrzewski was the original features editor of \u003Cem>Heeb\u003C/em>); all three publications use similar kinds of images to advertise themselves as narratives about lost identities, ones occluded by the stereotypes and clichés of popular culture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thus the discourse of a Jewish oppositional culture, cribbed wittingly and unwittingly from zines, has become an important component in the refiguring and marketing of contemporary American Jewishness and the literature that explores and conveys it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Arendt, Hannah.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess.,\u003C/em> Edited by Liliane Weissberg; Translated by Richard and Clara Winston (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Band, Arnold J.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Studies in Modern Jewish Literature\u003C/em>.

Jewish artists have been respected contributors to modern music, film, theater, and visual art, and their activities encompass high art, mass media, and popular culture forms. But what is \"Jewish Art?\" Any art produced by Jews? Any art with Jewish content? Is there a distinctive Jewish style?\n\nMost of these questions presume standards set by conventional cultural histories, which despite universalizing goals, define the arts in national terms. Does that mean, then, that Jewish art is exclusively made in Israel, the modern Jewish state, or does it also describe art made by Jews in the Diaspora? Clearly, the questions that emerge from this study of Jewish art and culture are bound to the most pressing concerns of modern Jewish history generally, as well as to questions concerning the production and valuation of modern art.\n\nFor a study of Jewish art and culture, diversity acquires additional significance, beyond the variety of forms and media. These works express a diverse \"Jewish-ness\" -- belying the homogeneity that the term \"modern Jewry\" implies. They testify to the diversity among Jews, the many ways of being a modern Jew, and through the arts, suggest ways of constructing a modern Jewish identity. At the same time, while often preoccupied with the concerns of Jewish community, Jewish artists in the modern period have avoided parochialism and participated in the many national cultures of which they are also a part. This participation extends to culture's institutional forms: its markets and commerce, its museums and academies, media distributions and technology-all sites where Jews have played an active and formative role.\n\nOur exhibit offers a few examples of works that address these issues and our discussions this year. Each Fellow has selected an image from a particular branch of the arts that represents the strength and the challenge of modern Jewish culture. They demonstrate the extraordinary depth and variety of Jewish art, and suggest, we hope, new avenues of cultural research.\n\nCarol Zemel\n\n# Exhibit\n\n## Art\n\n### **Maurycy Gottlieb, Self-Portrait, 1878**\n\nEzra Mendelsohn\n\n![img_16.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_16.png)\n \nIn this beautiful painting Maurycy Gottlieb presents himself to us in the formal attire favored by Central European intellectuals of his time. But he also seems to be accentuating his \"Jewish features \" - his rather thick lips, half-closed, melancholy eyes, and large nose. He therefore presents to the world his twin identity as \"European, \" even \"Pole \" ( \"Maurycy, \" or, as he was known in the German-speaking lands, \"Moritz \") and as Jew ( \"Moshe, \" or \"Moyshe \"). The co-existence within Gottlieb's soul of these two identities provides a key to the understanding of the life and work of this pioneer \"Jewish artist. \"\n\n### **Ken Aptekar, _Her Father Dragged Her from Shtetl to Shtetl \\[with a sewing machine\\]_**\n\nCarol Zemel\n\n![img_17.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_17.png)\n \nKen Aptekar's paintings deal with ethnic and gender stereotypes. This image, _Her Father Dragged Her from Shtetl to Shtetl \\[with a sewing machine.\\]_(1996), uses Francois Boucher's Portrait of Mme. Pompadour (1756) as its source, and delivers witty and moving insight on the modern Jewish woman. The text portion, etched in glass that covers the painted surface, is long and detailed; reading it carefully demands that the viewer's attention crawl over every detail of painted ribbon, frill and furbelow. Mme Pompadour, and Rococo style of painting have long been considered the essence of \\_frou-frou\\_femininity in our culture, but it is a femininity of wealth and aristocracy, of leisure play and frill, of gentle curves and erotic theater. And while it seems so remote from _shtetl_ story of Mierle Pomerance (not Pompadour), schlepping her sewing machine from town to town as she \"fashioned clothes for Jews, \" the sense of fashion, fate and fantasy draws the two women close. \"'A couturihre your grandma could've been,' my mother says, \" in the syntax of translated Yiddish. The story ends with the artist's greater sense of possibility-- \"I escaped when I became an artist \" -but leaves the Jewish woman sewing for the far-off Jewish princess, whose cultural standard is set -still- by the Pompadour.\n\n### **Ben Shahn, Mural for the Jersey Homesteads, 1936-37 Roosevelt Public School, Roosevelt, New Jersey**\n\nDianna Linden\n![img_21.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_21.png)\n![img_19.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_19.png)\n![img_18.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_18.png)\n![img_20.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_20.png)\n \nIn 1936, Ben Shahn (1898-1969) was selected to create a mural for the Jersey Homesteads, a Jewish workers' utopian community in New Jersey. This was the first mural that Shahn completed under the New Deal, and he painted it in true fresco which he mastered as an apprentice to Diego Rivera. Inspired by Rivera, by Italian Renaissance frescoes, modernist montage and avant-garde film (Shahn was friends with film theorist Jay Leyda), Shahn created a multi-level fresco sub-divided into individual vignettes, and marked by quick thematic and temporal shifts. Divided into three main sections, the untitled fresco represents Jewish immigration to America, the oppressive tenements and sweatshops of New York, and the reforms demanded by labor unions and those provided by the New Deal. Rather than a path specific to Jews, Shahn proposes a direction for the whole working class to follow. Namely, to build cross-union and inter-cultural alliances, to move back to the land, and live by the example of the Jersey Homesteads.\n\n## Music\n\n### \"ENTARTETE MUSIK\" - Degenerate Music\n\nMarion Kant\n\n![img_15.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_15.png)\n \nAfter Hitler seized power in January 1933 the Nazis immediately installed racial laws and expelled political enemies and generally unwanted people from German society. They made a more or less normal life impossible for those, whom they labelled \"degenerate\", \"unhealthy\" or \"sick\". By the end of the 1930s the Nazis had begun to gas helpless inmates of insane asylums, the educationally sub-normal and the physically crippled. 75,000 German citizens died in the so-called \"Action T4\" and another 400, 000 were forcibly sterilized. The gassing of these innocent and harmless people stopped in 1941 because the Nazi regime needed the experienced gassing teams to set up the death camps at Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor and Maidanek.\n\nBehind the aggressive Darwinian culling of what the Nazi called the hereditarily unfit lay a deep cultural pessimism. Three generations of prophets of doom like Spengler had foretold _den Untergang des Abendlandes_ or the _Decline of the West_. The preachers of disaster had taught them that Western and in particular German civilisation and culture were in decline and one of the agents of that decline was what the Germans called untranslatably _Das Judentum_ or Jewry. The Jews represented the faceless modern world, the loss of community, and urban development. They became the scapegoats for everything from slums to female emancipation, a deeply threatening aspect of modern life. This cultural anti-Semitism was a new variant of an old paranoia, but it was on a different scale. Judaism was no longer rejected as a religion, with all its awful implications. It was turned into a race. Cultural pessimism and social Darwinism reinforced each other. Jews were parasites, as Hitler was fond of explaining and in nature healthy organisms exterminated parasitic life forms. In the social world, healthy humanity, that is, the Aryan race, had to cull the parasitic Jewish one. The Jews had to be stripped of civil rights, isolated and removed from humanity. Hitler declared that he wanted the Jews eradicated and an entire nation worked towards that goal.\n\nThe ideological mechanisms produced one-dimensional explanations. Thus, for the Nazis, artists fell under the category of \"Jewish\" as soon as they did not submit to the prescribed cultural policies. Modernity was Jewish, consequently modern composers had to be Jewish. Jazz was Jewish, hence jazz musicians per se were Jewish. For some artists this was an honorary title: the writer Erich Maria Remarque, who wrote the famous _All Quiet on the Western Front_ asked for his novels to be included, when the books were burnt in Berlin in May 1933. He wished to be a member rather of \"Jewish society, \" not a German one, which had made such murderous distinctions. The exhibitions of \"Entartete Kunst \" staged in June 1937 and on \"Entartete Musik \" that followed in May 1938 were public displays of such thinking. The Nazis saw them as powerful ideological instruments and, therefore, intrinsically political, in service to the racial state.\n\nThe Nazis took art and music seriously: deadly seriously. They saw them as powerful ideological instruments and, therefore, intrinsically political, in service to the racial state. Because the Nazis politicised the arts, some artists and critics have reacted since 1945 by claiming that the arts must be apolitical. Is that an acceptable response to the barbarous misuse of artistic activity? This is an important question, which every artist has to answer in her or his own way. It is an illusion to imagine that we can escape the realities of a highly political world by ignoring the close relationship of politics and arts. The arts are not now above politics any more than they were in the 1930s.\n\n### Paul Robeson's \"Chassidic Chant of Levi Isaac of Berditschev\"\n\nJonathan Karp\n\n![img_8.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_8.png)\n \nRobeson's concert repertoire was always eclectic, reflecting not just his linguistic virtuosity but also the Left's ideological commitment to internationalism and \"the songs of many lands \" (he also performed _Chin Chin, the Chinese marching song_, an Eskimo ballad, a Gaelic folksong, the _Volga Boat Song_, and _Loch Lomand_, as well as numerous operatic pieces in different languages and a large number of spirituals). Nevertheless, as early as the 1920s, Robeson professed the belief that the cultural and musical affinities between blacks and Jews are qualitatively unique and transcendent ones.\n\n### Zahava Ben sings Arabic, Israel, 1995\n\nAmy Horowitz\n\n![img_10.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_10.png)\n![img_9.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_9.png)\n \nIn early 1995, Zahava Ben released a CD on her own label, entitled _Zahava Ben sings Arabic_. The silver and gold cover portrays Ben inscribed within the profile of the renowned Egyptian singer, Umm Kulthum. Later, in the fall of 1995, in the aftermath of Prime Minister Rabin's assassination, Moroccan Israeli singer, Zahava Ben released a CD of Umm Kulthum repertoire on the Helicon label. As many Israelis and Palestinians embraced a shared experience of grief over Rabin's death and the unsettling peace prospects, Zahava Ben's CDs and appearances in Nablus and Jericho resonated with musical, political, and commercial overtones.\n\n### Contemporary Jewish Music in America 1960s-1990s\n\nMark Kligman\n\n![img_12.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_12.png)\n![img_11.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_11.png)\n![img_13.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_13.png)\n![img_14.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_14.png)\n \nThe growth of Jewish music over the past few decades has been staggering. While it is impossible to provide an exact number of recordings, since no distributors or retail outlets service the entire Jewish community, members of the industry estimate that there are currently over 2,000 recordings of Jewish music available and close to 250 records released each year. There are over four hundred artists and groups performing Jewish music today and most listeners and consumers are aware of only a few. The creation of new Jewish music, which ranges greatly in terms of musical styles, is found throughout the Jewish community: religious communities, Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Renewal; Yiddishists, Yiddish songs and klezmer music; Israeli; and, art music composers and established popular artists. Jewish music has arrived and is a growing industry.\n\n***\n\nShlomo Carlebach was an important transitory figure in the world of American Jewish Music. He was born in Germany, his father was a rabbi, and trained in a yeshiva. While serving as a rabbi in New Jersey in the 1950s he began to write music. His songs combine aspects of hassidic music and folk music. Like hassidic music Carlebach songs are in two or three parts with each part repeating. Carlebach songs are \"folk\" music in that the melodies are accessible and easy to sing. He sang songs in various Jewish and non-Jewish contexts seeking to engage young Jews into their tradition. Music was his vechicle. One of his earliest recordings Shlomo Carlebach at the Village Gate provides an example of his well-known songs based on a verse from psalms, \"Eso Einai.\"\n\n***\nAn American born baby boomer generation sought to experience Judaism and adapt their American journey. Avraham Fried is a Lubavitcher Hasid living in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. His music is popular in the community. His songs are in Hebrew, Yiddish and English that are Hassidic in origin or original. One popular song is \"Didoh Bei\" which is based on a passage from the Talmud Nedarim 41a, \"If you have knowledge\", the song was written by Yossi Green. \"Didoh Bei\" is commonly heard at Orthodox weddings. The musical style combines pop music and Middle Eastern rhythms and styles.\n\n***\n\nDebbie Friedman grew up feeling that liturgy in the synagogue was not accessible. She sought to make liturgy prayerful and participatory. She began writing music for youth services in the 1970s and as a song leader she created participatory services at summer camps. For two and half decades her music has become widely known throughout American Reform and Conservative synagogues. Some of her most popular liturgical melodies are \"Oseh Shalom\" and \"Mi Shebeirach.\" Her English songs provide new insights to biblical passages such as \"Miriam's Song\" and \"L'chi Lach.\" The song \"L'chi Lach\" is an interpretation of the biblical passage Lech Lecha, Abraham's call to go out.\n\n***\n\nAmerican born musicians who played traditional music started the Klezmer Revival of the 1970s, they sought to discover the music of their heritage. The 78 rpm recordings of the 1920s and 1930s served as models for repertoire and style, the recordings of legendary clarinetist Dave Tarras and Naftule Brandwein. At first the klezmer revivalists reproduced the earlier recordings then they sought to innovate and adapt. Three renditions of \"Der Heyser Bulgar\" \\[\"The Hot Bulgar\"\\] trace this line of development: Brandwein's 1920s recording, the Klezmer Conservatory Band with Itzhak Perlman, and by the fusion klezmer band The Klezmatics, who instead of full band instrumentation only use percussion with more ornamentation. The birth of new music among secular Yiddishists is growing, one example is The Well, new Yiddish songs based on poetry with the songs written and sung by Chava Alberstein with the Klezmatics, \"Zayt Gezunt\" \\[\"Farewell\"\\]).\n\n## Theater & Film\n\n### \"Teater kunst tsu der akeyde\"\n\nNina Warnke\n\n![img_5.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_5.png)\n\nThe cartoon \"Teater kunst tsu der akeyde \" (The Attempt to Sacrifice Theater Art) by Lola (pseudonym of the painter Leon Israel, 1887-1955) was published on 2 September 1910 in the Yiddish satirical magazine Der groyser kundes. It is a trenchant critique of the Yiddish theater managers who after having supported literary plays for years had recently produced a series of very popular sentimental melodramas. To critics invested in creating a literary theater this amounted to an unforgivable betrayal of the ideal of \"art.\"\n\n### \"Le-an nelech hashavu'ah?\" (\"Where shall we go to this week?\")\n\nAnat Helman\n\n![img_4.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_4.png)\n\nA caricature from a late 1930s periodical reflects the popularity of movie going amongst different sectors in Mandated Tel-Aviv. The couple on the left is dressed as typical elegant bourgeoisies; the next couple can be either Kibbutz members visiting the urban cultural center or a couple of urban workers (\"poalim\"), expressing their socialist-pioneering ideology through their simple clothing; the policeman represents municipal authority -- although in the early 1930s the autonomous Jewish municipal police force of Tel-Aviv was dispersed and combined into the general British police force; and the tiny boy indicates that in Tel-Aviv, like in many other countries at that time, children were eager movie consumers, worrying parents and educators as to potential corrupting effects.\n\n### Bromley Atlas. Borough of Manhattan\n\nJudith Thissen\n\n![img_3.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_3.png)\n\nThe growth in popularity of the moving pictures began with the nickelodeon around 1905-1906. These small storefront theaters offered a half hour program of moving pictures and illustrated songs for five cents (hence their name). The shows ran continuously from morning to evening. People went day after day, and from one theater to another. \"The moving pictures have totally revolutionized the Jewish district. It is heaven and earth and moving pictures,\" reported the Forverts (Jewish Daily Forward) in May 1908. The nickelodeon boom provided immigrant Jews and their children with unparalleled access to popular entertainment and profoundly changed their recreational patterns. Their enthusiasm for the cinema is exemplified by the fact that the Lower East Side had the highest density of nickelodeons in New York City.\n\n\n### Marcel Ophuls' Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie\n\nSusan Rubin Suleiman\n![img_1.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_1.png)\n![img_2.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_2.png)\nKlaus Barbie, the head of the Gestapo in Lyon from November 1942 to August 1944, escaped from Europe to South America after the war and was not returned to France until 1983; he was tried four years later and condemned to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity. The Barbie trial, a watershed in French memories of World War II and the Occupation, raised compelling moral and historical issues not only for France but for Germany and the United States (it came to light, decades after the war, that Barbie had worked for several years for the U.S. Army's Counter Intelligence Corps as an \"expert on Communism \").\n\nIn his 1988 Academy Award-winning documentary, _Hotel Terminus,_ Marcel Ophuls (famous for his earlier film about France under German occupation, _The Sorrow and the Pity_) explores brilliantly the moral and historical issues raised by the Barbie trial, and extends at the same time the art of documentary film. The image here, a black and white photograph taken around 1970, is the opening image of the film: it shows Barbie and two friends celebrating at a New Year's party in Peru. Barbie is the man in the middle, wearing a party hat, with a drink in one hand and an upraised cane in the other. On his right, with his arm around Barbie's neck, is Johannes Schneider-Merck, a young man at the time, who was defrauded soon afterward of a huge sum by Barbie and his pals in a currency speculation scheme. Schneider-Merck, noticeably older than he appears in the photo, is the first person whose memories of Barbie we hear in the film. By opening his documentary with a still photograph taken decades after Barbie's crimes in Lyon and more than a decade before his trial and the making of this film, Ophuls emphasizes the passage of time and the huge distance that exists between the historical subject of the film (the Nazi criminal Barbie) and those who remember him or try to follow his tracks forty years later. Ophuls' film presents \"the life and times of Klaus Barbie\" not as a linear story, but as a complicated collage of many people's memories of the man and the times.\n\n(For a detailed commentary on this film, see Susan Rubin Suleiman, \"History, Memory, and Moral Judgment in Documentary Film: On Marcel Ophuls' _Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie_,\" forthcoming in the journal _Critical Inquiry_ in 2001 or 2002).\n\n## Dance\n\n### Joseph Lewitan and the Nazification of Dance in Germany\n\nMarion Kant\n\nJoseph Lewitan was there when German modern dance became the one modern art, which the Nazis welcomed. Unlike literature, art or music, German Modern Dance was not declared \"degenerate\" but was celebrated as a truly German art form. Lewitan was one of the most important dance critics in Germany of his day, and he provides a way into that fascinating story about dance, nationalism and modernity.\n\nIn October 1927 the first issue of \"_Der Tanz,_ Monatsschrift für Tanzkultur - \"_Dance,_ A monthly Journal for Dance Culture\" - Lewitan's magazine - was published, the first serious dance journal in Germany. Lewitan's project began at a time when the dance world was locked in a bitter dispute. The core issue of this fierce confrontation was about 'modernity' and 'anti-modernity', about adequate artistic representation, about 'contemporary-ness' and embodiment of the present time. The battle of the dance types reflected the ideological, political and economical divisions in Germany from the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nSoon after the rise of Nazism Lewitan lost all his positions, which he had held in the dance world. In July 1933, \"Der Tanz\" announced that it was undergoing fundamental changes and a general reorganisation - Lewitan was replaced as editor and his magazine finally 'aryanised'.\n\nLewitan had entered Germany from Soviet-Russia in 1920 as a Russian and he left Germany as a 'stateless' Jew sometime between December 1937 and July 1938. He emigrated to Paris, fled from the German Wehrmacht just before they marched down the Champs-Élysées in June 1940 to the South of France and reached Casablanca in May 1942.\n\nIn dance history Lewitan has been identified as both: the \"destructive Jew\" who undermined German values by being part of modernity and the \"conservative\" Jew who could not accept or grasp modernity in an artistic form. He at the same time became a symbol of modernity as a destructive force and its opposite, a representation of anti-modernity as a destructive force. No attempts in history or theory have been made so far to resolve this terrible contradiction, this death sentence.\n\n## Institutions & Display\n\n### OFITSYELER VEGVAYZER NOYYORKER VELT-OYSSHTELUNG (Yiddish guide to the New York World's Fair, 1939/40)\n\nBarbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett\n\n![img_7.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_7.png)\n\nZionism was by no means the only basis for the Jewish presence at world's fairs. By the 1930s, however, the Zionist movement had succeeded in becoming the \"official\" national and international Jewish presence at the fair, nowhere more clearly than in the case of the Jewish Palestine Pavilion at the New York World's Fair, 1939/40. Described in much greater detail in the Yiddish guide to the Fair than in the English guide, the Jewish Palestine Pavilion exploited the slippage between the world itself and the world of the fair to perform de facto statehood. The design of the Palestine Pavilion and its contents was in accord with Meyer W. Weisgal's desires, which he recalled years later as \"something authentically Palestinian\" to show that \"in 1938 Jewish Palestine was a reality; its towns, villages, schools, hospitals and cultural institutions had risen in a land that until our coming had been derelict and waste... I wanted a miniature Palestine in Flushing Meadows.\" Insisting--with no trace of irony--that the pavilion should steer clear of politics, Weisgal applied himself to the \"construction of the Jewish State under the shadow of the Trylon and Perisphere, or, as the Jews were fond of calling it, the Lulav and Esrog.\"[^1]\n[^1]: Meyer W.

Jewish artists have been respected contributors to modern music, film, theater, and visual art, and their activities encompass high art, mass media, and popular culture forms. But what is “Jewish Art?” Any art produced by Jews? Any art with Jewish content? Is there a distinctive Jewish style?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most of these questions presume standards set by conventional cultural histories, which despite universalizing goals, define the arts in national terms. Does that mean, then, that Jewish art is exclusively made in Israel, the modern Jewish state, or does it also describe art made by Jews in the Diaspora? Clearly, the questions that emerge from this study of Jewish art and culture are bound to the most pressing concerns of modern Jewish history generally, as well as to questions concerning the production and valuation of modern art.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For a study of Jewish art and culture, diversity acquires additional significance, beyond the variety of forms and media. These works express a diverse “Jewish-ness” — belying the homogeneity that the term “modern Jewry” implies. They testify to the diversity among Jews, the many ways of being a modern Jew, and through the arts, suggest ways of constructing a modern Jewish identity. At the same time, while often preoccupied with the concerns of Jewish community, Jewish artists in the modern period have avoided parochialism and participated in the many national cultures of which they are also a part. This participation extends to culture’s institutional forms: its markets and commerce, its museums and academies, media distributions and technology-all sites where Jews have played an active and formative role.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Our exhibit offers a few examples of works that address these issues and our discussions this year. Each Fellow has selected an image from a particular branch of the arts that represents the strength and the challenge of modern Jewish culture. They demonstrate the extraordinary depth and variety of Jewish art, and suggest, we hope, new avenues of cultural research.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Carol Zemel\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h1>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"art\">Art\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"maurycy-gottlieb-self-portrait-1878\">\u003Cstrong>Maurycy Gottlieb, Self-Portrait, 1878\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Ezra Mendelsohn\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_16.png\" alt=\"img_16.png\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this beautiful painting Maurycy Gottlieb presents himself to us in the formal attire favored by Central European intellectuals of his time. But he also seems to be accentuating his “Jewish features ” - his rather thick lips, half-closed, melancholy eyes, and large nose. He therefore presents to the world his twin identity as “European, ” even “Pole ” ( “Maurycy, ” or, as he was known in the German-speaking lands, “Moritz ”) and as Jew ( “Moshe, ” or “Moyshe ”). The co-existence within Gottlieb’s soul of these two identities provides a key to the understanding of the life and work of this pioneer “Jewish artist. “\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ken-aptekar-her-father-dragged-her-from-shtetl-to-shtetl-with-a-sewing-machine\">\u003Cstrong>Ken Aptekar, \u003Cem>Her Father Dragged Her from Shtetl to Shtetl [with a sewing machine]\u003C/em>\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Carol Zemel\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_17.png\" alt=\"img_17.png\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ken Aptekar’s paintings deal with ethnic and gender stereotypes. This image, \u003Cem>Her Father Dragged Her from Shtetl to Shtetl [with a sewing machine.]\u003C/em>(1996), uses Francois Boucher’s Portrait of Mme. Pompadour (1756) as its source, and delivers witty and moving insight on the modern Jewish woman. The text portion, etched in glass that covers the painted surface, is long and detailed; reading it carefully demands that the viewer’s attention crawl over every detail of painted ribbon, frill and furbelow. Mme Pompadour, and Rococo style of painting have long been considered the essence of _frou-frou_femininity in our culture, but it is a femininity of wealth and aristocracy, of leisure play and frill, of gentle curves and erotic theater. And while it seems so remote from \u003Cem>shtetl\u003C/em> story of Mierle Pomerance (not Pompadour), schlepping her sewing machine from town to town as she “fashioned clothes for Jews, ” the sense of fashion, fate and fantasy draws the two women close. “‘A couturihre your grandma could’ve been,’ my mother says, ” in the syntax of translated Yiddish. The story ends with the artist’s greater sense of possibility— “I escaped when I became an artist ” -but leaves the Jewish woman sewing for the far-off Jewish princess, whose cultural standard is set -still- by the Pompadour.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ben-shahn-mural-for-the-jersey-homesteads-1936-37-roosevelt-public-school-roosevelt-new-jersey\">\u003Cstrong>Ben Shahn, Mural for the Jersey Homesteads, 1936-37 Roosevelt Public School, Roosevelt, New Jersey\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Dianna Linden\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_21.png\" alt=\"img_21.png\">\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_19.png\" alt=\"img_19.png\">\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_18.png\" alt=\"img_18.png\">\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_20.png\" alt=\"img_20.png\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 1936, Ben Shahn (1898-1969) was selected to create a mural for the Jersey Homesteads, a Jewish workers’ utopian community in New Jersey. This was the first mural that Shahn completed under the New Deal, and he painted it in true fresco which he mastered as an apprentice to Diego Rivera. Inspired by Rivera, by Italian Renaissance frescoes, modernist montage and avant-garde film (Shahn was friends with film theorist Jay Leyda), Shahn created a multi-level fresco sub-divided into individual vignettes, and marked by quick thematic and temporal shifts. Divided into three main sections, the untitled fresco represents Jewish immigration to America, the oppressive tenements and sweatshops of New York, and the reforms demanded by labor unions and those provided by the New Deal. Rather than a path specific to Jews, Shahn proposes a direction for the whole working class to follow. Namely, to build cross-union and inter-cultural alliances, to move back to the land, and live by the example of the Jersey Homesteads.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"music\">Music\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"entartete-musik---degenerate-music\">”ENTARTETE MUSIK” - Degenerate Music\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Marion Kant\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_15.png\" alt=\"img_15.png\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After Hitler seized power in January 1933 the Nazis immediately installed racial laws and expelled political enemies and generally unwanted people from German society. They made a more or less normal life impossible for those, whom they labelled “degenerate”, “unhealthy” or “sick”. By the end of the 1930s the Nazis had begun to gas helpless inmates of insane asylums, the educationally sub-normal and the physically crippled. 75,000 German citizens died in the so-called “Action T4” and another 400, 000 were forcibly sterilized. The gassing of these innocent and harmless people stopped in 1941 because the Nazi regime needed the experienced gassing teams to set up the death camps at Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor and Maidanek.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Behind the aggressive Darwinian culling of what the Nazi called the hereditarily unfit lay a deep cultural pessimism. Three generations of prophets of doom like Spengler had foretold \u003Cem>den Untergang des Abendlandes\u003C/em> or the \u003Cem>Decline of the West\u003C/em>. The preachers of disaster had taught them that Western and in particular German civilisation and culture were in decline and one of the agents of that decline was what the Germans called untranslatably \u003Cem>Das Judentum\u003C/em> or Jewry. The Jews represented the faceless modern world, the loss of community, and urban development. They became the scapegoats for everything from slums to female emancipation, a deeply threatening aspect of modern life. This cultural anti-Semitism was a new variant of an old paranoia, but it was on a different scale. Judaism was no longer rejected as a religion, with all its awful implications. It was turned into a race. Cultural pessimism and social Darwinism reinforced each other. Jews were parasites, as Hitler was fond of explaining and in nature healthy organisms exterminated parasitic life forms. In the social world, healthy humanity, that is, the Aryan race, had to cull the parasitic Jewish one. The Jews had to be stripped of civil rights, isolated and removed from humanity. Hitler declared that he wanted the Jews eradicated and an entire nation worked towards that goal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The ideological mechanisms produced one-dimensional explanations. Thus, for the Nazis, artists fell under the category of “Jewish” as soon as they did not submit to the prescribed cultural policies. Modernity was Jewish, consequently modern composers had to be Jewish. Jazz was Jewish, hence jazz musicians per se were Jewish. For some artists this was an honorary title: the writer Erich Maria Remarque, who wrote the famous \u003Cem>All Quiet on the Western Front\u003C/em> asked for his novels to be included, when the books were burnt in Berlin in May 1933. He wished to be a member rather of “Jewish society, ” not a German one, which had made such murderous distinctions. The exhibitions of “Entartete Kunst ” staged in June 1937 and on “Entartete Musik ” that followed in May 1938 were public displays of such thinking. The Nazis saw them as powerful ideological instruments and, therefore, intrinsically political, in service to the racial state.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Nazis took art and music seriously: deadly seriously. They saw them as powerful ideological instruments and, therefore, intrinsically political, in service to the racial state. Because the Nazis politicised the arts, some artists and critics have reacted since 1945 by claiming that the arts must be apolitical. Is that an acceptable response to the barbarous misuse of artistic activity? This is an important question, which every artist has to answer in her or his own way. It is an illusion to imagine that we can escape the realities of a highly political world by ignoring the close relationship of politics and arts. The arts are not now above politics any more than they were in the 1930s.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"paul-robesons-chassidic-chant-of-levi-isaac-of-berditschev\">Paul Robeson’s “Chassidic Chant of Levi Isaac of Berditschev”\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jonathan Karp\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_8.png\" alt=\"img_8.png\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robeson’s concert repertoire was always eclectic, reflecting not just his linguistic virtuosity but also the Left’s ideological commitment to internationalism and “the songs of many lands ” (he also performed \u003Cem>Chin Chin, the Chinese marching song\u003C/em>, an Eskimo ballad, a Gaelic folksong, the \u003Cem>Volga Boat Song\u003C/em>, and \u003Cem>Loch Lomand\u003C/em>, as well as numerous operatic pieces in different languages and a large number of spirituals).

There are over four hundred artists and groups performing Jewish music today and most listeners and consumers are aware of only a few. The creation of new Jewish music, which ranges greatly in terms of musical styles, is found throughout the Jewish community: religious communities, Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Renewal; Yiddishists, Yiddish songs and klezmer music; Israeli; and, art music composers and established popular artists. Jewish music has arrived and is a growing industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>Shlomo Carlebach was an important transitory figure in the world of American Jewish Music. He was born in Germany, his father was a rabbi, and trained in a yeshiva. While serving as a rabbi in New Jersey in the 1950s he began to write music. His songs combine aspects of hassidic music and folk music. Like hassidic music Carlebach songs are in two or three parts with each part repeating. Carlebach songs are “folk” music in that the melodies are accessible and easy to sing. He sang songs in various Jewish and non-Jewish contexts seeking to engage young Jews into their tradition. Music was his vechicle. One of his earliest recordings Shlomo Carlebach at the Village Gate provides an example of his well-known songs based on a verse from psalms, “Eso Einai.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>An American born baby boomer generation sought to experience Judaism and adapt their American journey. Avraham Fried is a Lubavitcher Hasid living in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. His music is popular in the community. His songs are in Hebrew, Yiddish and English that are Hassidic in origin or original. One popular song is “Didoh Bei” which is based on a passage from the Talmud Nedarim 41a, “If you have knowledge”, the song was written by Yossi Green. “Didoh Bei” is commonly heard at Orthodox weddings. The musical style combines pop music and Middle Eastern rhythms and styles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>Debbie Friedman grew up feeling that liturgy in the synagogue was not accessible. She sought to make liturgy prayerful and participatory. She began writing music for youth services in the 1970s and as a song leader she created participatory services at summer camps. For two and half decades her music has become widely known throughout American Reform and Conservative synagogues. Some of her most popular liturgical melodies are “Oseh Shalom” and “Mi Shebeirach.” Her English songs provide new insights to biblical passages such as “Miriam’s Song” and “L’chi Lach.” The song “L’chi Lach” is an interpretation of the biblical passage Lech Lecha, Abraham’s call to go out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>American born musicians who played traditional music started the Klezmer Revival of the 1970s, they sought to discover the music of their heritage. The 78 rpm recordings of the 1920s and 1930s served as models for repertoire and style, the recordings of legendary clarinetist Dave Tarras and Naftule Brandwein. At first the klezmer revivalists reproduced the earlier recordings then they sought to innovate and adapt. Three renditions of “Der Heyser Bulgar” [“The Hot Bulgar”] trace this line of development: Brandwein’s 1920s recording, the Klezmer Conservatory Band with Itzhak Perlman, and by the fusion klezmer band The Klezmatics, who instead of full band instrumentation only use percussion with more ornamentation. The birth of new music among secular Yiddishists is growing, one example is The Well, new Yiddish songs based on poetry with the songs written and sung by Chava Alberstein with the Klezmatics, “Zayt Gezunt” [“Farewell”]).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"theater--film\">Theater &#x26; Film\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"teater-kunst-tsu-der-akeyde\">”Teater kunst tsu der akeyde”\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Nina Warnke\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_5.png\" alt=\"img_5.png\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The cartoon “Teater kunst tsu der akeyde ” (The Attempt to Sacrifice Theater Art) by Lola (pseudonym of the painter Leon Israel, 1887-1955) was published on 2 September 1910 in the Yiddish satirical magazine Der groyser kundes. It is a trenchant critique of the Yiddish theater managers who after having supported literary plays for years had recently produced a series of very popular sentimental melodramas. To critics invested in creating a literary theater this amounted to an unforgivable betrayal of the ideal of “art.\"\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"le-an-nelech-hashavuah-where-shall-we-go-to-this-week\">\"Le-an nelech hashavu’ah?” (“Where shall we go to this week?”)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Anat Helman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_4.png\" alt=\"img_4.png\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A caricature from a late 1930s periodical reflects the popularity of movie going amongst different sectors in Mandated Tel-Aviv.

These small storefront theaters offered a half hour program of moving pictures and illustrated songs for five cents (hence their name). The shows ran continuously from morning to evening. People went day after day, and from one theater to another. “The moving pictures have totally revolutionized the Jewish district. It is heaven and earth and moving pictures,” reported the Forverts (Jewish Daily Forward) in May 1908. The nickelodeon boom provided immigrant Jews and their children with unparalleled access to popular entertainment and profoundly changed their recreational patterns. Their enthusiasm for the cinema is exemplified by the fact that the Lower East Side had the highest density of nickelodeons in New York City.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"marcel-ophuls-hotel-terminus-the-life-and-times-of-klaus-barbie\">Marcel Ophuls’ Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Susan Rubin Suleiman\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_1.png\" alt=\"img_1.png\">\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_2.png\" alt=\"img_2.png\">\nKlaus Barbie, the head of the Gestapo in Lyon from November 1942 to August 1944, escaped from Europe to South America after the war and was not returned to France until 1983; he was tried four years later and condemned to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity. The Barbie trial, a watershed in French memories of World War II and the Occupation, raised compelling moral and historical issues not only for France but for Germany and the United States (it came to light, decades after the war, that Barbie had worked for several years for the U.S. Army’s Counter Intelligence Corps as an “expert on Communism ”).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In his 1988 Academy Award-winning documentary, \u003Cem>Hotel Terminus,\u003C/em> Marcel Ophuls (famous for his earlier film about France under German occupation, \u003Cem>The Sorrow and the Pity\u003C/em>) explores brilliantly the moral and historical issues raised by the Barbie trial, and extends at the same time the art of documentary film. The image here, a black and white photograph taken around 1970, is the opening image of the film: it shows Barbie and two friends celebrating at a New Year’s party in Peru. Barbie is the man in the middle, wearing a party hat, with a drink in one hand and an upraised cane in the other. On his right, with his arm around Barbie’s neck, is Johannes Schneider-Merck, a young man at the time, who was defrauded soon afterward of a huge sum by Barbie and his pals in a currency speculation scheme. Schneider-Merck, noticeably older than he appears in the photo, is the first person whose memories of Barbie we hear in the film. By opening his documentary with a still photograph taken decades after Barbie’s crimes in Lyon and more than a decade before his trial and the making of this film, Ophuls emphasizes the passage of time and the huge distance that exists between the historical subject of the film (the Nazi criminal Barbie) and those who remember him or try to follow his tracks forty years later. Ophuls’ film presents “the life and times of Klaus Barbie” not as a linear story, but as a complicated collage of many people’s memories of the man and the times.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>(For a detailed commentary on this film, see Susan Rubin Suleiman, “History, Memory, and Moral Judgment in Documentary Film: On Marcel Ophuls’ \u003Cem>Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie\u003C/em>,” forthcoming in the journal \u003Cem>Critical Inquiry\u003C/em> in 2001 or 2002).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"dance\">Dance\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"joseph-lewitan-and-the-nazification-of-dance-in-germany\">Joseph Lewitan and the Nazification of Dance in Germany\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Marion Kant\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Joseph Lewitan was there when German modern dance became the one modern art, which the Nazis welcomed. Unlike literature, art or music, German Modern Dance was not declared “degenerate” but was celebrated as a truly German art form. Lewitan was one of the most important dance critics in Germany of his day, and he provides a way into that fascinating story about dance, nationalism and modernity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In October 1927 the first issue of “\u003Cem>Der Tanz,\u003C/em> Monatsschrift für Tanzkultur - “\u003Cem>Dance,\u003C/em> A monthly Journal for Dance Culture” - Lewitan’s magazine - was published, the first serious dance journal in Germany. Lewitan’s project began at a time when the dance world was locked in a bitter dispute. The core issue of this fierce confrontation was about ‘modernity’ and ‘anti-modernity’, about adequate artistic representation, about ‘contemporary-ness’ and embodiment of the present time. The battle of the dance types reflected the ideological, political and economical divisions in Germany from the beginning of the 20th century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Soon after the rise of Nazism Lewitan lost all his positions, which he had held in the dance world. In July 1933, “Der Tanz” announced that it was undergoing fundamental changes and a general reorganisation - Lewitan was replaced as editor and his magazine finally ‘aryanised’.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lewitan had entered Germany from Soviet-Russia in 1920 as a Russian and he left Germany as a ‘stateless’ Jew sometime between December 1937 and July 1938. He emigrated to Paris, fled from the German Wehrmacht just before they marched down the Champs-Élysées in June 1940 to the South of France and reached Casablanca in May 1942.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In dance history Lewitan has been identified as both: the “destructive Jew” who undermined German values by being part of modernity and the “conservative” Jew who could not accept or grasp modernity in an artistic form. He at the same time became a symbol of modernity as a destructive force and its opposite, a representation of anti-modernity as a destructive force. No attempts in history or theory have been made so far to resolve this terrible contradiction, this death sentence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"institutions--display\">Institutions &#x26; Display\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ofitsyeler-vegvayzer-noyyorker-velt-oysshtelung-yiddish-guide-to-the-new-york-worlds-fair-193940\">OFITSYELER VEGVAYZER NOYYORKER VELT-OYSSHTELUNG (Yiddish guide to the New York World’s Fair, 1939/40)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/ModernJewryArts/img_7.png\" alt=\"img_7.png\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Zionism was by no means the only basis for the Jewish presence at world’s fairs. By the 1930s, however, the Zionist movement had succeeded in becoming the “official” national and international Jewish presence at the fair, nowhere more clearly than in the case of the Jewish Palestine Pavilion at the New York World’s Fair, 1939/40. Described in much greater detail in the Yiddish guide to the Fair than in the English guide, the Jewish Palestine Pavilion exploited the slippage between the world itself and the world of the fair to perform de facto statehood. The design of the Palestine Pavilion and its contents was in accord with Meyer W. Weisgal’s desires, which he recalled years later as “something authentically Palestinian” to show that “in 1938 Jewish Palestine was a reality; its towns, villages, schools, hospitals and cultural institutions had risen in a land that until our coming had been derelict and waste… I wanted a miniature Palestine in Flushing Meadows.” Insisting—with no trace of irony—that the pavilion should steer clear of politics, Weisgal applied himself to the “construction of the Jewish State under the shadow of the Trylon and Perisphere, or, as the Jews were fond of calling it, the Lulav and Esrog.”\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>• \u003Cstrong>Kalman P.

Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies asked new questions about how the history of science, medicine and technology may be seen from the perspective of Jewish culture. They explored theories, institutions, and paradigms that shaped how Jews have studied nature, and the ideas, applications, and cultural and religious consequences that emerged in relation to Classical, Christian, Muslim, and/or secular approaches. This year's theme and the scholars who came together to research it, covered a wide spectrum of Jewish history, and were based in diverse fields like the history and anthropology of science, philosophy, engineering, medicine, and environmental studies. Through interdisciplinary and comparative approaches, they sought to better understand how Jews have understood, interacted with, or otherwise sought to intervene into nature. Among the subjects of inquiry were ecology and the environment, astronomical science; calendrical systems; geographical knowledge; medieval and early modern natural philosophy; the history of medicine; evolutionary biology; Spiritualism; contemporary research in genetics; as well as modern industrial technology. This year's web exhibition presents a sampling of some of the major currents presented during the past year.\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### The Deluge: Imagining the Generation of the Flood\n\nJulia Watts Belser\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-03/5.jpg)\n\nIn his acclaimed lithograph, “The Deluge,” the French artist and engraver Gustave Doré (1832-1883) imagines a scene from the Flood. Taking refuge atop a protruding rock, a mother tigress shelters her kits from the raging waters, while four human children are precariously balanced beside her. From below, two figures who are half submerged in the waves reach up toward the rock, straining to touch one of the children, who looks poised to fall into the water. In the foreground, a sunken man lifts a smaller body out of the waves; that figure no longer struggles, perhaps already drowned. Birds fly overhead, a serene counterpoint to the pathos below.\n\nAn image drawn from Doré’s acclaimed illustration of the English Bible (1866), “The Deluge” portrays the agonies of the Flood. While Doré himself was not Jewish, examining his lithograph alongside ancient Jewish sources reveals a striking shared engagement with the affective dimensions of divine destruction, a willingness to grapple with violence and loss. In Bavli Sanhedrin 108b, the Babylonian Talmud’s longest discussion of the flood, the rabbis grapple forthrightly with human and animal pain. Consider the raven, the bird that Noah first sends out to scout the land to see if the flood waters have subsided. It is a dangerous assignment. In the Talmud’s telling, the raven protests. While seven pairs of kosher animal species were present on the ark, the raven was one of a single pair. “If the prince of heat or the prince of cold strikes me,” the raven asks, “will not the world be lacking a creature?” This is, according to the Talmud, an irrefutable argument. Noah has failed to protect the raven from danger, to guard against the threat of extinction.\n\nWhile the biblical text imagines Noah as a “righteous man” who “found favor with God” (Genesis 6:9), Jewish tradition offers a more ambivalent, even critical portrait. A passage in the Zohar (_Midrash ha-ne’elam_) imagines Noah emerging from the ark, weeping when he sees the devastation of the flood. When Noah asks God why God had no compassion on the creatures, God responds, “Now you plead on their behalf? I lingered with you and spoke to you at length so that you would ask for mercy for the world. But as soon as you heard that you would be safe in the ark, the evil of the world did not touch your heart. You built the ark and saved yourself.”\n\nWhile generations of writers and artists have been captivated by the ark and the survivors, my heart is with the lost and left behind, the ones who drowned. I find in Doré’s image a haunting reminder of the violence that reigns outside that tiny floating sanctuary—as well as a call to strive not simply for personal sanctuary, but for a world where _all of us_ survive.\n\n### Mapping the World and its Avoidance in Rabbinic Literature\n\nEyal Ben-Eliyahu\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/ben-eliyahu-ptolemy1200%402x.jpg)\n\n![Cloverleaf map on Wikimedia Commons](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/1581_Bunting_clover_leaf_map.jpg)\n\nThe Ptolemaic map of the world is based on the detailed geographical description in Ptolemy's book _Geography_, written in Alexandria in the second century CE.\n\nExtant maps that rely on this description are from the medieval period. As in the Bunting clover leaf map, published in Germany in 1581, the Ptolemaic map divided the world into three continents: Asia, Europe and Africa. This division was first depicted in Ionia at Asia Minor in the mid-first millennium BCE, and is known as the Ionian map of the world.\n\nJewish texts from the Second Temple period, such as Jubilees and Josephus, adopted this model but with several changes. For example, they transferred the center of the world from Delphi in the Graeco-Roman maps to Jerusalem.\n\nIn contrast to the Ionian map, a world map carved into a clay table from Babylon reflects a markedly different perception of the world. This map depicts a large land mass surrounded by water, without the division into three continents.\n\nA survey of rabbinic literature reveals no mention of the division of the world into three continents. This contrasts with the earlier Jewish Hellenistic tradition and contemporary Roman geography. Rabbinic texts avoided the topic of world geography as well as the reduction in mentions of distant Jewish communities.\n\nI would like to suggest that this absence reflects the inward turn in the Jewish world that is characteristic of rabbinic literature. This inward-looking orientation was a political result of the Bar Kokhba revolt.\n\n### American Spiritualism under Scrutiny: the Seybert Commission Archive\n\nJulie Chajes\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/chajesj-furness900%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/chajesj-slates900%402x.jpg)\n\nSpiritualism became very popular in America in the 1850s and continued to be influential for decades afterwards. Although there were certain commonalities, Spiritualists did not share any particular theology. The only thing they had in common was the belief that it was possible to communicate with the spirits of the deceased through mediums (people who claimed to be able to communicate with the dead). This took place at seances, in which various techniques were used, such as the spirit supposedly speaking through the medium, or the medium writing the spirit's words on slates in answer to queries from those attending the seance.\n\nHenry Seybert (1801-1883) was a Spiritualist who endowed a chair in philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania on the condition that the university set up a commission to investigate Spiritualism. A year after Seybert's death the commission was established. It consisted mostly of University of Pennsylvania scientists and operated for two years. Among other things, the commission investigated Spiritualist slate writing and mediums who claimed to be able to answer questions sealed in envelopes by consulting the spirits.\n\nIn the photographs, you can see a question written by one of the members of the Seybert Commission, the Shakespearean scholar Horace Howard Furness (1833-1912). He asks, \"What was the name of the owner of this skull here in my library?\" The reply, written on the ourside of the envelope and received from a spirit called John King, was that it was the skull of Hannah Moore, who died in 1835, probably a reference to the English playwright and philanthropist (1745-1833). Another photo shows the red seals of the envelope, which are intact. (The letter was opened with a paper knife.) In the other two pictures you can see slates that were used in the testing of the mediums. On one is a question that was asked by the investigator and on the other the the reply given by the medium.\n\nThe members of the commission signed a preliminary report in 1887 in which they concluded that fraud had been used in nearly every case they had tested. In addition to the materials I have noted here, the Seybert Commission archive includes a very large number of letters and documents. It provides a fascinating snapshot of American Spiritualism in the late-nineteenth century.\n\n### Tuvia Goes to Holywood to Show that the Earth is Round\n\nYossi Chajes\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/chajesy900%402x.gif)\n\nTuvia (or Tobias) ha-Kohen (Metz, 1652-Jerusalem, 1729) authored _Ma'aseh Tuvia_ (first ed. Venice 1707). Although primarily remembered as a work written to bring \"modern\" medicine to Jews without access to learned practitioners, Tuvia's tome was, in fact, a feast of polymathic proportions. Its readers were exposed to a panoramic survey of the natural world, frequently enhanced by scientific images that ranged from anatomy to astronomy.\n\nAn oft-reproduced image in Tuvia's work—a demonstration that the world is round—shows a globe on the perimeter of which may be seen a large building and a ship connected by lines.\n\nTuvia's image (as well as its accompanying text) is based on one found in the influential _De Sphaera Mundi_ of John Holywood, better known as Johannes de Sacrobosco (perhaps the 1550 edition). It is also possible that he used a derivative work that included the same image and explanation, such as _Positiones suas physioastronomicas de sphaera coelesti_, published in Napoli in 1682.\n\n### Genetics and Jewish Identity\n\nYulia Egorova\n\n![Top left: Discover Magazine Razib Khan ](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/egorova1200%402x.gif)\n\nTop left: Discover Magazine Razib Khan \"Genetics & the Jews\" June 6, 2010\n\nAnthropological research on the concept of genomic sovereignty shows how the field of what has come to be known as 'Jewish genetics' tends to construct Jewishness as a biological category. By focusing on geneticists' and tests participants' narratives about community-level genomic mapping initiatives and ancestry tests, genetic research emerges here as an endeavour to achieve genomic sovereignty born out of relationally subaltern self-perceptions and concerns about inequality.\n\nWhile at first glance DNA testing used in the search for social and political recognition of different Jewish groups appears to be the 'weapon of the weak,' which could allow disenfranchised groups to subvert political and epistemological regimes privileging naturalist accounts of group membership, it should instead be theorized as a tool of subordination and control that is imposed upon these groups by those in position of political and economic power in the fields of contestation in question.\n\n### Between Disease and Symbol: Conceptualizations of Impurity\n\nYitzhaq Feder\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/feder1200%402x.jpg)\n\nThe biblical book of Leviticus dedicates two detailed chapters (13 and 14) to a skin disease called _tṣara‛at._ A person suspected of having this disease was required to consult a priest (_kohen_) who would determine based on the symptoms whether the person was “impure” or “pure.” If the former, the patient was isolated from the camp: “As for the person with a leprous affection, his clothes shall be rent, his head shall be left bare, and he shall cover over his upper lip; and he shall call out, “Unclean! Unclean!” He shall be unclean as long as the disease is on him. Being unclean, he shall dwell apart; his dwelling shall be outside the camp” (Lev 13:45–46; NJPS translation). These verses describe a practice of quarantine, which would constitute a necessary response to the threat of infectious disease. As a matter of fact, the textual record from ancient Syria from the early second millennium BCE attests to an awareness of the infectiousness of disease and the implementation of quarantine practices.\n\nIn modern research, hundreds of articles have been devoted to the question of whether this biblical disease should be identified with what is known today as “leprosy” (Hansen’s Disease). Some scholars have adamantly denied this identification, claiming that the symptoms of the biblical disease match no known disease, hence it is imaginary or symbolic, arguing further that the terminology of pure/ impure suggests a ‘religious’ rather than ‘medical’ diagnosis. In general, the pursuit of a retroactive diagnosis of historical diseases is a problematic enterprise, as it attempts to apply laboratory definitions of disease, available only for the past two centuries, to periods before they existed. More importantly, anachronistic approaches to ancient disease incumber understanding how disease was perceived and experienced in the pre-modern world.\n\nHow was the infectiousness of disease conceptualized before the emergence of germ theory? Here it seems that notions of pollution played a key role. Accordingly, the idea of impurity was closer to everyday experience, hence more ‘natural,’ than supernatural.\n\n### The Metamorphoses of a Medieval Book of (Ps.-) Science for the Dummies\n\nGad Freudenthal\n\n![fig. 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-03/1.jpg)\n\nIn 1245/7 a certain Gossuin (or Gauthier) of Metz compiled two versions (one in rhymes, the second in prose) of a work he entitled _Image du monde_ (_Image of the World_). It was a work of \"scientific vulgarization,\" written to the attention of the emerging town bourgeoisie and accordingly its prose version was in French. The work, which combines haphazard factual pieces of information and fantastic accounts, was highly popular in the following centuries (nearly one hundred manuscripts are extant) and it was printed very early.   \nfig. 1: A manuscript of the verse version of the work (copied ca. 1400).\n\n![fig. 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-03/2.jpg)\n\nNothing is known of any Jewish acquaintance with the _Image du monde_ until, out of the blue, an abbreviated Yiddish version appears in print in 1718/9 under the title Sēfer yedîʿat ʿôlām (reprinted: Altona, 1727/8). To this day, the translator/redactor remains anonymous.   \nfig 2: Title page of the _editio princeps_ of the Yiddish version.\n\n![fig. 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-03/3.jpg)\n\nJust a little later, in 1733, a Hebrew version, with the title _Tsel ha-‘olam_, was printed in Amsterdam. (_Tsel_ \\[= shadow\\] is apparently a corruption of _tselem,_ meaning “form,” “image.”) This version is much longer than the Yiddish, but nonetheless far from being a full translation of the prose version of Image du monde (which was its source-text). Only two Hebrew manuscripts of the work are known, both from the 16th century. The title page of the print edition (but not the manuscripts) ascribes the book to Matityahu Delacrat (or Delacraut), an astronomer and Kabbalist who, after having studied in Italy, lived in Poland in the middle of the sixteenth century. The exact nature of his contribution to this text is still under investigation.   \nfig 3: Title page of the 1733 _editio princeps_ of the Hebrew version.\n\n![fig. 4](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-03/4.jpg)\n\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the book was reprinted (with interpolations) at least 11 more times. Mendele Mocher Sforim (1836-1917) makes the hero of his T_ravels and Adventures of Benjamin the Third_ read it with amazement: readers then had a predilection for the marvelous and wondrous and this drew them to the 600-year-old book. (Possibly the much more serious Sefer ha-Berit by Rabbi Pinchas Elijah Hurwitz \\[1797\\] satisfied a similar need.)   \nfig. 4: Title page of the Munkacz printing of _Tsel ha-‘olam_ (1897).\n\n### Medical Polemics: Isaac Cardoso's Las Excelencias de los Hebreos\n\nRobert Juette\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/juettetitle900%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/juette346-900%402x.jpg)\n\np. 346, including a passage on haemorrhoids  \n\\[Amsterdam : Impresso en casa de David de Castro Tartas, 1679\\]\n\nIsaac Cardoso (b. 1603 or 1604-d. 1683), whose parents were _marranos,_ studied medicine, philosophy, and natural sciences at Salamanca and became chief physician (_physico mor_) in Madrid. In 1635 he left Spain and went to Venice where he changed his Christian name to “Isaac”. In his work _Las Excelencias de los Hebreos_ he refutes many “calunias” (calumnies) brought against Jews; viz., the claim that Jewish males menstruated by means of haemorrhoids. Cardoso does this by telling an autobiographical anecdote. The Spanish physician Juan de Quiñones de Benavente who had claimed that Jewish men are subject to menstrual periods, had been his patient while he was chief physician in Madrid. Cardoso reports, “Within a very short time he developed haemorrhoids in certain parts, so great and huge, and accompanied by blood and pain, that they actually seem tail-like. In the company of a surgeon I then said to him: ‘Your honour must also be liable in the sin of that death \\[i. e. of Christ\\], for we see in you the same affliction, and just as you have written that the Jews have a tail and blood, you too have the same’.”\n\n### Darwin and his Jewish Readers: Naphtali Levy's Toldot Adam \\[The Origins of Man\\]\n\nDaniel Langton\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/langton900%402x.jpg)\n\nNaphtali Levy (1840-94) has an important place in our story since he is that rare thing, an ostensibly orthodox Jewish thinker enamoured of Darwin, and since he was the first to translate excerpts from Darwin’s writings into Hebrew in his study Toldot Adam \\[The Origins of Man\\] (Vienna: Spitzer & Holzwarth, 1874), 60pp..\n\nBorn in Kolo, Poland, Levy was the son of a _dayyan_ or religious judge and received a traditional religious education (with teachers including Meir Auerbach, who was later the first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Jerusalem) until he moved to Posen for secular studies in science and modern languages, when he became interested in the _Haskalah_ or Jewish Enlightenment. From 1860-67 he earned his living as a tutor for a wealthy family and as a merchant in Radom, Poland, and it was while there that he wrote Toldot Adam, originally publishing it in the _Haskalah_ journal Ha-Shachar (The Dawn) in 1874. In 1877 he moved to London where, after unsuccessful careers as a newspaper editor and as a boot manufacturer, he was appointed as _shochet_ or ritual slaughterer for the London Board of _Shekhita,_ a position which he held until his retirement in 1892. He wrote other works on _halakhic_ matters, but never again on science.\n\nIn any examination of the 34 year-old Levy’s six-chapter, sixty-page book on Darwinism, one should bear in mind that it was not a sombre, systematic treatment, but was exuberant in style and highly apologetic in nature. The author had had an exciting new world opened up to him through reading The Origin of Species in German translation—three editions of which existed by that time, by Bronn (1860, 1863) and by Bronn and J. V. Carus (1867)—and had come to the realization that this revelation of the underlying reality of the natural world could be reconciled with his religious tradition. He was therefore evangelical in seeking to communicate this precious realization to the perplexed of his generation, who were confused by the claims and counter claims of the religion and science debate. In his study, which incorporated around ten short translations from Darwin’s writings, Levy’s core message was that the Torah and rabbinic traditions actually contained within them the theory of transmutation of forms, the sages having intuited the scientific truths that Darwin, Haeckel and others had uncovered in their painstaking researches in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe main focus of Toldot Adam is to be found in the fourth and fifth chapters in which were presented the key challenges to received religious tradition. Here Levy outlined how all of life was connected through evolution, from plants to animals to humans. This was hinted at in rabbinic texts such as Midrash Rabbah 11 (‘Everything that was created in the six days of creation needs to have something done to it; even man needs improvement’). It was even more clearly indicated by biblical texts such as Genesis 2:6 (‘there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground’), which taught that the plant life that carpeted the planet had, through its metabolic use of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen, made possible the evolution of animals and humans. More than any pious motivation to bring glory to the Creator, it appeared that it was the new scientific awareness of the explanatory power of natural laws that caught Levy’s imagination. For example, in discussing the emergence of hominids, he portrayed natural selection as a natural force working in harmony with the divine will to improve the stock of humanity. God’s contribution was indirect or even secondary, in that He was understood to have changed the environment in which humans were located and this migration, according to evolutionary theory, allowed natural selection to generate new adaptations. (According to Levy’s reading of Genesis 2:8 \\[‘and God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed’\\], God had formed man in the west and later moved him east to Eden.)\n\nIt would be mistaken to see the young Levy as a traditionalist offering nothing more than an evolutionary _midrash._ At times he offered speculations uncharacteristic of one espousing an Orthodox religious worldview. For example, in contrast to other Jewish evolutionists who rejected the apparent cruelty and chance of natural selection, Levy’s God reigned over a natural world undeniably shaped by the darwinian ‘struggle for existence’; in fact it was from this suffering that morality could evolve. And he occasionally let slip, writing of Nature’s command ‘Let there be light!’ and even suggesting that the image of an ape-like hominid was a more accurate portrayal of the first man than was the biblical claim of divine likeness. In a short appendix, Levy also discussed the future evolution of mankind, expressing the hope that one day man would no longer die, and even the possibility that there would arise other creatures, higher still on the ladder of life than humans.\n\nHe continued to write, but never again on the subject of evolution; other publications included a miscellaneous collection entitled Hikre Kadmoniyot (Researches in Antiquity, 1862), an exposition of the laws relating to the fifth commandment, Hilkhot Kibbud Av va-Em (Laws Honouring Parents, 1883), dissertations on legal and homiletic subjects entitled Kadesh Naftali (Naphtali’s Sacred Things, 1891), and Nakhalat Naftali (Naphtali’s Inheritance, 1892), which included an historical account of rabbis in England in the pre-Expulsion period and which listed the Chief Rabbi of Berlin, Israel Hildesheimer, among those authorizing and approving the work. In his final years he moved away from London to Southport for reasons of health and helped establish an Orthodox congregation there.\n\n### Warding Off Evil and Illness: An Oriental Hebrew Amulet\n\nAgata Paluch\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/paluch900%402x.jpg)\n\nIn the premodern world, magical and practical kabbalistic material abounds in various, sometimes unexpected formats. Individual recipes and formulas may be found in virtually any handwritten codex, from the Talmudic and calendrical, to the mathematical, poetical, and liturgical, and found as marginal notes, added inscriptions on flyleaves or title-pages, and appendices. In a more consistent manner, practical manuals of various lengths appear in multiple-text volumes, which alongside various recipes compile theosophical-speculative kabbalistic treatises or fragments thereof. There exists a great number of self-contained books comprising solely of recipes and practical advice, both of kabbalistic and non-kabbalistic character—among the latter category, the how-to books of remedial and dietary advice prevail.\n\nApart from recipes and formulas extant in the independent medieval and early modern codices, a number of amulets as finished products—that is written for a specific person or persons—have been preserved. One such artefact, an amulet written in a late Oriental script, is now held by the Library at the Katz Center. It was written for Rivkah bat Miriam, whose name is inserted in the protective formula at the top of the amulet. The amulet was intended to safeguard its owner from evil and illness. Since in the premodern world at least some of the causes of maladies were thought to originate in the supernatural realm, so were the measures taken to prevent and heal those medical conditions. The format of the amulet is quite standard, consisting of formulas which employ various constellations of divine and angelic names familiar from the Jewish magical and practical kabbalistic writings, such 72- and 42-letter divine name. The side panels which surround the main body of the amulet feature a series of angelic names. The top panel features three angelic names Senoy, Sansenoy, Semangelof enclosed within three bird-like shapes, a graphic element well-known from the printed edition of _Sefer Raziel_ (Amsterdam, 1701).\n\n### Charting the Heavens: Jews and Astronomy\n\nPavel Sladek\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/4-ljs498-189v-marked189-900%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/2-ljs64-6-7called7v-8-rmarked6-7-1200%402x.jpg)\n\nA group of Hebrew manuscripts produced between the 1550s and 1630s attests to the interest in astronomy of a small but significant circle of early modern Ashkenazi scholars spanning several generations. The manuscript evidence shows that they worked with a coherent corpus of texts which were copied and commented upon in a cumulative way. Some major figures such as R. Moses Isserles as well as some lesser known scholars such as Mattatiah Delacrut, Manoah Handel ben Shemariah, and Hayyim Lisker were part of this circle. The existence of these Hebrew manuscripts has been known to scholars, however, their content was usually dismissed as unoriginal. Upon closer inspection, and in the context of the general history of science, they tell a different story. MS UPenn LJS 498 from the Lawrence J. Schoenberg Collection, a miscellany of astronomical texts, belongs to this family of manuscripts and speaks to these issues.\n\nLJS 498 contains the medieval Sephardic scholar Abraham bar Hiyyaʼs _Tsurat ha-arets_ and other astronomical and calendrical texts, including a treatise on the astrolabe. Bar Hiyyaʼs work, composed four hundred years earlier, was still deemed relevant by sixteenth-century scholars. The Hebraists Sebastian Münster and Erasmus Oswald Scheckenfuchs translated and published parts of it in Latin (Basle 1547). The presence of glosses of Manoah Handel ben Shemaria as well as the similarity of the diagrams connects MS UPenn LJS 498 with parts of another member of the group today found at Oxford University, MS Bodleian Library Opp. 696. A comparison of the two shows that the origin of some of the diagrams is in the Wittenberg edition of Peurbachʼs Theorica (1542). Opp. 696 features even the Latin captions, which are omitted in LJS 498. It is likely, then, that LJS 498 was copied from Opp. 969.\n\nThe generic features of this family of manuscripts, of which other members can be found in Oxford, Paris or Moscow, point to a shared interest in astronomy, calendrical issues and chronology, rather than to the exceptional interest of a few, unconnected individuals. The repeated presence of astrolabe charts accompanied by how-to manuals attests to their widespread interest in and involvement with astronomic observations. Their awareness of the 1542 edition of Peurbach is also important. Noel Swerdlow characterized Peurbachʼs _Theoricae novae planetarum_ as “the principal textbook of planetary theory in Copernicusʼs time.” Moreover, the Wittenberg edition contained a commentary by Erasmus Reinhold, who was acquainted with Copernicusʼs heliocentric theory even before the publication of _De Revolutionibus_ in 1543.\n\nAs material texts, the empty spaces in the manuscripts and otherwise unfinished drafts indicate occasional failed attempts to integrate the sophisticated diagrams into the text. The diagrams were deemed both essential and difficult to obtain. For these Ashkenazi Jewish students of astronomy, these drawings reflected an impulse to connect with their Christian counterparts. R. Moses Isserles promised the readers of his Hebrew commentary on Peurbach that “an intelligent man who already knows something of this discipline can study and understand his commentary in its entirety on his own, especially if he has at his disposal the diagrams found in the Latin/Christian _Theorica_,“ which he states is “widespread among them (i.e. the Christians)….” Special attachments containing astronomic diagrams and charts, sometimes with moving parts attached with thread, are then yet another common feature of our Hebrew manuscripts (present both in MS Opp. 696 and MS UPenn LJS 498), analogous to Christian book culture of the period, and attested by a Latin manuscript also found in the Schoenberg Collection, namely, MS UPenn LJS 64, which contains a beautifully designed set of illustrations to Peurbachʼs _Theoricae_.\n\n### Calendar Controversies: Ms Halper 332\n\nSacha Stern\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sternfolio1r900%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sternfolio1v900%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sternfolio2r900%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sternfolio2v900%402x.jpg)\n\nCairo Genizah fragment, from a late eleventh-century book containing copies of letters written by Rav Saadya Gaon in 921-923, in Baghdad, to his former disciples in Fustat (Cairo). The letters are in Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic; but at the end of this letter (on the left), the names of the addressees are written in Arabic.\n\nIn these letters, Saadya reprimands his disciples for observing the Jewish festivals on the wrong dates. In the years when the letters were written, the Rabbanite Jews of Palestine and Iraq disagreed about the dates of the new moons and festivals. Saadya's disciples, in Egypt, were misled by the early appearance of the new moon crescent, and as the result, they sided with the Jews of Palestine. This episode illustrates the complex relationship between the religious calendar and the rhythms of nature.\n\nOther folios of this manuscript are currently held in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and in the Cambridge University Library.\n\n### Walther Rathenau and the Second Industrial Revolution\n\nHeidi Voskuhl\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/voskuhl900%402x.jpg)\n\nWalther Rathenau's work and life (1867-1922) became one of the best-known exemplars of the history of emancipated Jews in Imperial Germany. His father, Emil Rathenau, had founded the centralized conglomerate Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG), the German General Electric Company. Walther dutifully studied engineering, and learned the ropes of big business in various subsidiaries of his father's corporation. As an adult, he continued to travel throughout Europe, South America, and Africa, and eventually succeeded his father at the helm of the German General Electric Company. He also served on numerous boards, and became one of Europe's major economic leaders. Rathenau attained the highest government office that was ever reached by a Jew in Germany by becoming Germany's first, and so far only, Jewish foreign minister. He was assassinated on the 24th June 1922, less than six months after his appointment, shot and murdered by two young right-wing former German officers.\n\nRathenau belonged to a small group of prominent men who raised theoretical questions about the roles of technology, engineering, industrialism in their age, often called the \"Second\" Industrial Revolution. He lived in close proximity not only to technology, but to the technologies of the Second Industrial Revolution—electricity and chemical engineering. He was director and executive board member of companies in the electrical and chemical industries, and, crucially, the electrical and chemical industries played in their heyday of the Second Industrial Revolution not only a technical but also a political role—as models for society, for the state, and for politics. Rathenau was an industrialist, a social philosopher, and a statesman. His views of electrical industry and electricity as a special case of liberal industrial capitalism involved that the profound change in society through electricity and electrical engineering did not originate from the consumer, but, instead, from the producer.\n\nRathenau was also active in cultural, artistic, and social elite circles, and he had his own ambitions as a writer. He produced smaller articles as well as monographs, and his ambition was to talk about nothing less than the question of modernity and its origins. One larger work of his is entitled The New State. It dates from March 1919, just after the end of the Great War. He says early on \"The global power of fifty years of the second German empire is gone. What pretended to be the German essence . . . has destroyed itself.\" Rathenau continues by claiming that the revolution will fulfill itself not overnight, and instead through a series of creations of the people. Concluding this passages, he perhaps unintentionally reproduces one of the best-know stereotypes of Germans, back then and nowadays: \"In spirit and our form of life, we are as mechanized as all the other peoples. Also, we have not invented mechanization, but have acquired it with our enormous thoroughness, and then brought it to perfection\" (pages 9-16).\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Belser, Julia Watt.** _Power, ethics, and ecology in Jewish late antiquity: rabbinic responses to drought and disaster_.

Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies asked new questions about how the history of science, medicine and technology may be seen from the perspective of Jewish culture. They explored theories, institutions, and paradigms that shaped how Jews have studied nature, and the ideas, applications, and cultural and religious consequences that emerged in relation to Classical, Christian, Muslim, and/or secular approaches. This year’s theme and the scholars who came together to research it, covered a wide spectrum of Jewish history, and were based in diverse fields like the history and anthropology of science, philosophy, engineering, medicine, and environmental studies. Through interdisciplinary and comparative approaches, they sought to better understand how Jews have understood, interacted with, or otherwise sought to intervene into nature. Among the subjects of inquiry were ecology and the environment, astronomical science; calendrical systems; geographical knowledge; medieval and early modern natural philosophy; the history of medicine; evolutionary biology; Spiritualism; contemporary research in genetics; as well as modern industrial technology. This year’s web exhibition presents a sampling of some of the major currents presented during the past year.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-deluge-imagining-the-generation-of-the-flood\">The Deluge: Imagining the Generation of the Flood\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Julia Watts Belser\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-03/5.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In his acclaimed lithograph, “The Deluge,” the French artist and engraver Gustave Doré (1832-1883) imagines a scene from the Flood. Taking refuge atop a protruding rock, a mother tigress shelters her kits from the raging waters, while four human children are precariously balanced beside her. From below, two figures who are half submerged in the waves reach up toward the rock, straining to touch one of the children, who looks poised to fall into the water. In the foreground, a sunken man lifts a smaller body out of the waves; that figure no longer struggles, perhaps already drowned. Birds fly overhead, a serene counterpoint to the pathos below.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>An image drawn from Doré’s acclaimed illustration of the English Bible (1866), “The Deluge” portrays the agonies of the Flood. While Doré himself was not Jewish, examining his lithograph alongside ancient Jewish sources reveals a striking shared engagement with the affective dimensions of divine destruction, a willingness to grapple with violence and loss. In Bavli Sanhedrin 108b, the Babylonian Talmud’s longest discussion of the flood, the rabbis grapple forthrightly with human and animal pain. Consider the raven, the bird that Noah first sends out to scout the land to see if the flood waters have subsided. It is a dangerous assignment. In the Talmud’s telling, the raven protests. While seven pairs of kosher animal species were present on the ark, the raven was one of a single pair. “If the prince of heat or the prince of cold strikes me,” the raven asks, “will not the world be lacking a creature?” This is, according to the Talmud, an irrefutable argument. Noah has failed to protect the raven from danger, to guard against the threat of extinction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While the biblical text imagines Noah as a “righteous man” who “found favor with God” (Genesis 6:9), Jewish tradition offers a more ambivalent, even critical portrait. A passage in the Zohar (\u003Cem>Midrash ha-ne’elam\u003C/em>) imagines Noah emerging from the ark, weeping when he sees the devastation of the flood. When Noah asks God why God had no compassion on the creatures, God responds, “Now you plead on their behalf? I lingered with you and spoke to you at length so that you would ask for mercy for the world. But as soon as you heard that you would be safe in the ark, the evil of the world did not touch your heart. You built the ark and saved yourself.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While generations of writers and artists have been captivated by the ark and the survivors, my heart is with the lost and left behind, the ones who drowned. I find in Doré’s image a haunting reminder of the violence that reigns outside that tiny floating sanctuary—as well as a call to strive not simply for personal sanctuary, but for a world where \u003Cem>all of us\u003C/em> survive.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"mapping-the-world-and-its-avoidance-in-rabbinic-literature\">Mapping the World and its Avoidance in Rabbinic Literature\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Eyal Ben-Eliyahu\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/ben-eliyahu-ptolemy1200%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/1581_Bunting_clover_leaf_map.jpg\" alt=\"Cloverleaf map on Wikimedia Commons\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Ptolemaic map of the world is based on the detailed geographical description in Ptolemy’s book \u003Cem>Geography\u003C/em>, written in Alexandria in the second century CE.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Extant maps that rely on this description are from the medieval period. As in the Bunting clover leaf map, published in Germany in 1581, the Ptolemaic map divided the world into three continents: Asia, Europe and Africa. This division was first depicted in Ionia at Asia Minor in the mid-first millennium BCE, and is known as the Ionian map of the world.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Jewish texts from the Second Temple period, such as Jubilees and Josephus, adopted this model but with several changes. For example, they transferred the center of the world from Delphi in the Graeco-Roman maps to Jerusalem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In contrast to the Ionian map, a world map carved into a clay table from Babylon reflects a markedly different perception of the world. This map depicts a large land mass surrounded by water, without the division into three continents.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A survey of rabbinic literature reveals no mention of the division of the world into three continents.

Although there were certain commonalities, Spiritualists did not share any particular theology. The only thing they had in common was the belief that it was possible to communicate with the spirits of the deceased through mediums (people who claimed to be able to communicate with the dead). This took place at seances, in which various techniques were used, such as the spirit supposedly speaking through the medium, or the medium writing the spirit’s words on slates in answer to queries from those attending the seance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Henry Seybert (1801-1883) was a Spiritualist who endowed a chair in philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania on the condition that the university set up a commission to investigate Spiritualism. A year after Seybert’s death the commission was established. It consisted mostly of University of Pennsylvania scientists and operated for two years. Among other things, the commission investigated Spiritualist slate writing and mediums who claimed to be able to answer questions sealed in envelopes by consulting the spirits.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the photographs, you can see a question written by one of the members of the Seybert Commission, the Shakespearean scholar Horace Howard Furness (1833-1912). He asks, “What was the name of the owner of this skull here in my library?” The reply, written on the ourside of the envelope and received from a spirit called John King, was that it was the skull of Hannah Moore, who died in 1835, probably a reference to the English playwright and philanthropist (1745-1833). Another photo shows the red seals of the envelope, which are intact. (The letter was opened with a paper knife.) In the other two pictures you can see slates that were used in the testing of the mediums. On one is a question that was asked by the investigator and on the other the the reply given by the medium.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The members of the commission signed a preliminary report in 1887 in which they concluded that fraud had been used in nearly every case they had tested. In addition to the materials I have noted here, the Seybert Commission archive includes a very large number of letters and documents.

Unclean!” He shall be unclean as long as the disease is on him. Being unclean, he shall dwell apart; his dwelling shall be outside the camp” (Lev 13:45–46; NJPS translation). These verses describe a practice of quarantine, which would constitute a necessary response to the threat of infectious disease. As a matter of fact, the textual record from ancient Syria from the early second millennium BCE attests to an awareness of the infectiousness of disease and the implementation of quarantine practices.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In modern research, hundreds of articles have been devoted to the question of whether this biblical disease should be identified with what is known today as “leprosy” (Hansen’s Disease). Some scholars have adamantly denied this identification, claiming that the symptoms of the biblical disease match no known disease, hence it is imaginary or symbolic, arguing further that the terminology of pure/ impure suggests a ‘religious’ rather than ‘medical’ diagnosis. In general, the pursuit of a retroactive diagnosis of historical diseases is a problematic enterprise, as it attempts to apply laboratory definitions of disease, available only for the past two centuries, to periods before they existed. More importantly, anachronistic approaches to ancient disease incumber understanding how disease was perceived and experienced in the pre-modern world.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How was the infectiousness of disease conceptualized before the emergence of germ theory?

From 1860-67 he earned his living as a tutor for a wealthy family and as a merchant in Radom, Poland, and it was while there that he wrote Toldot Adam, originally publishing it in the \u003Cem>Haskalah\u003C/em> journal Ha-Shachar (The Dawn) in 1874. In 1877 he moved to London where, after unsuccessful careers as a newspaper editor and as a boot manufacturer, he was appointed as \u003Cem>shochet\u003C/em> or ritual slaughterer for the London Board of \u003Cem>Shekhita,\u003C/em> a position which he held until his retirement in 1892. He wrote other works on \u003Cem>halakhic\u003C/em> matters, but never again on science.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In any examination of the 34 year-old Levy’s six-chapter, sixty-page book on Darwinism, one should bear in mind that it was not a sombre, systematic treatment, but was exuberant in style and highly apologetic in nature. The author had had an exciting new world opened up to him through reading The Origin of Species in German translation—three editions of which existed by that time, by Bronn (1860, 1863) and by Bronn and J. V. Carus (1867)—and had come to the realization that this revelation of the underlying reality of the natural world could be reconciled with his religious tradition. He was therefore evangelical in seeking to communicate this precious realization to the perplexed of his generation, who were confused by the claims and counter claims of the religion and science debate. In his study, which incorporated around ten short translations from Darwin’s writings, Levy’s core message was that the Torah and rabbinic traditions actually contained within them the theory of transmutation of forms, the sages having intuited the scientific truths that Darwin, Haeckel and others had uncovered in their painstaking researches in the nineteenth century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The main focus of Toldot Adam is to be found in the fourth and fifth chapters in which were presented the key challenges to received religious tradition. Here Levy outlined how all of life was connected through evolution, from plants to animals to humans. This was hinted at in rabbinic texts such as Midrash Rabbah 11 (‘Everything that was created in the six days of creation needs to have something done to it; even man needs improvement’). It was even more clearly indicated by biblical texts such as Genesis 2:6 (‘there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground’), which taught that the plant life that carpeted the planet had, through its metabolic use of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen, made possible the evolution of animals and humans. More than any pious motivation to bring glory to the Creator, it appeared that it was the new scientific awareness of the explanatory power of natural laws that caught Levy’s imagination. For example, in discussing the emergence of hominids, he portrayed natural selection as a natural force working in harmony with the divine will to improve the stock of humanity. God’s contribution was indirect or even secondary, in that He was understood to have changed the environment in which humans were located and this migration, according to evolutionary theory, allowed natural selection to generate new adaptations. (According to Levy’s reading of Genesis 2:8 [‘and God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed’], God had formed man in the west and later moved him east to Eden.)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It would be mistaken to see the young Levy as a traditionalist offering nothing more than an evolutionary \u003Cem>midrash.\u003C/em> At times he offered speculations uncharacteristic of one espousing an Orthodox religious worldview. For example, in contrast to other Jewish evolutionists who rejected the apparent cruelty and chance of natural selection, Levy’s God reigned over a natural world undeniably shaped by the darwinian ‘struggle for existence’; in fact it was from this suffering that morality could evolve. And he occasionally let slip, writing of Nature’s command ‘Let there be light!’ and even suggesting that the image of an ape-like hominid was a more accurate portrayal of the first man than was the biblical claim of divine likeness. In a short appendix, Levy also discussed the future evolution of mankind, expressing the hope that one day man would no longer die, and even the possibility that there would arise other creatures, higher still on the ladder of life than humans.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He continued to write, but never again on the subject of evolution; other publications included a miscellaneous collection entitled Hikre Kadmoniyot (Researches in Antiquity, 1862), an exposition of the laws relating to the fifth commandment, Hilkhot Kibbud Av va-Em (Laws Honouring Parents, 1883), dissertations on legal and homiletic subjects entitled Kadesh Naftali (Naphtali’s Sacred Things, 1891), and Nakhalat Naftali (Naphtali’s Inheritance, 1892), which included an historical account of rabbis in England in the pre-Expulsion period and which listed the Chief Rabbi of Berlin, Israel Hildesheimer, among those authorizing and approving the work. In his final years he moved away from London to Southport for reasons of health and helped establish an Orthodox congregation there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"warding-off-evil-and-illness-an-oriental-hebrew-amulet\">Warding Off Evil and Illness: An Oriental Hebrew Amulet\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Agata Paluch\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/paluch900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the premodern world, magical and practical kabbalistic material abounds in various, sometimes unexpected formats. Individual recipes and formulas may be found in virtually any handwritten codex, from the Talmudic and calendrical, to the mathematical, poetical, and liturgical, and found as marginal notes, added inscriptions on flyleaves or title-pages, and appendices. In a more consistent manner, practical manuals of various lengths appear in multiple-text volumes, which alongside various recipes compile theosophical-speculative kabbalistic treatises or fragments thereof. There exists a great number of self-contained books comprising solely of recipes and practical advice, both of kabbalistic and non-kabbalistic character—among the latter category, the how-to books of remedial and dietary advice prevail.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Apart from recipes and formulas extant in the independent medieval and early modern codices, a number of amulets as finished products—that is written for a specific person or persons—have been preserved.

It was written for Rivkah bat Miriam, whose name is inserted in the protective formula at the top of the amulet. The amulet was intended to safeguard its owner from evil and illness. Since in the premodern world at least some of the causes of maladies were thought to originate in the supernatural realm, so were the measures taken to prevent and heal those medical conditions.

The manuscript evidence shows that they worked with a coherent corpus of texts which were copied and commented upon in a cumulative way. Some major figures such as R. Moses Isserles as well as some lesser known scholars such as Mattatiah Delacrut, Manoah Handel ben Shemariah, and Hayyim Lisker were part of this circle. The existence of these Hebrew manuscripts has been known to scholars, however, their content was usually dismissed as unoriginal. Upon closer inspection, and in the context of the general history of science, they tell a different story. MS UPenn LJS 498 from the Lawrence J. Schoenberg Collection, a miscellany of astronomical texts, belongs to this family of manuscripts and speaks to these issues.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>LJS 498 contains the medieval Sephardic scholar Abraham bar Hiyyaʼs \u003Cem>Tsurat ha-arets\u003C/em> and other astronomical and calendrical texts, including a treatise on the astrolabe. Bar Hiyyaʼs work, composed four hundred years earlier, was still deemed relevant by sixteenth-century scholars. The Hebraists Sebastian Münster and Erasmus Oswald Scheckenfuchs translated and published parts of it in Latin (Basle 1547). The presence of glosses of Manoah Handel ben Shemaria as well as the similarity of the diagrams connects MS UPenn LJS 498 with parts of another member of the group today found at Oxford University, MS Bodleian Library Opp. 696. A comparison of the two shows that the origin of some of the diagrams is in the Wittenberg edition of Peurbachʼs Theorica (1542). Opp. 696 features even the Latin captions, which are omitted in LJS 498. It is likely, then, that LJS 498 was copied from Opp. 969.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The generic features of this family of manuscripts, of which other members can be found in Oxford, Paris or Moscow, point to a shared interest in astronomy, calendrical issues and chronology, rather than to the exceptional interest of a few, unconnected individuals. The repeated presence of astrolabe charts accompanied by how-to manuals attests to their widespread interest in and involvement with astronomic observations. Their awareness of the 1542 edition of Peurbach is also important. Noel Swerdlow characterized Peurbachʼs \u003Cem>Theoricae novae planetarum\u003C/em> as “the principal textbook of planetary theory in Copernicusʼs time.” Moreover, the Wittenberg edition contained a commentary by Erasmus Reinhold, who was acquainted with Copernicusʼs heliocentric theory even before the publication of \u003Cem>De Revolutionibus\u003C/em> in 1543.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As material texts, the empty spaces in the manuscripts and otherwise unfinished drafts indicate occasional failed attempts to integrate the sophisticated diagrams into the text.

Moses Isserles promised the readers of his Hebrew commentary on Peurbach that “an intelligent man who already knows something of this discipline can study and understand his commentary in its entirety on his own, especially if he has at his disposal the diagrams found in the Latin/Christian \u003Cem>Theorica\u003C/em>,“ which he states is “widespread among them (i.e. the Christians)….” Special attachments containing astronomic diagrams and charts, sometimes with moving parts attached with thread, are then yet another common feature of our Hebrew manuscripts (present both in MS Opp. 696 and MS UPenn LJS 498), analogous to Christian book culture of the period, and attested by a Latin manuscript also found in the Schoenberg Collection, namely, MS UPenn LJS 64, which contains a beautifully designed set of illustrations to Peurbachʼs \u003Cem>Theoricae\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"calendar-controversies-ms-halper-332\">Calendar Controversies: Ms Halper 332\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Sacha Stern\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sternfolio1r900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sternfolio1v900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sternfolio2r900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901105826im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sternfolio2v900%402x.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Cairo Genizah fragment, from a late eleventh-century book containing copies of letters written by Rav Saadya Gaon in 921-923, in Baghdad, to his former disciples in Fustat (Cairo).

His father, Emil Rathenau, had founded the centralized conglomerate Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG), the German General Electric Company. Walther dutifully studied engineering, and learned the ropes of big business in various subsidiaries of his father’s corporation. As an adult, he continued to travel throughout Europe, South America, and Africa, and eventually succeeded his father at the helm of the German General Electric Company. He also served on numerous boards, and became one of Europe’s major economic leaders. Rathenau attained the highest government office that was ever reached by a Jew in Germany by becoming Germany’s first, and so far only, Jewish foreign minister. He was assassinated on the 24th June 1922, less than six months after his appointment, shot and murdered by two young right-wing former German officers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Rathenau belonged to a small group of prominent men who raised theoretical questions about the roles of technology, engineering, industrialism in their age, often called the “Second” Industrial Revolution. He lived in close proximity not only to technology, but to the technologies of the Second Industrial Revolution—electricity and chemical engineering. He was director and executive board member of companies in the electrical and chemical industries, and, crucially, the electrical and chemical industries played in their heyday of the Second Industrial Revolution not only a technical but also a political role—as models for society, for the state, and for politics. Rathenau was an industrialist, a social philosopher, and a statesman. His views of electrical industry and electricity as a special case of liberal industrial capitalism involved that the profound change in society through electricity and electrical engineering did not originate from the consumer, but, instead, from the producer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Rathenau was also active in cultural, artistic, and social elite circles, and he had his own ambitions as a writer. He produced smaller articles as well as monographs, and his ambition was to talk about nothing less than the question of modernity and its origins. One larger work of his is entitled The New State. It dates from March 1919, just after the end of the Great War. He says early on “The global power of fifty years of the second German empire is gone. What pretended to be the German essence … has destroyed itself.” Rathenau continues by claiming that the revolution will fulfill itself not overnight, and instead through a series of creations of the people. Concluding this passages, he perhaps unintentionally reproduces one of the best-know stereotypes of Germans, back then and nowadays: “In spirit and our form of life, we are as mechanized as all the other peoples. Also, we have not invented mechanization, but have acquired it with our enormous thoroughness, and then brought it to perfection” (pages 9-16).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Belser, Julia Watt.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Power, ethics, and ecology in Jewish late antiquity: rabbinic responses to drought and disaster\u003C/em>.

The new faith was not only a spiritual movement, but also a political power which soon after its emergence changed the map of the entire Mediterranean basin, and beyond, as far as the gates of India. The most prominent Jewish communities in the early Middle Ages lived under Muslim rule. Politically and legally they were treated as a minority, as were the Christians, who in the first centuries of Islam actually constituted a numerical majority in many areas. Soon after being integrated politically into the realm of Islam most of these Jewish communities gradually integrated into the Arabic culture. Within this broad framework evolved Judeo-Arabic culture. The period between the 7th and the 11th century could be justly defined as formative for both societies – the Muslim one was actually shaped in this period, and the presence of the majority of Jewish population worldwide under Islam modified Jewish life profoundly.\n\nIt is crucial therefore to analyze the emergence of both societies during this period in order to understand their long-term relations as well as their new identities. Their shared culture was unique in the medieval context; it had no parallel anywhere in Christian Europe. In a broader historical context it may be seen as a continuation of ancient Near Eastern tradition, namely the Judeo-Aramaic and Judeo-Hellenistic cultures. Yet another important aspect of the relations between Jews and Muslims in the Middle Ages and early modern period is the “Ottoman experience”. This is the story of a mid-size Jewish community that had lived under Byzantine rule and underwent two profound changes: First it found itself under the rule of a young, assertive and vigorous Muslim empire, the Ottomans. Secondly, it was overwhelmed by an influx of immigrants and refugees from Spain, who eventually had become the dominant majority. These wide-ranging and complex sets of relationships received a fresh comparative examination in the Mediterranean-Islamic context by this year’s (2006-07) CAJS Fellows.\n\n#### Haggai Ben-Shammai\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### The saga of the critical edition of Ibn Tibbon's Hebrew translation of Saadya Gaon's Emunot ve-De\\`ot\n\nHaggai Ben-Shammai\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Ben-Shammai%201.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/religious-communities-islamic-empires/saga-critical-edition-ibn-tibbons?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Ben-Shammai2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/religious-communities-islamic-empires/saga-critical-edition-ibn-tibbons?item=1)\n\n**1) Saadya Gaon, Book of Beliefs and Convictions**  \nSaadya Gaon (882 - 942) was no doubt one of the giants of Jewish culture in the early Middle Ages. A Native of Egypt, during the period of his most important activity he lived in Baghdad, part of it as head of the Sura Yeshiva. Among his major accomplishments was the _Book of Beliefs and Convictions_, which is the first attempt by a prominent member of the Rabbinic establishment to present Rabbinic Judaism as a philosophical system, compatible with scientific and philosophical systems of his time. Like most works of Saadya Gaon in prose it was written in Judaeo-Arabic (entitled _Kitāb al-Amānāt wa-’l-i‛tiqādāt_), which made it accessible to Jewish intellectuals who were much better versed in Arabic culture than in the Jewish one. Also, Hebrew at that time did not have the necessary vocabulary that could be used for philosophical discourse. The Judaeo-Arabic text has survived in two almost complete manuscripts and numerous fragments. Two critical editions have been published by S. Landauer (1880) and J. QafiÎ (1972), the latter with a modern Hebrew translation.\n\n**2) Judah Ibn Tibbon (ca. 1120-ca. 1190)**  \nHe was the founder of a family of translators who were active in Provence. They were responsible for the translation of a considerable part of the Judaeo-Arabic classics and Arabic science into Hebrew. Born in Granada (Muslim Southern Spain), where he acquired mastering knowledge of Arabic, he emigrated to Lunel in Provence. One of his last, most mature works was the translation of Saadya's _Beliefs and Convictions_ (translated 1186). For more than eight centuries this work was studied by most Jewish scholars in Ibn Tibbon's translation. Consequently the book has been preserved in many manuscripts. It was first printed in Istanbul (Constantinople, 1562), and then in numerous editions, none of them critical. This translation has gained additional importance after it had transpired that there are considerable differences between the two main manuscripts that had been the basis for the critical edition of the Arabic text (Mss Oxford and St. Petersburg), and that the Ibn Tibbon translation in most cases supported the St. Petersburg version. In spite of this fact both editors of the editions of the Arabic text preferred the Ms Oxford. Subsequent research has shown that numerous Genizah fragments as a rule support the St. Petersburg version. A critical edition of Ibn Tibbon's translation has thus become a vital tool in establishing the text of the Arabic original, in addition to its being a scholarly desideratum in its own right for two main reasons: a) This is the text that was quite popular among Jewish readers for eight centuries who wanted to acquaint themselves with Saadya'a philosophy. b) It is one of a quite large number of texts that constituted the core of the canon of Jewish culture for centuries that as yet have not appeared in critical editions.\n\n**3) Henry Malter (1867-1925)**  \nA native of Galicia, He pursued his higher education and his Jewish modern scholarly training in Germany, where he received his Ph.D. (Heidelberg 1894) and rabbinical diploma (Berlin Hochschule 1898). In 1900 he was appointed professor of medieval philosophy and Arabic at the Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati; later he moved to Dropsie College where he taught until his demise. Beginning in Germany, and later in America he was one of the most prolific scholars in Jewish studies at the time. The gem of his oeuvre was _Saadia Gaon; His Life and Works_, Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1921 (reprinted several times), which has remained the classic work on the subject. On p. 372 of this book Malter wrote in the course of his discussion of Ibn Tibbon's translation: \"A critical edition based on all the existing MSS, and on a careful comparison of the Arabic recensions, including the Genizah fragments, has been prepared by the present writer and will be published soon after the present work\". With Malter's early demise the promised edition disappeared.\n\n**4) The discovery of Malter's lost work**  \nSince I came first to CAJS as a Fellow during the 1994-95 academic year, I have tried to find traces of Malter's edition which he promised in his book. Rumors had it at the time that it was somewhere in the basement of CAJS. All my inquiries during later years (when I returned in 2002 and 2007) with various members of the staff had not brought any results. In the spring of 2007 Dr. Arthur Kiron, the Curator of Penn’s Judaica collections, offered to help me find some uncataloged documents written by Solomon Skoss (a scholar of Judeo-Arabic who was one of the most prominent faculty of Dropsie College) that are kept in the archives of CAJS library. We went down to the archives for an extended period of time and searched through many documents but were unable to locate the particular Skoss writings we were looking for. But we did find two cardboard boxes with stickers on them saying \"Malter Saadia\". On opening the boxes we found that they contained the lost draft of Malter's critical edition of Saadya Gaon's _Emunot ve-De\\`ot_ and more.\n\n**5) The Contents of the Malter Boxes**\n\n1.  Text of Judah Ibn Tibbon's translation of Saadya Gaon's _Emunot ve-De\\`ot_: 312 pages (in cardboard files) in Malter's hand, accompanied by two apparati: a) Variant readings from MSS and early printed editions, referred to in the texts by Arabic numerals; b) Comparisons with the Judaeo-Arabic original, referred to in the text by Hebrew letters. There are additional references within the text in the form Arabic numerals in parentheses, but the actual part of these footnotes has not been found so far. The first file contains a brief undated document composed by the late Prof. Israel Efros. The document records the contents of the files, the structure of the edition and the siglae of the MSS. Preliminary checks have shown that the information contained in this document needs some corrections.\n    \n2.  Several hundred pages of an English translation of Maimonides' _Guide of the Perplexed_, in Malter's hand. Given extant translations in print this work may be relevant for scholars who are especially interested in comparing various translations of the Guide.\n    \n3.  A notebook containing a Hebrew translation of the part 1 of Qirqisani's _al-Anwar_, in Malter's hand. Prof. J. Blau in Jerusalem is working on a Hebrew translation of the entire work, and may be therefore interested in the text of this translation.\n    \n\n### Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire\n\nYaron Ben-Naeh\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Ben-Naeh.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe Ottoman city, its markets, its coffeehouses and streets have been the arena for the daily encounter of Muslims, Jews and Christians, natives and foreigners. The close contact between ethnic groups, and especially that of Jews and Muslims, had a significant role in their acculturation. Ottoman Jews, and Ottoman Jewish society in the early modern period were greatly influenced by Ottoman culture in its broadest sense. The various manifestations of this acculturation are a main theme evidenced in a wide range of sources, such as congregational institutions, via material culture at the domestic sphere as in the synagogue, to folklore, social norms and mentality.\n\n### Ms. Philadelphia, Halper 68\n\nSagit Butbul\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4440_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis manuscript contains a biblical glossary to I Kings in Judaeo-Arabic. This is but one of a group of glossaries, rather old, from the period before 1000 CE, in which the transliteration system is phonetic. J. Blau and S. Hopkins subsumed the spelling in these texts under the name “early phonetic Judaeo-Arabic spelling” (EPJAS). Biblical glossaries are lists of selected biblical words – usually, though by no means always, rare or difficult biblical words – and their renderings into Judaeo-Arabic. Sometimes writers of glossaries give not one meaning of a given word, but two and sometimes more; e.g. the biblical בירח (I Kings 6:37) in this glossary is translated as בשהר, בלהילל. We can see from this example several characteristics of early Judaeo-Arabic glossaries: the phonetic spelling (בשהר instead of the standardized JA spelling: באלשהר; בלהילל and not באלהלאל), the fact that a seemingly simple word (for speakers of modern Hebrew, at least) is given in this glossary, and that it receives not one, but two possible translations.\n\nIn a recent article (“On Aramaic Vocabulary in Early Judaeo-Arabic Texts written in Phonetic Spelling”, JSAI 32 (2006), 433-471) J. Blau and S. Hopkins treat three biblical glossaries of eastern origin. One of these glossaries is this very glossary to I Kings. Some of the words which appear in these glossaries can attest to their eastern, namely Babylonian origin: Aramaic words from the spoken Aramaic vernacular, which are not attested in the Judaeo-Aramaic of the Talmud and Geonic literature, but are to be found in non-Jewish Eastern dialects, as Syriac and Mandaic; for example, the translation וככילונאת to the biblical ובלולים (I Kings 6:8; see Blau and Hopkins, p. 464.).\n\n### Time, Myth and the History of Halakhah in the Late Gaonic Period\n\nYossi David\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4825_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nOur picture of the intellectual world of the tenth century Babylonian academies is far from being complete. However, due to the large quantity of Halakhic writings and their ambivalence approach toward non-legal aspects of the Talmud we tend to describe the Gaonic world as anti-mythic. Focusing on counter examples of such estimation offers a refreshing view on the Gaonic mythical consciousness and attitude toward Aggadic narratives. It is possible to trace back the apocalyptic theme mentioned in R. Sherira Gaon's famous epistle and the meaning and uses of this theme in the construction of historical picture of the Halakhah. Exposed there are the theological connections of Gaonic world with early gnostic and apocalyptical traditions on the one hand and Islamic theological principles on the other. R. Sherira Gaon and his son R. Haya did elevate Adam's figure to be the Father also draws their theological effort to reconstruct an entirely new concept of patriarchy.\n\n### Hebrew Panegyric, Jewish Court Culture, and the Articulation of Legitimacy\n\nJonathan Decter\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4690_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nHebrew poems in praise of men (panegyrics) were exchanged among Jewish intellectuals in the Islamic world from Iraq to al-Andalus and arguably constituted the most prevalent of medieval Hebrew secular genres. Scholars have dismissed panegyrics as unpalatable sycophancy anathema to modern literary tastes, which has resulted in the neglect of a rich source for studying the power structures of medieval Jewish societies and the ways in which political legitimacy was articulated and promulgated. Hebrew panegyrics are literary portraits that present constructions of Jewish power that were intimately bound to images of power in the contemporary Islamic milieu. Like the Arabic panegyrics offered to Caliphs and Muslim governors, Hebrew panegyrics praise addressees for their far-reaching reputations, their ability to render fair judgment, their noble lineage, their eloquence, their promotion of Jewish practice, and their efforts to thwart religious heretics. Panegyrics were not only shared among Jewish intellectuals belonging to a specific social network but also created a \"virtual court culture\" through the ritual exchange of texts over distances.\n\n### Mediterranean Jewish Merchants and the Conquests of the Normans\n\nJessica Goldberg\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4754_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/religious-communities-islamic-empires/mediterranean-jewish-merchants?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4779_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/religious-communities-islamic-empires/mediterranean-jewish-merchants?item=1)\n\nLetters among merchants make up one of the largest categories of documentary materials in the Cairo Geniza. Over 100 years of research by generations of scholars has shown that most letters come from groups of inter-connected merchants. Since some of these merchants wrote dozens of extant letters, and at least one received several hundred of them, many of these merchants’ names and lives are now known in a wealth of detail hitherto unprecedented for any “average” medieval person. Thanks to merchants’ descriptions of their activities, their goods, and their troubles, as well as their off-hand references to familial, communal, and political events, we have a unique window into the day-to-day workings of both the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean economies of the central Middle Ages.\n\nTwo documents in the Halper collection, Halper 389 and Halper 414, together form the longest extant mercantile letter in the Cairo Geniza. (Halper 414 is the small inserted second page, folded into the very long sheet that forms, as in most letters, both the writing surface and the wrapper of the letter). Not simply long, this letter, written around 1063 by the North African merchant Salama ibn Musa (Moses) the Sfaxi (from the town of Sfax), is one of the richest letters on political and military events. As he attempts to explain to his unhappy partner in Cairo why he has failed to do almost any productive business in the past year, Salama places the blame variously on movements and attacks by the Norman fleet against Sicily, small-scale warfare between the Sultan of North Africa and one of his wayward governors, payments to Bedouins for access to the olive groves of S. Tunisia, the difficulties of evading customs officers, and the machinations of jealous fellow merchants all over the central Mediterranean. Salama’s losses are our wealth: no letter in which business went well would ever tell us as much about how merchants tried to make a living.\n\n### The _Talkhīs_ of Yusuf b. Nuh and Abu al-Faraj Harun\n\nMiriam Goldstein\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Goldstein.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nBy the tenth century of the common era, the Jewish community of the Middle East and Mediterranean was a cosmopolitan group: Arabic-speaking, although well-versed in Hebrew and Aramaic, and steeped in the latest developments in theology, philosophy, medicine and astronomy, as rendered in Arabic by the scholars of the Arabic-speaking world. In order to effectively address such an audience, the exegete had to address these areas of knowledge and the assumptions that accompanied them. The Bible exegesis written in Arabic by Karaites and Rabbanites alike in the tenth and eleventh centuries exhibits this wide variety of subject matter, and reflects particularly strikingly the theological assumptions of the Jewish communities of the area, with their Mu'tazilite bent.\n\nThis page is from the _Talkhīs_ of the 10th century Karaites Yusuf b. Nuh and Abu al-Faraj Harun, both of whom were key figures in the formation of the Karaite house of study in Jerusalem, a thriving center of scholarship in the Jewish world during the tenth and eleventh centuries. The page is one version of their commentary on the story of the Tower of Babel, and reflects the exegetes' assumption of contemporary theological tenets regarding divine justice, as well as their familiarity with discussions of languages and their speakers in the Muslim world. This composition is preserved in at least seven different manuscripts in the collections of the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg, Russia. The page on display contains folios 39b-40a from MS Russian National Library Yevr.-Arab. I:4785, a 310 page manuscript written in a thirteenth-century semicursive Hebrew script.\n\n### Judah ben Elijah Hadassi Ha-‛Avel\n\nDaniel Lasker\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Lasker.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nHis major opus, Sefer Eshkol Ha-Kofer (“The Cluster of Henna,” cf. Canticles 1:14), the title page of which is pictured here, was published first in Eupatoria (Gözleve), 1836, with Caleb Afendopolo’s précis, Naḥal Eshkol (“The Stream of the Cluster”), which was composed in 1497. This book, written in 1148-1149, has a most peculiar style: 379 alphabets, starting alternately from beginning to end then end to beginning (alef to tav and tav to alef), and every stanza ends with the Hebrew letter khaf sofit (kha). The syntax and style make deciphering the book very difficult, but it is possible to understand the book with much effort. Eshkol ha-Kofer serves as a summa of Karaite Judaism as it had developed from the proto-Karaite Anan ben David to Hadassi himself. Both his legal determinations and his religious opinions seem to have their roots in his Karaite predecessors: Anan, Benjamin al-Nahawendi, Daniel al-Qūmisī, Ya‛qub al-Qirqisānī, Yefet ben Eli, Yūsuf al-Baṣīr (Joseph ha-Ro’eh), Yeshu‛a ben Judah, and others. It is no surprise, therefore, that most of Hadassi’s philosophical views are based on Islamic Kalām.\n\nHadassi’s most notable innovation was his recording of ten principles of Judaism. Hadassi was one of the first Jews, Rabbanite or Karaite, to formulate a systematic and detailed list of dogmas, preceding, thereby, Maimonides. There is nothing particular new or surprising in the contents of his listed; Hadassi admits that he, himself, had taken the principles (ishurim in his terminology) from his predecessors. Nonetheless, the manner in which he arranged them was a novelty in Jewish thought. These principles are: 1) Existence of a Creator; 2) the Creator’s eternity and unity; 3) creation of the world; 4) the ministry of Moses and the other prophets; 5) the truth of the Torah; 6) the obligation to know Hebrew; 7) the Temple is the residence of God’s glory and in-dwelling; 8) resurrection of the dead; 9) accountability; and 10) reward and punishment.\n\nHadassi’s importance is as a transitional figure, who was the last representative of the classical Karaism of the Land of Israel Mourners, and the first representative of new Byzantine forms of the religion. Hence, although Hadassi was in the main still loyal to the traditional Karaite Kalāmic philosophy, written among Muslims mainly in Judaeo-Arabic, he did adumbrate the newly emerging Byzantine school of late medieval Karaite philosophy, of which the first known full adherent was Aaron ben Joseph, writing 150 years after Hadassi.\n\n### Ancient Persian status-symbols adopted by the Arabs after the Conquest\n\nMilka Levy-Rubin\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Levy-Rubin.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe conquest of the East by the Arabs, was followed by the adoption of many practices and customs of the conquered societies. Among these were Persian Royal manners and status symbols which were used in order to distinguish between the different classes in Persian society. Persian society was a rigid caste society going back to very ancient times. Status symbols included special dress items such as special head-gear, foot-gear, expensive robes made of special fabrics and decorated with embroidered edges, bejeweled belts and swords, and horses and their paraphernalia including saddles, reins, and other horse ornaments. All of these were privileges of the upper classes only. The lower classes were required to dress with humility.\n\nHaving gone through a period of acculturation, the Muslims adopted this concept of a class society and applied it to the new society which they were forging. In this new society, the Muslims represented the privileged upper class, with its codes of dress and behavior, while the non-Muslims were required to adopt the part of the restricted lower class and dress and behave with humility. This is clearly perceived in the legal document articulating the social status of the dhimmis or non-Muslims, shurut ‛Umar written in the eighth century. The dress prohibitions made on the non-Muslims in the shurut reflect dress customs of the Persian society, while the manners and customs demanded of them are actually part of the code of behavior in the presence of the king or other high officials in the royal court or outside it.\n\nThe attached drawing found in the Scroll of Esther in the collection of the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, portrays Mordecai, who was accorded the special privilege of wearing a royal robe previously worn by the king, riding on a horse which had been ridden by the king, and paraded in the city square, led by Haman who proclaimed before him: \"This is what is done for the man whom the king desires to honour\" (Esther, 6:11). This ancient Persian royal custom, going back to very ancient times, was adopted by the Muslims. Upon their appointement, Muslims officials were given a prestigious horse and expensive robes, and their appointment was proclaimed when their horse was paraded in public. Non-Muslims were forbidden among other things, to use saddles or iron stirrups, and in many cases to ride horses altogether, as these were a clear symbol of nobility and therefore reserved for Muslims only.\n\n### Following in the Footsteps of Rav Ḥai Gaon's Lost Dictionary\n\nAharon Maman\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Maman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nRav Ḥai Gaon's dictionary, Kitāb al-Ḥāwi, composed in the late 10th or early 11th century, was unfortunately lost by the end of the thirteenth century, and only small vestiges have survived in the Cairo Genizah. It was the only one in the history of Hebrew and Aramaic lexicography to be organized anagrammatically. Up to 1890 it was only known through old quotations in Jewish works, then when some twenty leaves were discovered in the St. Peterburg’s Genizah collections. A. E. Harkavy published a sample of one leaf. In 1976 S. Abramson published another two leaves. More Genizah material was discovered in Cambridge both in the Taylor-Schechter and the Westminster College collections, and one leaf at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. Recently I published a critical edition of ten leaves (see “The Remnants of R. Ḥai Gaon’s Dictionary Kitāb al-Ḥāwi in the Adler and Taylor-Schechter Geniza Collections”, Tarbiz 69 (2000), pp. 341-421 \\[in Hebrew\\]; preceded by “Ḥai Gaon's Method in his Lexicon Kitāb al-Ḥāwi,” Studies in Ancient and Modern Hebrew in Honour of M. Z. Kaddari (ed. S. Sharvit), Ramat-Gan 1999, pp. 235-249 \\[in Hebrew\\]).\n\nFrom the cultural and social point of view this work reveals some striking features. Rav Ḥai Gaon quotes al-Khalil ibn Aḥmad’s Kitāb al-‛Ayn, the first dictionary ever composed by an Arab lexicographer (eighth century) and uses it for a better understanding of vague biblical words. Rav Ḥai’s openness to non-Jewish sources is also seen in his readiness to learn from the Christian tradition of the Catholicos of Baghdad to the understanding of a Psalm. This was a tenth century example of an open interfaith scientific dialogue.\n\n### Maimonides and the Dogma of Creation\n\nCharles Manekin\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Manekin.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn this autograph copy of Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah (Oxford, Bodleian Ms. Pococke 295) there are many marginal corrections and additions added by the great rabbi. One of these has to do with the fourth of Maimonides famous \"thirteen principles of Torah,\" the principle of divine priority. In the early version Maimonides did not include the dogma of creation; later he mentioned the dogma and its significance in the margin of his copy, thus raising the question whether there are other significant differences in his thought between his earlier and later writings.\n\n### Two Ersatz “Persian” Miniature Paintings\n\nVera Moreen\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Moreen.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/religious-communities-islamic-empires/two-ersatz-persian-miniature?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Moreen2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/religious-communities-islamic-empires/two-ersatz-persian-miniature?item=1)\n\nAmong the holdings of the Abraham J. Karp collection (Box 4, Item 9a-c) at CAJS are manuscript leaves containing miniature paintings in the Persian style. They are palimpsests as they are painted over (and thus conceal) parts of the texts with which they have no connection.\n\nThe first leaf is from an Arabic manuscript on ritual purity, a Kitāb al-ŧahārat (‛Book of \\[Ritual\\] Purity’), probably a section from one of the larger, popular Muslim legal codes. The text is copied in excellent script on blue paper, which is often of “eastern,” even Russian provenance. The miniature painting shows an amorous “picnic” with four figures arranged in two groups, two seated and two standing young men on a floral field against a beige background, with a bowl of fruits separating the groups. It is likely a homoerotic scene with three older men “courting” a younger man, a celebrated literary theme often depicted in Persian miniature paintings.\n\nThe second piece is a single leaf from a Persian manuscript from a popular collectionof tales about biblical and qur’anic prophets, involving here Daniel and Idrīs (Enoch), copied in excellent script on typical undyed oriental paper Its miniature is a highly animated scene of a polo match—the pastime par excellence of Persia and a common visual cliché of the Persianate tradition—depicting two horsemen who are chase the ball over a floral field, set against a light green background.\n\nThese miniatures are by the same, not wholly inexpert artist, and depict highly conventional (from the point of view of the tradition of Persian miniature paintings) scenes. They date no earlier than the late 19th century and, quite possibly, from the 20th century. Such fakes were and continue to be available on the market, especially in Israel, for the tourist trade.\n\n### Joseph ibn Nahmias and The Light of the World\n\nRobert Morrison\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Morrison.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nJoseph ibn Nahmias' (fl. 1400 CE) The Light of the World is the only known text on theoretical astronomy to be written by a Jew in any variety of Arabic. The Light of the World is the only known attempt to improve on the astronomy of the Muslim al-Bitruji (fl. 1200 CE). Al-Bitruji's astronomy itself was a representative of a rare tradition in which the planets' motions occurred on the surface of the celestial sphere, with the earth at the very center, and not in the plane of the zodiac. Ibn Nahmias was also trying to solve scientific problems posed by Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed.\n\nAlthough Joseph Ibn Nahmias comes from a well-known family, little is known about his life. His roots were in either Toledo, Aragon, or Castille. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, we have reports of his text turning up, probably via the Hebrew translation, in the Veneto.\n\n### \"The Great Eagle\"\n\nSarah Stroumsa\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Stroumsa.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Stroumsa2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n\"The Great Eagle\", an honorific often attached to the name of Moses Maimonides, underlines his regal position in the Jewish community. At the same time, the image of the wide-spread wings does justice to the breadth of his intellectual horizons. The circumstances of his life—exile, travels, and a forced conversion to Islam—gave Maimonides opportunities to encounter a particularly variegated list of political systems, cultural trends and systems of thoughts. His extraordinary personality and his insatiable intellectual curiosity drove him to make full use of these opportunities, integrating the various influences into his literary output.\n\nMaimonides' \"Eight Chapters\" are a short treatise on ethics, written as an Introduction to his Judeo-Arabic Commentary on tractate Avot . Its purpose was, as he said, to serve as \"a key to our following commentary.\" In the Preface to this treatise Maimonides forcefully formulates the guiding principle of his intellectual drive: \"Harken to the truth, whoever may have said it.\" Porta Mosis is a selection of Maimonides' topical Introductions to Mishnaic tractates. Published in 1655 by Edward Pocock, this publication served indeed as a key and a gateway, opening the way to the philological, non-theological study of Judaism and Islam.

Adding to the autochthonous layer of Arabs and Berbers were two new Muslim elements: Ottomans and Moriscos - Muslim Spanish exiles. The Jewish population was enlarged, first by Jewish Spanish exiles, then by immigrants from the Western Sephardi diaspora who constituted the local Leghorn branch (Livornese). Current research has barely touched on the integration of different religious groups into common economic or social networks. This is the topic of the proposed study: to characterize, on the basis of historical sources, the various networks that included Jews, to define their boundaries, and to analyze the significance of the intra-Jewish and inter-religious cooperation that comes to light.\n\nOne key source for the study is Algeria's Responsa literature from the 16th-18th centuries. This includes an important, unpublished manuscript from the early Ottoman period, by Rabbi Abraham Ibn-Tawaah.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n• **Abū al-Fatḥ ibn Abī al-Ḥasan, al-Sāmirī.** _The continuatio of the Samaritan chronicle of Abū L-Fatḥ Al-Sāmirī Al-Danafī,_ translated and annotated by Milka Levy-Rubin.

The new faith was not only a spiritual movement, but also a political power which soon after its emergence changed the map of the entire Mediterranean basin, and beyond, as far as the gates of India. The most prominent Jewish communities in the early Middle Ages lived under Muslim rule. Politically and legally they were treated as a minority, as were the Christians, who in the first centuries of Islam actually constituted a numerical majority in many areas. Soon after being integrated politically into the realm of Islam most of these Jewish communities gradually integrated into the Arabic culture. Within this broad framework evolved Judeo-Arabic culture. The period between the 7th and the 11th century could be justly defined as formative for both societies – the Muslim one was actually shaped in this period, and the presence of the majority of Jewish population worldwide under Islam modified Jewish life profoundly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It is crucial therefore to analyze the emergence of both societies during this period in order to understand their long-term relations as well as their new identities. Their shared culture was unique in the medieval context; it had no parallel anywhere in Christian Europe. In a broader historical context it may be seen as a continuation of ancient Near Eastern tradition, namely the Judeo-Aramaic and Judeo-Hellenistic cultures. Yet another important aspect of the relations between Jews and Muslims in the Middle Ages and early modern period is the “Ottoman experience”. This is the story of a mid-size Jewish community that had lived under Byzantine rule and underwent two profound changes: First it found itself under the rule of a young, assertive and vigorous Muslim empire, the Ottomans. Secondly, it was overwhelmed by an influx of immigrants and refugees from Spain, who eventually had become the dominant majority. These wide-ranging and complex sets of relationships received a fresh comparative examination in the Mediterranean-Islamic context by this year’s (2006-07) CAJS Fellows.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"haggai-ben-shammai\">Haggai Ben-Shammai\u003C/h4>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-saga-of-the-critical-edition-of-ibn-tibbons-hebrew-translation-of-saadya-gaons-emunot-ve-deot\">The saga of the critical edition of Ibn Tibbon’s Hebrew translation of Saadya Gaon’s Emunot ve-De`ot\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Haggai Ben-Shammai\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/religious-communities-islamic-empires/saga-critical-edition-ibn-tibbons?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Ben-Shammai%201.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/religious-communities-islamic-empires/saga-critical-edition-ibn-tibbons?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Ben-Shammai2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>1) Saadya Gaon, Book of Beliefs and Convictions\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nSaadya Gaon (882 - 942) was no doubt one of the giants of Jewish culture in the early Middle Ages. A Native of Egypt, during the period of his most important activity he lived in Baghdad, part of it as head of the Sura Yeshiva. Among his major accomplishments was the \u003Cem>Book of Beliefs and Convictions\u003C/em>, which is the first attempt by a prominent member of the Rabbinic establishment to present Rabbinic Judaism as a philosophical system, compatible with scientific and philosophical systems of his time. Like most works of Saadya Gaon in prose it was written in Judaeo-Arabic (entitled \u003Cem>Kitāb al-Amānāt wa-’l-i‛tiqādāt\u003C/em>), which made it accessible to Jewish intellectuals who were much better versed in Arabic culture than in the Jewish one. Also, Hebrew at that time did not have the necessary vocabulary that could be used for philosophical discourse. The Judaeo-Arabic text has survived in two almost complete manuscripts and numerous fragments. Two critical editions have been published by S. Landauer (1880) and J. QafiÎ (1972), the latter with a modern Hebrew translation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>2) Judah Ibn Tibbon (ca. 1120-ca. 1190)\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nHe was the founder of a family of translators who were active in Provence. They were responsible for the translation of a considerable part of the Judaeo-Arabic classics and Arabic science into Hebrew. Born in Granada (Muslim Southern Spain), where he acquired mastering knowledge of Arabic, he emigrated to Lunel in Provence. One of his last, most mature works was the translation of Saadya’s \u003Cem>Beliefs and Convictions\u003C/em> (translated 1186). For more than eight centuries this work was studied by most Jewish scholars in Ibn Tibbon’s translation. Consequently the book has been preserved in many manuscripts. It was first printed in Istanbul (Constantinople, 1562), and then in numerous editions, none of them critical. This translation has gained additional importance after it had transpired that there are considerable differences between the two main manuscripts that had been the basis for the critical edition of the Arabic text (Mss Oxford and St. Petersburg), and that the Ibn Tibbon translation in most cases supported the St. Petersburg version. In spite of this fact both editors of the editions of the Arabic text preferred the Ms Oxford. Subsequent research has shown that numerous Genizah fragments as a rule support the St. Petersburg version. A critical edition of Ibn Tibbon’s translation has thus become a vital tool in establishing the text of the Arabic original, in addition to its being a scholarly desideratum in its own right for two main reasons: a) This is the text that was quite popular among Jewish readers for eight centuries who wanted to acquaint themselves with Saadya’a philosophy. b) It is one of a quite large number of texts that constituted the core of the canon of Jewish culture for centuries that as yet have not appeared in critical editions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>3) Henry Malter (1867-1925)\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nA native of Galicia, He pursued his higher education and his Jewish modern scholarly training in Germany, where he received his Ph.D. (Heidelberg 1894) and rabbinical diploma (Berlin Hochschule 1898). In 1900 he was appointed professor of medieval philosophy and Arabic at the Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati; later he moved to Dropsie College where he taught until his demise. Beginning in Germany, and later in America he was one of the most prolific scholars in Jewish studies at the time. The gem of his oeuvre was \u003Cem>Saadia Gaon; His Life and Works\u003C/em>, Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1921 (reprinted several times), which has remained the classic work on the subject. On p. 372 of this book Malter wrote in the course of his discussion of Ibn Tibbon’s translation: “A critical edition based on all the existing MSS, and on a careful comparison of the Arabic recensions, including the Genizah fragments, has been prepared by the present writer and will be published soon after the present work”. With Malter’s early demise the promised edition disappeared.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>4) The discovery of Malter’s lost work\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nSince I came first to CAJS as a Fellow during the 1994-95 academic year, I have tried to find traces of Malter’s edition which he promised in his book. Rumors had it at the time that it was somewhere in the basement of CAJS. All my inquiries during later years (when I returned in 2002 and 2007) with various members of the staff had not brought any results. In the spring of 2007 Dr. Arthur Kiron, the Curator of Penn’s Judaica collections, offered to help me find some uncataloged documents written by Solomon Skoss (a scholar of Judeo-Arabic who was one of the most prominent faculty of Dropsie College) that are kept in the archives of CAJS library. We went down to the archives for an extended period of time and searched through many documents but were unable to locate the particular Skoss writings we were looking for. But we did find two cardboard boxes with stickers on them saying “Malter Saadia”. On opening the boxes we found that they contained the lost draft of Malter’s critical edition of Saadya Gaon’s \u003Cem>Emunot ve-De`ot\u003C/em> and more.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>5) The Contents of the Malter Boxes\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Text of Judah Ibn Tibbon’s translation of Saadya Gaon’s \u003Cem>Emunot ve-De`ot\u003C/em>: 312 pages (in cardboard files) in Malter’s hand, accompanied by two apparati: a) Variant readings from MSS and early printed editions, referred to in the texts by Arabic numerals; b) Comparisons with the Judaeo-Arabic original, referred to in the text by Hebrew letters.

The close contact between ethnic groups, and especially that of Jews and Muslims, had a significant role in their acculturation. Ottoman Jews, and Ottoman Jewish society in the early modern period were greatly influenced by Ottoman culture in its broadest sense. The various manifestations of this acculturation are a main theme evidenced in a wide range of sources, such as congregational institutions, via material culture at the domestic sphere as in the synagogue, to folklore, social norms and mentality.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ms-philadelphia-halper-68\">Ms. Philadelphia, Halper 68\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Sagit Butbul\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4440_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>This manuscript contains a biblical glossary to I Kings in Judaeo-Arabic. This is but one of a group of glossaries, rather old, from the period before 1000 CE, in which the transliteration system is phonetic. J. Blau and S. Hopkins subsumed the spelling in these texts under the name “early phonetic Judaeo-Arabic spelling” (EPJAS). Biblical glossaries are lists of selected biblical words – usually, though by no means always, rare or difficult biblical words – and their renderings into Judaeo-Arabic. Sometimes writers of glossaries give not one meaning of a given word, but two and sometimes more; e.g. the biblical בירח (I Kings 6:37) in this glossary is translated as בשהר, בלהילל. We can see from this example several characteristics of early Judaeo-Arabic glossaries: the phonetic spelling (בשהר instead of the standardized JA spelling: באלשהר; בלהילל and not באלהלאל), the fact that a seemingly simple word (for speakers of modern Hebrew, at least) is given in this glossary, and that it receives not one, but two possible translations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In a recent article (“On Aramaic Vocabulary in Early Judaeo-Arabic Texts written in Phonetic Spelling”, JSAI 32 (2006), 433-471) J. Blau and S. Hopkins treat three biblical glossaries of eastern origin. One of these glossaries is this very glossary to I Kings. Some of the words which appear in these glossaries can attest to their eastern, namely Babylonian origin: Aramaic words from the spoken Aramaic vernacular, which are not attested in the Judaeo-Aramaic of the Talmud and Geonic literature, but are to be found in non-Jewish Eastern dialects, as Syriac and Mandaic; for example, the translation וככילונאת to the biblical ובלולים (I Kings 6:8; see Blau and Hopkins, p. 464.).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"time-myth-and-the-history-of-halakhah-in-the-late-gaonic-period\">Time, Myth and the History of Halakhah in the Late Gaonic Period\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Yossi David\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4825_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Our picture of the intellectual world of the tenth century Babylonian academies is far from being complete. However, due to the large quantity of Halakhic writings and their ambivalence approach toward non-legal aspects of the Talmud we tend to describe the Gaonic world as anti-mythic. Focusing on counter examples of such estimation offers a refreshing view on the Gaonic mythical consciousness and attitude toward Aggadic narratives. It is possible to trace back the apocalyptic theme mentioned in R. Sherira Gaon’s famous epistle and the meaning and uses of this theme in the construction of historical picture of the Halakhah. Exposed there are the theological connections of Gaonic world with early gnostic and apocalyptical traditions on the one hand and Islamic theological principles on the other. R. Sherira Gaon and his son R. Haya did elevate Adam’s figure to be the Father also draws their theological effort to reconstruct an entirely new concept of patriarchy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"hebrew-panegyric-jewish-court-culture-and-the-articulation-of-legitimacy\">Hebrew Panegyric, Jewish Court Culture, and the Articulation of Legitimacy\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jonathan Decter\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4690_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Hebrew poems in praise of men (panegyrics) were exchanged among Jewish intellectuals in the Islamic world from Iraq to al-Andalus and arguably constituted the most prevalent of medieval Hebrew secular genres. Scholars have dismissed panegyrics as unpalatable sycophancy anathema to modern literary tastes, which has resulted in the neglect of a rich source for studying the power structures of medieval Jewish societies and the ways in which political legitimacy was articulated and promulgated. Hebrew panegyrics are literary portraits that present constructions of Jewish power that were intimately bound to images of power in the contemporary Islamic milieu. Like the Arabic panegyrics offered to Caliphs and Muslim governors, Hebrew panegyrics praise addressees for their far-reaching reputations, their ability to render fair judgment, their noble lineage, their eloquence, their promotion of Jewish practice, and their efforts to thwart religious heretics. Panegyrics were not only shared among Jewish intellectuals belonging to a specific social network but also created a “virtual court culture” through the ritual exchange of texts over distances.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"mediterranean-jewish-merchants-and-the-conquests-of-the-normans\">Mediterranean Jewish Merchants and the Conquests of the Normans\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jessica Goldberg\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/religious-communities-islamic-empires/mediterranean-jewish-merchants?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4754_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/religious-communities-islamic-empires/mediterranean-jewish-merchants?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4779_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Letters among merchants make up one of the largest categories of documentary materials in the Cairo Geniza. Over 100 years of research by generations of scholars has shown that most letters come from groups of inter-connected merchants. Since some of these merchants wrote dozens of extant letters, and at least one received several hundred of them, many of these merchants’ names and lives are now known in a wealth of detail hitherto unprecedented for any “average” medieval person. Thanks to merchants’ descriptions of their activities, their goods, and their troubles, as well as their off-hand references to familial, communal, and political events, we have a unique window into the day-to-day workings of both the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean economies of the central Middle Ages.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Two documents in the Halper collection, Halper 389 and Halper 414, together form the longest extant mercantile letter in the Cairo Geniza. (Halper 414 is the small inserted second page, folded into the very long sheet that forms, as in most letters, both the writing surface and the wrapper of the letter). Not simply long, this letter, written around 1063 by the North African merchant Salama ibn Musa (Moses) the Sfaxi (from the town of Sfax), is one of the richest letters on political and military events. As he attempts to explain to his unhappy partner in Cairo why he has failed to do almost any productive business in the past year, Salama places the blame variously on movements and attacks by the Norman fleet against Sicily, small-scale warfare between the Sultan of North Africa and one of his wayward governors, payments to Bedouins for access to the olive groves of S. Tunisia, the difficulties of evading customs officers, and the machinations of jealous fellow merchants all over the central Mediterranean. Salama’s losses are our wealth: no letter in which business went well would ever tell us as much about how merchants tried to make a living.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-talkhīs-of-yusuf-b-nuh-and-abu-al-faraj-harun\">The \u003Cem>Talkhīs\u003C/em> of Yusuf b.

In order to effectively address such an audience, the exegete had to address these areas of knowledge and the assumptions that accompanied them. The Bible exegesis written in Arabic by Karaites and Rabbanites alike in the tenth and eleventh centuries exhibits this wide variety of subject matter, and reflects particularly strikingly the theological assumptions of the Jewish communities of the area, with their Mu’tazilite bent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This page is from the \u003Cem>Talkhīs\u003C/em> of the 10th century Karaites Yusuf b.

Canticles 1:14), the title page of which is pictured here, was published first in Eupatoria (Gözleve), 1836, with Caleb Afendopolo’s précis, Naḥal Eshkol (“The Stream of the Cluster”), which was composed in 1497. This book, written in 1148-1149, has a most peculiar style: 379 alphabets, starting alternately from beginning to end then end to beginning (alef to tav and tav to alef), and every stanza ends with the Hebrew letter khaf sofit (kha). The syntax and style make deciphering the book very difficult, but it is possible to understand the book with much effort. Eshkol ha-Kofer serves as a summa of Karaite Judaism as it had developed from the proto-Karaite Anan ben David to Hadassi himself. Both his legal determinations and his religious opinions seem to have their roots in his Karaite predecessors: Anan, Benjamin al-Nahawendi, Daniel al-Qūmisī, Ya‛qub al-Qirqisānī, Yefet ben Eli, Yūsuf al-Baṣīr (Joseph ha-Ro’eh), Yeshu‛a ben Judah, and others. It is no surprise, therefore, that most of Hadassi’s philosophical views are based on Islamic Kalām.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hadassi’s most notable innovation was his recording of ten principles of Judaism. Hadassi was one of the first Jews, Rabbanite or Karaite, to formulate a systematic and detailed list of dogmas, preceding, thereby, Maimonides. There is nothing particular new or surprising in the contents of his listed; Hadassi admits that he, himself, had taken the principles (ishurim in his terminology) from his predecessors. Nonetheless, the manner in which he arranged them was a novelty in Jewish thought. These principles are: 1) Existence of a Creator; 2) the Creator’s eternity and unity; 3) creation of the world; 4) the ministry of Moses and the other prophets; 5) the truth of the Torah; 6) the obligation to know Hebrew; 7) the Temple is the residence of God’s glory and in-dwelling; 8) resurrection of the dead; 9) accountability; and 10) reward and punishment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hadassi’s importance is as a transitional figure, who was the last representative of the classical Karaism of the Land of Israel Mourners, and the first representative of new Byzantine forms of the religion. Hence, although Hadassi was in the main still loyal to the traditional Karaite Kalāmic philosophy, written among Muslims mainly in Judaeo-Arabic, he did adumbrate the newly emerging Byzantine school of late medieval Karaite philosophy, of which the first known full adherent was Aaron ben Joseph, writing 150 years after Hadassi.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ancient-persian-status-symbols-adopted-by-the-arabs-after-the-conquest\">Ancient Persian status-symbols adopted by the Arabs after the Conquest\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Milka Levy-Rubin\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Levy-Rubin.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The conquest of the East by the Arabs, was followed by the adoption of many practices and customs of the conquered societies. Among these were Persian Royal manners and status symbols which were used in order to distinguish between the different classes in Persian society. Persian society was a rigid caste society going back to very ancient times. Status symbols included special dress items such as special head-gear, foot-gear, expensive robes made of special fabrics and decorated with embroidered edges, bejeweled belts and swords, and horses and their paraphernalia including saddles, reins, and other horse ornaments. All of these were privileges of the upper classes only. The lower classes were required to dress with humility.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Having gone through a period of acculturation, the Muslims adopted this concept of a class society and applied it to the new society which they were forging. In this new society, the Muslims represented the privileged upper class, with its codes of dress and behavior, while the non-Muslims were required to adopt the part of the restricted lower class and dress and behave with humility. This is clearly perceived in the legal document articulating the social status of the dhimmis or non-Muslims, shurut ‛Umar written in the eighth century. The dress prohibitions made on the non-Muslims in the shurut reflect dress customs of the Persian society, while the manners and customs demanded of them are actually part of the code of behavior in the presence of the king or other high officials in the royal court or outside it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The attached drawing found in the Scroll of Esther in the collection of the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, portrays Mordecai, who was accorded the special privilege of wearing a royal robe previously worn by the king, riding on a horse which had been ridden by the king, and paraded in the city square, led by Haman who proclaimed before him: “This is what is done for the man whom the king desires to honour” (Esther, 6:11). This ancient Persian royal custom, going back to very ancient times, was adopted by the Muslims. Upon their appointement, Muslims officials were given a prestigious horse and expensive robes, and their appointment was proclaimed when their horse was paraded in public. Non-Muslims were forbidden among other things, to use saddles or iron stirrups, and in many cases to ride horses altogether, as these were a clear symbol of nobility and therefore reserved for Muslims only.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"following-in-the-footsteps-of-rav-ḥai-gaons-lost-dictionary\">Following in the Footsteps of Rav Ḥai Gaon’s Lost Dictionary\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Aharon Maman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155304im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Maman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Rav Ḥai Gaon’s dictionary, Kitāb al-Ḥāwi, composed in the late 10th or early 11th century, was unfortunately lost by the end of the thirteenth century, and only small vestiges have survived in the Cairo Genizah. It was the only one in the history of Hebrew and Aramaic lexicography to be organized anagrammatically. Up to 1890 it was only known through old quotations in Jewish works, then when some twenty leaves were discovered in the St. Peterburg’s Genizah collections. A. E. Harkavy published a sample of one leaf. In 1976 S. Abramson published another two leaves. More Genizah material was discovered in Cambridge both in the Taylor-Schechter and the Westminster College collections, and one leaf at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. Recently I published a critical edition of ten leaves (see “The Remnants of R. Ḥai Gaon’s Dictionary Kitāb al-Ḥāwi in the Adler and Taylor-Schechter Geniza Collections”, Tarbiz 69 (2000), pp. 341-421 [in Hebrew]; preceded by “Ḥai Gaon’s Method in his Lexicon Kitāb al-Ḥāwi,” Studies in Ancient and Modern Hebrew in Honour of M.

Rav Ḥai Gaon quotes al-Khalil ibn Aḥmad’s Kitāb al-‛Ayn, the first dictionary ever composed by an Arab lexicographer (eighth century) and uses it for a better understanding of vague biblical words. Rav Ḥai’s openness to non-Jewish sources is also seen in his readiness to learn from the Christian tradition of the Catholicos of Baghdad to the understanding of a Psalm.

The miniature painting shows an amorous “picnic” with four figures arranged in two groups, two seated and two standing young men on a floral field against a beige background, with a bowl of fruits separating the groups. It is likely a homoerotic scene with three older men “courting” a younger man, a celebrated literary theme often depicted in Persian miniature paintings.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The second piece is a single leaf from a Persian manuscript from a popular collectionof tales about biblical and qur’anic prophets, involving here Daniel and Idrīs (Enoch), copied in excellent script on typical undyed oriental paper Its miniature is a highly animated scene of a polo match—the pastime par excellence of Persia and a common visual cliché of the Persianate tradition—depicting two horsemen who are chase the ball over a floral field, set against a light green background.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These miniatures are by the same, not wholly inexpert artist, and depict highly conventional (from the point of view of the tradition of Persian miniature paintings) scenes.

The circumstances of his life—exile, travels, and a forced conversion to Islam—gave Maimonides opportunities to encounter a particularly variegated list of political systems, cultural trends and systems of thoughts. His extraordinary personality and his insatiable intellectual curiosity drove him to make full use of these opportunities, integrating the various influences into his literary output.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Maimonides’ “Eight Chapters” are a short treatise on ethics, written as an Introduction to his Judeo-Arabic Commentary on tractate Avot .

Since the invention of moveable type in the fifteenth century, Jews as well as non-Jews have been engaged in the printing and sale of a surprisingly diverse array of editions of Judaica. This exhibition offers a small sampling of that vast panoply of creativity, based on the University of Pennsylvania’s distinguished library collections at the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies and at the Walter and Lenore Annenberg Rare Book and Manuscript Library. The materials selected highlight not only the production but also the consumption side of the business of the Jewish book: who bought and sold printed Judaica. In this exhibit, you will see in particular how these precious books came to be part of Penn’s library collections. Each item label explains from whom books were purchased or who donated specific treasures, and otherwise documents how Penn continues to develop one of world’s largest and most important Judaica collections.\n\nArthur Kiron\n\nArthur Kiron, exhibition curator; Andrea Gottschalk, exhibition designer.\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### Printer\n\nThe earliest printed books in the west, such as the Gutenberg Bible, were printed in Latin letters during the mid-15th century. By 1469, the first books printed in the Hebrew alphabet were issuing from Jewish-owned presses in Rome. Craftsmen and women -- among the first generation of Hebrew printers notably was a woman named Estellina Conat -- took pride and pleasure in what they called in Hebrew “a holy craft.” By the end of the era of incunabula (the years before 1501 known as the “cradle of printing”), approximately 140 books printed in Hebrew had appeared. Notably, when Jewish printers adopted this new technology of communication they did not limit their efforts to printing works of a strictly religious character. In addition to traditional Biblical, liturgical and talmudic texts and commentaries were philosophical and ethical treatises, legal codes, lexicographical tools, calendars and astronomical tables, illustrated fables, as well as works of grammar, rhetoric, history, and poetry. This taste for the humanities did not always meet with approval. A poetic narrative by Imanuel ben Solomon of Rome, for example, printed in the Italian city of Brescia by Solomon Soncino in 1490, subsequently was put under a ban by some rabbinic authorities for its erotic content. Twice printed by 1535, a new edition would not appear for another two hundred sixty years.\n\nThe first printing presses in any alphabet were established in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire by Jewish refugees from the Spanish Expulsion Decree of 1492. During the sixteenth century, as Jews fled across the Mediterranean in search of safe haven, some also took their Hebrew type with them. Though temporarily disrupted, the production and purchase of Hebrew books did not diminish. By the end of the 16th century, the number of Hebrew editions in circulation grew to nearly 2,700. At the same time, the first families of Jewish printers began to face stiff competition from large printing firms, some of the most famous of which, such as Bomberg, Bragadini, Giustiniani, and De Gara, were owned and controlled by Christians. Indeed, the market for Hebrew books was not restricted to Jewish readers but also attracted Christian scholars of Hebrew literature, or Christian Hebraists as they are called.\n\n#### **A. In the Cradle of Printing: Incunabula**\n\nThe business of early Hebrew printing was a family affair. Estellina Conat, Abraham’s wife, is the first woman known to have worked as a Hebrew printer. The beautiful, rounded Hebrew typography cut by Abraham Conat to print this work of Jewish philosophy was modeled on the letter shapes characteristic of Italian Jewish scribes.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160358im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/soncino-comp.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 1\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 1: The Soncino family was the most famous and prolific of all early Jewish printing families. This particular edition, a medieval ethical treatise, visually conveys the technological transition from manuscript to printed communication and the dispersion of Jewish printers during this era. The main text is printed by Joshua Soncino in unvocalized square Hebrew letters, while the commentary to the text is printed in semi-cursive letter shapes, based on a Sephardic scribal hand. The handwritten commentary, meanwhile, reflects a semi-cursive Italianate Hebrew (unidentified) scribal hand. Joshua Soncino was the first to print a Hebrew Bible with Masoretic vocalization and the first to print a tractate of the Talmud (_Berakhot_ or “Blessings”).\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160358im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/bj1287b43b44_1484_body0001.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 2\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 2: Though woodblock, rather than moveable type, found here are the earliest specimens of Hebrew type to appear in a Christian book printed in the era of incunabula.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160358im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/bt230_s393_1475.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 3\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 3: Though woodblock, rather than moveable type, found here are the earliest specimens of Hebrew type to appear in a Christian book printed in the era of incunabula.\n\n#### **B.

His editions of the Hebrew Bible with commentaries, liturgical works, and the Talmud, such as this rare printing of \"Talmud Bavli 'Avodah Zarah\" (the Babylonian Talmud tractate on idol worship), are prized for their high quality of paper, fine typography and distinctive glossed formatting which has been adopted and preserved by Jewish printers down to this day. Bomberg's edition of the Babylonian Talmud, forty-four tractates bound in twelve volumes and issued in Venice between 1520 and 1523, was the first complete set ever to appear in print. During the same period, his printing house also produced the first complete edition of the extant remains of the Talmud Yerushalmi (\"Jerusalem Talmud\").\n\n#### **C.

Each took up the philosopher Plato’s account of the death of Socrates and his arguments about the existence of an afterlife. This first edition of the Venetian rabbi Luzzatto, though less well-known than Mendelssohn’s work, is no less beautifully produced.

It was frequently reprinted and also translated into several languages, including Danish, Dutch, French, Italian and Russian.\n\n### Publisher\n\n“Publisher: a person or a company in business to issue for sale to the public through booksellers books, periodicals, music, maps, etc..” \n\n> As the business of the Jewish book evolved during the last five centuries, so did the role of the printer. Specialization gradually separated the craft of printing from the business of publishing. Vernacular publishing continued to widen the potential audience of readers of Jewish books beyond the limited constituencies of literate Jews and Christian scholars of Hebrew. Networks of commerce and communication, kinship and community emerged that bound together Jewish communities as well as non-Jewish readers from the Atlantic basin to the Indian Ocean. \n> \n> During the late eighteenth and nineteenth-centuries, the publisher-editor came to the fore with the rise of Jewish serial and subscription publishing. Atlantic port Jews began publishing English-language periodicals and books during the 1840s as a means to advance an enlightened, observant form of Judaism, identified in large part with Sephardic rather than Ashkenazic religious culture and history. By the mid-nineteenth century, the number of Jewish editions had grown into the tens and hundreds of thousands. At the same time, the world Jewish population surged for the first time into the millions. The number of documented subscribers just to books published in Hebrew is known to have been well over 350,000. Meanwhile, the potential reading public for Jewish books published in vernacular languages was enlarged by mass literacy, a consequence of public education and other kinds of enlightened reform programs.\n\n#### **A. The Beginnings of Serialized Jewish Publishing**\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160506im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/lampronti-comp.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 1\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 1: The physician and scholar Isaac Lampronti, the first “encyclopedist” of the Jewish people, is also noteworthy for having attempted to publish the first periodical in Hebrew, entitled _Reshit Bikure Katsir_. Lampronti’s idea was to provide a forum for discussion of Jewish legal and ritual questions. His serialized publication contained studies by his students at the Talmud Torah (a Jewish educational institution) in Ferrara. Due to controversies raised in its pages about the appropriateness of local customs connected with the priestly blessing, financial support was withdrawn and the periodical ceased publication after only three issues.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160506im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/pj5001m24_body0001.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 2\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 2: Among the beacons of Jewish enlightenment in late 18th century Germany, known today as the “Haskalah,” was _ha-Me’asef_ (“The Gleaner”), the earliest successful periodical published in Hebrew. Its publication was announced April 13, 1783 in a prospectus called Nahal ha-Besór. The editors and publishers, such as Isaac Euchel, Joel Loewe and Aaron Wolfssohn were _maskilim_, the intellectual exponents of the _Haskalah_. _Ha-Me’asef_ began publication in Koenigsberg in 1784 and then relocated to Berlin.\n\n#### **B. Enlightened Jewish Publishing in the early 19th century**\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160506im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/ap93s8_body0001.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 1\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 1: While the first _haskalah_ publications were printed in Hebrew characters, one of the distinctive features of nineteenth-century enlightened Jewish publishing was the employment of vernacular languages and alphabets. In Germany, the editors of _Sulamit_, David Fraenkel and Joseph Wolf, introduced German-language periodical publishing, printed in Gothic characters “for the advancement of Culture and Humanism among the Jewish Nation (“… zur Beförderung, der Kultur und Humanität unter den Israeliten.\").\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160506im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/bikure-anton-shmid-comp.jpg\" alt=\"fig 2.\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">fig. 2: By the 1820s, a new center of enlightened Jewish publishing was emerging in Vienna , the capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire, which included areas of Northern Italy and its Adriatic port cities, such as Trieste. Evidence of the hybrid and profitable nature of Jewish religious publishing during this time is the fact that Vienna’s most important printer-publisher of Jewish religious works, including prayer books, and the periodical _Bikure ha-itim_ (“The First Fruits of the Times”), was a Christian named Anton von Schmid.\n\n#### **C. Victorian Jewish Publishing in the Atlantic World**\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160506im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/ds135e5a265_1843_body0001.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 1\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 1: The _Voice of Jacob_ was the first Anglo-Jewish newspaper. Published in London , beginning on the eve of the Jewish New Year in 1841, its title undoubtedly refers to the first name of its principle editor, Jacob Franklin. The _Voice of Jacob_ was distributed across England; for example, in London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Cheltenham, Plymouth, Dover, Portsmouth, Canterbury, to Edinburgh, Scotland, to the West Indian islands of St. Thomas, Curacao, and Barbados, to the U.S. port cities of Charleston, South Carolina and Philadelphia, to Wellington, New Zealand, as well as to Corfu, Odessa, Paris, and Smyrna.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160506im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/occident-comp.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 2\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 2: Isaac Leeser is regarded as the most important Jewish publisher-editor in antebellum America. His _Occident_, published here in Philadelphia , was the first monthly Jewish periodical in the United States and the most successful of the three Atlantic Jewish periodicals displayed here. Leeser personally handled and/or supervised all aspects of the publication, including editing, advertising, and distribution. The printing of the periodical was carried out by C. Sherman, but Leeser himself sometimes set the type. Significantly, the _Occident_'s readership (like that of the _Voice of Jacob_ and the _First Fruits_) was not limited to Jews. Letters from Christian ministers often graced its pages.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160506im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/bikurei-moses-nathan-comp.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 3\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 3: The cover of this rare first issue features a bi-lingual title with the Hebrew left un-transliterated. The second word in the title phrase \\[“_Bikure ha-yam_”\\] or “first fruits of the sea” undoubtedly referred to their Caribbean-based newspaper, but the initial word “_bikure_” (first fruits \\[of\\]) perhaps also alludes to the enlightened Jewish journal _Bikure ha-‘itim_ published in Vienna from 1820-31. The editors’ decision to translate the word (_yam_) figuratively as “west” (like Leeser’s _Occident_) instead of literally as “sea” indicates that they conceived of their island press in the hemispheric context of the Atlantic littoral, and not in the local or regional terms of the Caribbean.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160506im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/leeser_b9f006_body0001.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 4\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 4: The Hebrew name (ha-Me’asef) of this weekly English-language Jewish periodical, the first of its kind to be published in the American Far West, echoes the title of the first _haskalah_ Hebrew periodical by the same (Hebrew) name. Eckman, an itinerant rabbi born in Prussian Posen had ministered to Jewish congregations in Richmond , VA , Charleston , SC , and Mobile , AL before settling in San Francisco. He served as the editor and publisher of the _Weekly Gleaner_, for which he solicits subscribers in this rare pre-publication circular.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160506im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/e184_5t78_1877_body0001.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 5\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 5: Featured in this famously illustrated (non-Jewish) monthly are depictions of scenes of Jewish rituals and festival customs. As with Bernard Picart’s 17th century engravings of Jewish ceremonies, this monthly issue is designed to appeal to non-Jewish audiences. Trumble tries here both to peak his American readership’s curiosity and to explain American Jewish life in a positive fashion to them once he has their attention.\n\n### Peddler\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160529im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/Bibliopola479.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 1\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160529im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/PJ5129_A2_Z75_1993.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 2\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe emergence of such a large market created new kinds of business for the Judaica book trade as a whole. Marketing books, through advertising, advanced subscriptions, through the mail, by cart, and on foot by peddlers and door-to-door salesmen, increased the circulation of books and periodicals. Rare books became sought after luxury goods and signs of refinement, in addition to sources of knowledge and information. Auction houses served as one of the means by which precious items, and entire libraries, would change hands. Book dealers became experts in their own right, not only of the market for such books and the prices people were willing to pay, but of the books themselves.\n\nBookseller catalogs, often replete with valuable descriptions explaining significance, condition, rarity, and price helped the novice and the expert alike navigate the specialized world of the Judaica book trade. Some booksellers took pride in producing catalogs with beautiful graphic designs. These sales catalogs did not merely list books for sale, but could be viewed as collector’s items in themselves. They combined scholarly descriptions of Judaica with a new-found aesthetic appreciation for the art as well as for the business of the Jewish book trade.\n\n#### **Section A.**\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160529im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/Abramovitsh-comp.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 1\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 1: Perhaps no literary figure came to occupy a more familiar place in the imagination of Ashkenazic Jewry in the second half of the 19th century then Mendele Mokher Sefarim or Mendele the Bookpeddler. Sh. Y. Abramovitsh, who is known by the name of his invented character Mendele, is considered one of the founders of modern Yiddish literature. The critic Dan Miron emphasizes that Mendele was not a pseudonym and not only a system of literary devices. The traveling bookpeddler symbolized the principle of freedom of the “insider-outsider” who was able to come and go as he pleased and for whom “traveling is a way of life.” The reality of life for itinerant peddlers however was far different. Surviving memoirs describe a life of loneliness, fear and uncertainty filled with obstacles and travails as peddlers moved from town to town trying to eke out a living.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160529im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/cajs_eph_14_body0001.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 2\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 2: This extremely scarce “Catalogo” of Jewish religious and Spanish language editions, reprinted in bibliophilic facsimile, is the earliest extant Judaica bookseller’s catalog. Notably, it was printed in Roman rather than Hebrew letters by the printing house of Menasseh ben Israel and is designed to appeal to Iberian Conversos who returned to Judaism. The prices are given in Dutch florins (the name of the currency officially changed to guilders after 1816).\n\n#### **Section B.**\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160529im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/ay891a46_1762_body0001.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 1\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 1: Almanacs were a popular and necessary guide for merchants traveling between different countries.

Ironically, those who would see the “people of the book” exclusively as creatures of the letter, rather than the spirit, failed to notice the exquisite artistic traditions physically recorded in Jewish books, including beautifully shaped Hebrew typography. From illuminated medieval manuscripts to illustrated printed books, Jewish book arts have featured and continue to offer the clearest visual evidence of Jewish artistic creativity. Needless to say, the most spectacular artistic works sold were sought after not only for their content but for their beauty. Today, a new kind of art-form, facsimile reproductions of unique works of Jewish book art, make it possible for many to see and study what would otherwise exist only in the hands of a few.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160553im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/haggadah-abraham-ben-jacob-comp.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 1\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 1: This edition of the Passover Haggadah, the rabbinic narration of the ancient Israelite Exodus from slavery in Egypt to freedom in the promised Land of Israel , was printed in Amsterdam in 1695.

In the twentieth-century, the Jewish book trade suffered the fate of being caught up in the horrors of two world wars. Already during the inter-war period of the 1920s many Hebrew and Yiddish authors, translators and publishers were forced to relocate, in part under the impact of inflation (which caused the reduction or out right loss of publishing subventions) from the major centers of Central and Eastern European Jewish publishing to Mandate Palestine and North America. Most of the population however did not leave in time, and by 1945 Jews would suffer catastrophic losses during the Holocaust. Despite the efforts to annihilate them, a remnant would survive to tell their stories in print through memoirs and memorial (yizkor) books. One of the most poignant symbols of their survival was the publication of a complete set of the Talmud printed in the American Occupation Zone in Munich in 1948. Printed on the reverse of the title page is the following dedication:\n\n> “This edition of the Talmud is dedicated to the United States Army. This army played a major role in the rescue of the Jewish people from total annihilation, and after the defeat of Hitler bore the major burden of sustaining the DPs \\[displaced persons\\] of the Jewish faith. This special edition of the Talmud published in the very land where, but a short time ago, everything Jewish and of Jewish inspiration was anathema, will remain a symbol of the indestructrability of the Torah. The Jewish DPs will never forget the generous impulses and the unprecedented humanitarianism of the American forces to whom they owe so much.”\n\n#### **Section A**\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160612im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/josephus-comp_0.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 1\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nfig. 1: The ownership markings on this edition of _The Jewish Wars_ by Josephus Flavius document the book’s fate from the 16th century, through the Holocaust, to the present day: \"Ex libris Joannis Christophori Freij Zellensis Auronianz\"; Library stamp from the “Nazi Reichsinstitut für Geschichte des n\\[?\\]lands Bibliothek”; bookplate of the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction; bookplate of the Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning; ownership stamp of the Annenberg Research Institute.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160612im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/Sefer-Yedvabneh-comp_1.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 2\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">fig. 2: In the aftermath of the Holocaust, survivors compiled historical documents, photographs, letters, and reminiscences about their destroyed Jewish communities to serve as commemorative memorial or “Yizkor” books.

Since the invention of moveable type in the fifteenth century, Jews as well as non-Jews have been engaged in the printing and sale of a surprisingly diverse array of editions of Judaica. This exhibition offers a small sampling of that vast panoply of creativity, based on the University of Pennsylvania’s distinguished library collections at the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies and at the Walter and Lenore Annenberg Rare Book and Manuscript Library. The materials selected highlight not only the production but also the consumption side of the business of the Jewish book: who bought and sold printed Judaica. In this exhibit, you will see in particular how these precious books came to be part of Penn’s library collections. Each item label explains from whom books were purchased or who donated specific treasures, and otherwise documents how Penn continues to develop one of world’s largest and most important Judaica collections.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Arthur Kiron\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Arthur Kiron, exhibition curator; Andrea Gottschalk, exhibition designer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"printer\">Printer\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The earliest printed books in the west, such as the Gutenberg Bible, were printed in Latin letters during the mid-15th century. By 1469, the first books printed in the Hebrew alphabet were issuing from Jewish-owned presses in Rome. Craftsmen and women — among the first generation of Hebrew printers notably was a woman named Estellina Conat — took pride and pleasure in what they called in Hebrew “a holy craft.” By the end of the era of incunabula (the years before 1501 known as the “cradle of printing”), approximately 140 books printed in Hebrew had appeared. Notably, when Jewish printers adopted this new technology of communication they did not limit their efforts to printing works of a strictly religious character. In addition to traditional Biblical, liturgical and talmudic texts and commentaries were philosophical and ethical treatises, legal codes, lexicographical tools, calendars and astronomical tables, illustrated fables, as well as works of grammar, rhetoric, history, and poetry. This taste for the humanities did not always meet with approval. A poetic narrative by Imanuel ben Solomon of Rome, for example, printed in the Italian city of Brescia by Solomon Soncino in 1490, subsequently was put under a ban by some rabbinic authorities for its erotic content. Twice printed by 1535, a new edition would not appear for another two hundred sixty years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first printing presses in any alphabet were established in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire by Jewish refugees from the Spanish Expulsion Decree of 1492. During the sixteenth century, as Jews fled across the Mediterranean in search of safe haven, some also took their Hebrew type with them. Though temporarily disrupted, the production and purchase of Hebrew books did not diminish. By the end of the 16th century, the number of Hebrew editions in circulation grew to nearly 2,700. At the same time, the first families of Jewish printers began to face stiff competition from large printing firms, some of the most famous of which, such as Bomberg, Bragadini, Giustiniani, and De Gara, were owned and controlled by Christians. Indeed, the market for Hebrew books was not restricted to Jewish readers but also attracted Christian scholars of Hebrew literature, or Christian Hebraists as they are called.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"a-in-the-cradle-of-printing-incunabula\">\u003Cstrong>A.

Estellina Conat, Abraham’s wife, is the first woman known to have worked as a Hebrew printer. The beautiful, rounded Hebrew typography cut by Abraham Conat to print this work of Jewish philosophy was modeled on the letter shapes characteristic of Italian Jewish scribes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901160358im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/soncino-comp.jpg\" alt=\"fig. 1\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>fig. 1: The Soncino family was the most famous and prolific of all early Jewish printing families.

The main text is printed by Joshua Soncino in unvocalized square Hebrew letters, while the commentary to the text is printed in semi-cursive letter shapes, based on a Sephardic scribal hand. The handwritten commentary, meanwhile, reflects a semi-cursive Italianate Hebrew (unidentified) scribal hand.

Bomberg’s edition of the Babylonian Talmud, forty-four tractates bound in twelve volumes and issued in Venice between 1520 and 1523, was the first complete set ever to appear in print.

Specialization gradually separated the craft of printing from the business of publishing. Vernacular publishing continued to widen the potential audience of readers of Jewish books beyond the limited constituencies of literate Jews and Christian scholars of Hebrew. Networks of commerce and communication, kinship and community emerged that bound together Jewish communities as well as non-Jewish readers from the Atlantic basin to the Indian Ocean. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>During the late eighteenth and nineteenth-centuries, the publisher-editor came to the fore with the rise of Jewish serial and subscription publishing. Atlantic port Jews began publishing English-language periodicals and books during the 1840s as a means to advance an enlightened, observant form of Judaism, identified in large part with Sephardic rather than Ashkenazic religious culture and history. By the mid-nineteenth century, the number of Jewish editions had grown into the tens and hundreds of thousands. At the same time, the world Jewish population surged for the first time into the millions. The number of documented subscribers just to books published in Hebrew is known to have been well over 350,000. Meanwhile, the potential reading public for Jewish books published in vernacular languages was enlarged by mass literacy, a consequence of public education and other kinds of enlightened reform programs.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"a-the-beginnings-of-serialized-jewish-publishing\">\u003Cstrong>A.

In the twentieth-century, the Jewish book trade suffered the fate of being caught up in the horrors of two world wars. Already during the inter-war period of the 1920s many Hebrew and Yiddish authors, translators and publishers were forced to relocate, in part under the impact of inflation (which caused the reduction or out right loss of publishing subventions) from the major centers of Central and Eastern European Jewish publishing to Mandate Palestine and North America. Most of the population however did not leave in time, and by 1945 Jews would suffer catastrophic losses during the Holocaust. Despite the efforts to annihilate them, a remnant would survive to tell their stories in print through memoirs and memorial (yizkor) books. One of the most poignant symbols of their survival was the publication of a complete set of the Talmud printed in the American Occupation Zone in Munich in 1948. Printed on the reverse of the title page is the following dedication:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“This edition of the Talmud is dedicated to the United States Army.

Both anecdotal and empirical evidence point quite decisively to the opposite conclusion. Indeed, religion appears to be more resurgent and present in the public square today than at any time in the modern age. And yet, to deny that religion has not been transformed by its encounter with the modern public sphere, state, and economic order would be foolhardy.\n\nThe Fellows of the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies during the 2009-10 year devoted themselves to studying the complex interplay and often permeable boundary between the religious and the secular in modern Jewish history. Projects ranged from excavating the hidden theological-political motifs of self-consciously secular texts to the attempted imposition of a secular agenda by the modern centralized state on the ironically modern (and arguably secular) phenomenon of Ultra-Orthodox Judaism. The combined effect of the Fellows' diverse and probing research projects was to introduce a new degree of theoretical and comparative sophistication to the idea (and practice) of the secular in the Jewish experience.\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### Joseph Ergas: _Sefer Shomer Emunim_, Amsterdam, 1737\n\nChristoph Schulte\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schulte1200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn the first half of the 18th century, the Tuscan port city of Livorno was a center of Jewish urban and intellectual life in the Mediterranean and had the largest Sefardi community in Europe, with Amsterdam second. Joseph Ergas (1685-1730), a descendant of a converso family, was an erudite, well known rabbi and kabbalist in Livorno. That's where he wrote his last book, the _Sefer Shomer Emunim_, a comprehensive description of Lurianic Kabbalah in a popular dialogical form. The book was edited by his sons and printed posthumously in 1737 in Amsterdam. The haskamah is signed by a number of other Livorno rabbis. Ergas' book is important for understanding the place of the doctrine of tsimtsum in European intellectual history, because Ergas submits one of the most refined arguments for a purely metaphorical understanding of the tsimtsum (the contraction of G''d before the creation of the world), as opposed to the literal reading of it by the disciples of Chajim Vital and by the sabbatianists.\n\nOf special interest is the engraved baroque title page of the _Sefer Shomer Emunim_ (i.e.\"Guardian of the Faithful\") which above the title of the book in the center shows Moses, _rabbenu hakadosh,_ with the tablets of the Law, indicating pious Torah observance, but surrounded by two baroque _putti,_ rather characteristic for catholic art. The engraving in the center under the title of the book depicts a male scholar teaching a group of men of mixed ages in a public square, showing a baroque church and palace in the background. Although the book was printed in Amsterdam, this allegory hints to Livorno or Italy (there were no such churches and palaces in Amsterdam), with Jews claiming and having their place in the public sphere in the early 18th century. Furthermore, this allegory can be interpreted as Kabbalah going exoteric, by public teaching and by print in a deliciously equipped book.\n\n### The Bible, Women and Secularism: Perspectives from London and Philadelphia\n\nAndrea Schatz\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schatz400_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nWhat would it mean for Jews to read the Bible in the political and cultural contexts of secularism? Among the first to raise this question were the maskilim and their conservative opponents in the 1780s. The controversy over Mendelssohn's edition of the Pentateuch unfolded against the background of Protestant and Orientalist attempts to define the Bible as an \"original\" document that could be dissociated from the tangled exegetical web of \"tradition\" and studied as the core text of a religion that was compatible with reason and secularism.\n\nMore than half a century later, the question of how modern Jews should read the Bible was still relevant. It received a new twist, when Grace Aguilar, the first successful Anglo-Jewish woman writer, and Isaac Leeser, renowned rabbi, editor and Bible translator in Philadelphia, addressed it on the pages of Aguilar's _The Spirit of Judaism_ (1842). Aguilar insisted on making the Bible universally accessible: it should be dissociated from the \"obscurities\" of tradition and disseminated among the entire \"Hebrew nation,\" including, emphatically, women and the poor. Leeser responded to this project with considerable anxiety. He supported Aguilar's inclusive definition of the Hebrew nation, but identified the Christian subtexts of a universalist approach that was predicated on the rejection of \"the trammels of tradition\": \"How else are we to read Scripture, unless it be in accordance with the views of our predecessors? What else forms the distinction between us and Christians?\" (100). Perhaps one of Aguilar's answers to these questions can be found in her use of Hebrew letters whenever she discusses the Shma’ Yisra’el: in Jewish contexts, the religious, national and universal meanings of the Bible and its language converge, rendering the text unique and clearly distinct from Christian, secular and cultural Bibles.\n\n### Civil Code and Halakha: The Question of Mixed Marriages between Christians and Jews\n\nEva Lezzi\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/lezzi-titlepage1200.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/civil-code-and-halakha-question-mixed?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/lezzi-68-69-1200.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/civil-code-and-halakha-question-mixed?item=1)\n\nThis book is an extraordinary and unique document that reveals the ways Prussia tried to prevent Christian-Jewish marriages on the basis of its Civil Code. In 1846 a Jewish doctor from Königsberg, Ferdinand Falkson, and his Protestant bride, Friederike Möller, were wedded in Hull, England, after they had unsuccessfully attempted to marry in Königsberg without one partner's converting. Back in Königsberg the couple was sued by a court, which finally declared their marriage as \"nichtig\" \\[invalid\\] and sentenced the couple to pay for the costs of the process. Falkson himself published in 1845 and 1847 a collection of papers of importance to their case under the title Gemischte Ehen zwischen Juden und Christen. Dokumente \\[Mixed Marriages between Jews and Christians. Documents\\].\n\nThe legal aspects of the question whether Christian-Jewish marriage was at all possible were determined by the _Allgemeines Landrecht fC_ \\[General Laws for the Prussian States—ALR\\] from 1794. The ALR states that a \"Christian cannot enter into marriage with such persons who, according to the tenets of their religion, are hindered from subjecting themselves to the Christian laws of marriage\" (ALR, II.1, section one, §36).\n\nFalkson's small book shows the different and contradictory arguments about the commensurability of Christian and Jewish marriage laws, ceremonies and contents. While the state attorney did not hesitate to quote antisemitic sources, such as Eisenmenger's _Entdecktes Judentum_ \\[Judaism Unmasked\\], to prove the incommensurability, the Jewish authorities were divided. In his radical reform position Rabbi Samuel Holdheim saw no obstacle against Christian-Jewish marriages.\n\nThe conservative Rabbi Jacob Oettinger, on the other hand, declared Christian-Jewish marriages as invalid according to the Bible. At the same time, he tried to prove that marriage according to Judaism fulfils the same bourgeois moral values as according to Christianity. The pages scanned for the exhibition show a part of the expert report that Oettinger was asked to submit to court.\n\n### Apologetics in an Age of Secular-Catholic Conflicts\n\nAri Joskowicz\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/joskowicz600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nLion Wolff, _Handel, Schacher und Wucher der Juden im Kalender für Zeit und Ewigkeit von Alban Stolz: ein Wort der Verwahrung und zur Abwehr_ (Karlsruhe: Macklot, 1874).\n\nIn many respects, Lion Wolff's small pamphlet can be read as a typical apologetic piece of the nineteenth century. Wolff was a Jewish teacher in a small village in a predominantly Catholic part of Baden (Germany), who reacted to an antisemitic treatise that was highly successful in his environment: Alban Stolz's _Kalender für Zeit und Ewigkeit._ In this calendar for the Catholic population, Stolz had attacked Jews as enemies of the simple farmer, as treacherous petty merchants, and usurers. Following the example of earlier apologetic pieces against antisemites, Wolff was not merely defensive but sought to write a sharp, witty, and popular rebuttal.\n\nWhat did it mean to write poignant apologetics? It implied that one could draw on a generally intelligible language to discredit one's enemy, and no language was as effective during this period as anti-Catholicism. Starting with conflicts in the 1840s and peaking during the so-called _Kulturkampf_ of the 1870s, anti-Catholicism had become an identifying marker of liberal patriotism in Germany. At the time that Wolff wrote his pamphlet, debates on the compatibility of particular religions with good citizenship had focused not on Jews but on Catholics, and Wolff was skillful at exploiting this fact.\n\nWolff, for example, countered the claim that Jews were taking advantage of the drinking habits of the peasantry with the following argument: The peasants' tendency to get inebriated with brandy was in truth the result of the Catholic clergy's pernicious activities. The priests preached the dogma of papal infallibility to women, who naturally accepted it. They then went home and demanded of their husbands that they follow them in this belief—something the men refused to do. Irritated by the domestic strife that ensued, these Catholic husbands spent their nights in the pub, drinking to forget.\n\nAs in other cases we should not read this anti-Catholicism purely as a strategy. It was rather an attempt to defend the Jews with stereotypes that the author might have well internalized. Nor did Wolff rely only on anti-Catholicism; much of the pamphlet is involved in a more traditional attempt to discredit the various accusations Stolz had made against the Jews. Wolff's success—his pamphlet was published in three editions within several months—was nevertheless difficult to imagine without the references to particular popular themes of the anti-Catholic _Kulturkampf._ _Handel, Schacher und Wucher_ is remarkable because it reminds us how much Jewish apologetics were shaped by the intensive conflicts between liberal secularists and Catholics.\n\n### The First Hebrew Translation of Spinoza's Ethics\n\nDaniel Schwartz\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/SpinozaHebrew600.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/first-hebrew-translation-spinozas-ethics?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/SpinozaItalian6001.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/first-hebrew-translation-spinozas-ethics?item=1)\n\nB. d. Spinoza, _Heker ’Elohah ‘im torat ha-’adam_ \\[An Investigation of God with the Science of Man\\], translated by S. Rubin (Vienna: G. Brag, 1885).\n\nThe Dutch philosopher of Portuguese Jewish origin Baruch (or Benedictus) Spinoza (1632-1677) has undergone something of a renaissance in the last decades. The current revival is as striking for the variety of fields and genres represented as for its essentially similar bottom line: the idea of the rationalist thinker, pioneering biblical critic, and legendary conflater of God and Nature, as an originator of philosophical modernity, or perhaps we should say modernities, given the diverse and often contradictory intellectual legacies from the seventeenth century onward laid at his doorstep. One such legacy, Jonathan Israel has famously argued, was the so-called \"Radical Enlightenment,\" which was distinguished from the moderate mainstream within the larger Enlightenment movement by its revolutionary esprit, its refusal to accommodate itself to religion, tradition, and the past, and its open commitment to the modern and secular as such. \"Spinoza and Spinozism,\" Israel argues, were the \" intellectual backbone of the European Radical Enlightenment everywhere, not only in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, and Scandinavia but also Britain and Ireland.\"\n\nAnd, we might add, in Jewish East Central Europe. Excommunicated by the Sephardic Jews of Amsterdam in 1656 for his \"horrible heresies\" and \"monstrous deeds,\" Spinoza would remain a persona non grata in Judaism for nearly two centuries thereafter. Yet in the 1840s and 1850s, the Haskalah—which had migrated from Berlin to Austrian Galicia and the Russian Empire earlier in the nineteenth century—became increasingly polarized between moderates committed to keeping the Jewish Enlightenment moored in rabbinic law and culture and militants intent on a no-holds-barred critique of tradition. These radical _maskilim_—like the European radical enlighteners of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries—turned to Spinoza and his ideas for inspiration and guidance. It was in this moment and milieu that the Amsterdam philosopher emerged, in the words of Y.H. Yerushalmi, as \"the first great culture-hero of modern, secular Jews.\"\n\nBy far, the most zealous champion of Spinoza in the campaign to reclaim him for Hebrew literature and culture was Salomon Rubin (1823-1910), a Hebraist _maskil_ from Galicia. In 1856, Rubin wrote _Moreh nevukhim he-hadash, or The New Guide to the Perplexed_, his first of what would be many works over the next fifty years of his life dedicated to Spinoza. This was a two-volume apologia for an audacious venture—a proposal to translate Spinoza's two most notable works, the _Ethics_ (1677) and the _Theological-Political Treatise_ (1677), into Hebrew. Yet the justification for this scheme was in fact already inherent in Rubin's title, which framed Spinoza as the second coming of Maimonides.\n\nNearly thirty years later, in 1885, Rubin finally came out with his long awaited translation of the Ethics. (He never finished translating the _Theological-Political Treatise_, which would have to wait until 1961 for a complete Hebrew rendering.) The Hebrew name he gave his translation, however, was not the literal Hebrew equivalent for the _Ethics of Sefer ha-middot_ (as Jacob Klatzkin would later title his 1924 translation) but rather _Heker ’Elohah ‘im torat ha-’adam_, or An Investigation of God with the Science of Man. The change was significant. Rubin's Spinoza was no atheist. His system—for all its trailblazing character in philosophy and science and its rejection of religious orthodoxy—was thoroughly \"God-intoxicated.\" Its concept of divinity, moreover, had ample precedent within medieval Jewish philosophical and mystical literature; what Spinoza had done, in essence, was to transpose a hidden history of Jewish pantheism into the clear and distinct idiom of rationalism. All this led Rubin to conclude that \"Spinozism was Jewish from beginning to end.\"\n\nRubin's translation of the Ethics is today reduced to a footnote of Jewish history and Hebrew literature. Though it played an important role in introducing many fin-de-siC(cle Hebrew rebels to Spinoza—including David Ben-Gurion (1886-1973) and Mikhah Yosef Berdichevsky (1865-1921)—it has long since been surpassed by Klatzkin's version, which even with subsequent translations remains the standard-bearer. Yet Rubin's _Investigation of Godstill_ has much to tell us about the resonance of Spinoza in Jewish formations of the secular. The Radical Enlightenment celebrated Spinoza as a nonbeliever, revolutionary, and cosmopolitan. The _maskilim_ in the Jewish version of Radical Enlightenment also heralded the Amsterdam heretic as a symbol of modernity. Yet they appropriated him somewhat differently: as a pantheist and even panentheist rather than atheist, as a revealer of the secrets of the Jewish past rather than a proponent of total rupture from tradition, and as a \"Jewish\" rather than strictly universal thinker and hero.\n\n### _Milhemet mitsvah (Commanded War)_. Sighet, 1888\n\nDavid Myers\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/myers600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nDisplayed here is the title page of a book of rabbinic opinions, Milhemet mitsvah, published in Sighet, Hungary (later Romania) in 1888. The book emerges out of the intense and contentious religious environment of the Hungarian Unterland, a region of Northern Transylvania that served as the incubator for a new current of Orthodox Jewry that came to be known as _haredi_ and was fiercely resistant to \"modernizers\" of any sort. The book's title, \"Commanded War,\" reflects the pervasive sense of peril and need for battle of the \"Kehal ha-Ortodoksen\" (the \"Orthodox Community\" in Sighet), which was summoned to resist \"those who would rise up to destroy and deny all the regulations\"—in this case, another group of observant Jews who established their own community several years earlier.\n\nThe top portion of the left page is an opinion issued by the late R. Yekutiel Yehudah Teitelbaum (1808-1883), known as the Yetev Lev, enjoining all Jews from eating meat slaughtered under the supervision of the less stringently observant Status Quo community. The Yetev Lev was the grandfather of R. Joel Teitelbaum (1887-1979), the founding rabbi of the Satmar Hasidic movement.\n\n### Traveling in the Holy Land through the Stereoscope\n\nIlana Pardes\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/StereoscopeEasterProcessionHolySepulchre1200.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/traveling-holy-land-through-stereoscope?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/StereoscopeMapJerusalem600_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/traveling-holy-land-through-stereoscope?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/StereoscopeTitlePage600_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/traveling-holy-land-through-stereoscope?item=2)\n\nUnderwood and Underwood's _Traveling in the Holy Land through the Stereoscope_ (New York and London, 1900) is one of the most ingenious series of Holy Land stereographic tour guides.\n\nThe three-dimensional effect of the stereoscope promised viewers an authentic tour of the holy sites in their very home. Instead of traveling to the Holy Land, they could now visit the Mount of Olives or the Holy Sepulchre with the stereoscope as their \"personal\" guide.\n\nThe ability of stereographs to represent biblical geography with a new sense of space and depth was construed as a new way of approaching scripture, far more compatible with modern sensibilities.\n\n### Jerusalem - Historical or Sacred?\n\nJonathan Gribetz\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/gribetz1200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe city of Jerusalem stubbornly defies conventional binaries and as an always-extreme case study highlights the problems and deficiencies inherent in standard modes of categorization. This is certainly so as regards 'secularism' and the division between 'religious' and 'secular.' A city of great religious significance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, Jerusalem at the same time became the symbol for nationalisms that defined themselves as definitively secular. In the Late Ottoman period—captured here in a photograph of the Jaffa Gate to the Old City of Jerusalem, ca. 1900 (from the Lenkin Family Collection at CAJSL)—Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived together and interacted with one another on a daily basis, though there was a sense, at least among intellectuals, that tensions were rising.\n\nIf these were purely 'secular' tensions of modern nationalisms, the language of the encounter maintained a distinctly religious tone. \"I had experience with many dragomans during my sojourn in the East,\" writes Albert Payson Terhune in Syria from the Saddle (1897), and nearly all were \"phonographic machines (frequently out of order) with truly civilized proficiency in the arts of laziness and petty theft.\" Two of the exceptions were the Christian men whose services were advertised on the wall of the Jaffa Gate plaza in this photograph: \"Demitrius Domian of Jerusalem, and—head and shoulders above all others—David Jamal.\" What distinguished Jamal, according to Terhune, was his thorough knowledge of the Bible \"in connection with the geography of his own country.\" Jamal \"not only familiarized himself with every mile of ground, but learned every historical or sacred episode connected with it.\" 'Historical or sacred,' Jerusalem's complexities and contradictions persist.\n\n### Zionist Images & Ancient Revivals in the Secular National Hebrew Culture\n\nYael Zerubavel\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/zarubavel1329.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/zionist-images-ancient-revivals-secular?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/zarubavel2888.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/zionist-images-ancient-revivals-secular?item=1)\n\nThis segment of a studio image of the clandestine group _Hashomer_ \\[The Guard, (above left)\\] highlights the duality of secularizing orientations among European Zionist \"olim\" \\[new immigrants\\] in Palestine at the beginning of the twentieth century: The transformation of the traditional \"exilic Jew\" into a modern European followed the ideas of the Jewish Enlightenment, and is represented by Israel Schohat on the right; and the transformation of the European Jew into a native of the Middle East and the Land of Israel is represented by his friend, Menachem Portugali, on the left. _Hashomer_'s hybrid clothes represented the desire to reconnect with the ancient Hebrew identity by borrowing clothes items from the neighboring Arabs and by imitating them.\n\nDance performances drawing on biblical images provided another creative venue for displaying the symbolic continuity between the ancient and the modern Hebrew identity (below left). Interpreting the Bible as the foundation of the national canon of Jewish texts, it inspired members of the Zionist Jewish society in Palestine to connect with their national past and to embrace ancient forms as part of the renewal of the Hebrew culture.\n\n### The Jewish Public Sphere in Fin de Siècle Warsaw\n\nScott Ury\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/uryFolkslider1600.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/jewish-public-sphere-fin-de-siecle-warsaw?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/uryint600.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/jewish-public-sphere-fin-de-siecle-warsaw?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-11/urymz600.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/jewish-public-sphere-fin-de-siecle-warsaw?item=2)\n\nThe rapid growth of Warsaw in the second half of the nineteenth century and a series of new government regulations produced an array of cultural and political activities for many of the city's 300,000 Jewish residents in the early twentieth-century. While many of these modernizing projects advocated secular platforms, many of them were also imbued with key aspects of traditional Jewish society, culture and religion.\n\nOne of the more prominent figures in the new Jewish cultural sphere was the journalist, folklorist, and political leader Noah Prylucki. In addition to publishing the immensely popular Warsaw Yiddish dailies _Der veg_ and later _Der moment_, Prylucki was repeatedly drawn to \"the people.\" As part of his interest in \"the Jewish folk,\" Prylucki headed a folklore and ethnographic group in Warsaw. The group's activities led to the publication of the two-volume collection _Yiddish Folk Songs_, the first of which was dedicated to \"Religious and Holiday Songs\" (Figure #1, Prylucki's _Yidishe folkslider_, volume 1).\n\nThis tension between a secularizing agenda and the very folk that these projects were determined to rehabilitate was one of the central themes of the Yiddish play, Der inteligent (The Intellectual) which was written by Peretz Hirschbein and published in Warsaw in 1907. Like other members of the Jewish intelligentsia, Hirschbein enjoyed many aspects of the new Jewish culture—like Yiddish theater—and was simultaneously attracted to parts of traditional Jewish society. Hirschbein would later describe the central theme of Der inteligent as: \"The inner tragedy of an intellectual who did not win the trust of the masses, and for whom the psychology of the simple worker was truly foreign\" (Fig. #2, Der inteligent).\n\nYehezkel Kotik was another Jewish resident of Warsaw who found himself drawn to the modern city while yearning for more traditional communities. Kotik, who vividly recalled his experiences in his memoirs _Mayne zikhroynes_, ran a coffee house in the heart of Warsaw's Jewish neighborhood. Like the Jewish newspaper and the Yiddish theater, Kotik's coffee house provided a new, ostensibly secular space where Jewish urbanites could partake in new cultural activities while still maintaining many traditional modes of socialization, interaction and culture (Figure #3, cover page of _Mayne zikhroynes_).\n\nThus, while all three cases—Prilutski's newspaper, Hirschbein's theater and Kotik's café—were distinctly secular institutions that helped form the Jewish public sphere, all three projects were also deeply imbued with the spirit, culture and language of traditional Jewish society.\n\n### Gershom Scholem, The German Translation of Sefer Ha-Bahir (Berlin: Schocken Verlag, 1933)\n\nGalili Shahar\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/shahar600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe image shown here reproduces the title page of the 1933 edition of Gershom Scholem's translation of and commentary on _Sefer Ha-Bahir_—the oldest book of Jewish Kabbalah in Europe. Scholem's translation, which was submitted as part of his Ph.D. project to the University of Berlin, was first published in 1923. Scholem's translation was not only a milestone in his early career as a Kabbalah researcher, but also marked the beginning of a new field of research in Jewish Studies. However, the translation of _Sefer Ha-Bahir_ into German carries additional implications: it marks the \"return of the sacred\" and the dialectic of secularism in German-Jewish modernism. Scholem's translation, besides its academic significance, hints also at the paradox of the German-Jewish \"dialogue\"—namely, the acknowledgment of the ambivalent aspects of Jewish being and creation in German culture. Efforts by Jews to engage in this dialogue were significant and essentially productive and original, but also became associated with self-denial, anti-Semitic rejection and finally with political violence. Scholem himself later argued against these efforts. The date and the place of this later publication of Scholem's translation by Schocken Verlag—Berlin/1933, the same year and place that Hitler came to power—mark the impossibility, the uncanny prospect of the German-Jewish cultural project, the modernist creation of German Jews in the fields of philosophy, art, literature and politics, which carries the signature of progress and horror.\n\n### Emmanuel Levinas, Carnets de captivité, suivis de Ecrits sur la captivité, et Notes philosophiques diverses (Paris: Editions Grasset/IMEC, 2009)\n\nAnnette Aronowicz\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aronowicz1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis is the first in a series of three volumes intended to make available Levinas's unpublished writings. As its title indicates, the bulk of its contents are the notes Levinas kept while a prisoner in a German forced labor camp from 1940-1945. He was captured as a soldier in the French army and, since the Germans abided by the Geneva conventions with those countries that were signatories, he was not sent to a death camp. The Jewish soldiers were separated from the rest of the French prisoners but suffered more or less the same harsh treatment as they did. As he was often to put it, the French uniform saved his life.\n\nIt is clear from the content of this book that he had access to a library and to at least some paper and writing implements while incarcerated. Although he worked cutting wood from morning until night, he still had some moments of leisure. The notes we find here are often very short, a sentence, a paragraph, quotations copied whole from whatever he was reading. Very little of it is about the daily life in the camp. His thoughts seem either to grapple with long standing philosophical questions or with literary topoi. This is not to say they had nothing to do with the war experience but their connection to it is not made explicit in most cases.\n\nThe excellent scholarly introduction to this volume, by Rodolphe Colin and Catherine Chalier, provides guidance into the central themes. In many respects,though, Levinas's own jottings are useful primarily to people who are already familiar with his thought. It is surprising to notice both ideas and language that occur much later in his work. It is also surprising to see the extent of his literary interest, and, sometimes, in figures one would not think would draw his attention, like the Catholic writers Leon Bloy and Georges Benanos, whose work expressed a peculiar and highly suspect attitude toward Jews, which Levinas ignores in favor of some other aspect of their thought. It is also highly instructive to see how Levinas addresses Judaism in the period before he was introduced to Talmudic studies.\n\nThe sections following the war writings proper (as a matter of fact, the jottings date from before the war—1937—and conclude after the war—1950.) are more of a piece. The first is a series of short essays that he wrote in 1945-1946, describing the Jewish experience of captivity, meant for a Jewish audience, with the addition of a short reflection about the philosopher Bergson's death. The last section consists of philosophical musings of greater breadth, some of which are a rough draft for what will be his first philosophical publication after the war, De l'existence a l'existant (1947).\n\nSince much of what appears in this volume had been originally handwritten on bad quality paper, and in pencil to boot, and preserved for an average of sixty-five years, the editors had to fill in some letters and hunt down many references. Their scholarly reconstruction is indicated both in footnotes marking the changes they introduce to the text and in endnotes in which the bibliographical and historical material they unearthed is made available.\n\n### Dialectics of modern Jewish Aesthetics: Secular Music and Sacred Sources\n\nMichal Ben-Horin\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/benhorin600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn an essay on Arnold Schoenberg, Theodor W. Adorno called the German Jewish composer 'Musikant,' thus alluding to traditions of Jewish music mainly known in Eastern Europe. The difference between 'Musikant' and 'Musiker' that echoes with Adorno's linguist decision, reveals a fascinating correspondence and a whole set of tensions—and transformations—between the sacred and the secular, the modern and the ancient, invention and tradition, innovation and repetition. This is demonstrated in a work by Marc Chagall, who shaped the image of the ancient musician, King David, according to the model of an Eastern European Musikant. Chagall's work serves as the cover of _Anthology of Jewish Music: Sacred and Volk Songs of the East European Jews_, edited by N. Vinaver (New York, E. B. Marks 1955) that includes Schoenberg's \"Psalm 130 for Mixed Chorus,\" op. 50B. The cover image reproduced here comes from a copy in the collection of the Library of the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies.\n\nCareful study of Arnold Schoenberg's opera _Moses und Aron_ reveals how modernist techniques of the New Music translated, re-defined, and gave a radical interpretation to concepts and ideas from the realm of Jewish tradition such as prophecy, revelation, the Mosaic Law, and prayer. When we look at how religious figures are transformed into art, and particularly how the question of monotheism and the image prohibition (i.e., the law that prohibits the making of the image of God) is elaborated in innovative musical textures, it becomes evident that Jewish secularism is not merely a process of \"overcoming religion,\" but rather a complex transformation of theological elements and traditions into new and ambiguous forms of aesthetic representation.\n\nAlso translated and employed in the realm of secular poetics is the configuration of the violin in modern Jewish and Hebrew literature. The secular adaptations of musical images are embedded in religious traditions and loaded with biblical connotations which generate contradictory categories: lamentation which resonates with a promise of redemption, destruction that reverberates with national revival, exile that echoes with the homeland. Transformed into modernist and contemporary works of literature, they play a role in the poetic rebirth of a Zionist body, the narration of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the shape of a memory poetics after the holocaust. We see, thus, how the violin becomes a medium of identification and negation, imagination and documentation within which old and new identities are revealed, but also challenged. This transformation of musical figures exposes, however, the dissonances of secularism—namely, the dialectic relationship and tensions, the discontents and limits of secular cultures.\n\n### Religious Relations in a Secular State: Jews and Muslims in France, circa 1968\n\nEthan Katz\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/katz600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nFor two days in early June 1968, rioting erupted between Jews and Muslims living in Belleville, a diverse immigrant neighborhood in Paris. The riots began with a disputed card game between a Jew and a Muslim, an illustration of the generally peaceful daily co-existence of the two groups in the neighborhood. Indeed, the large, mostly Tunisian Jewish and the sizable, mostly Algerian Muslim populations of Belleville had long lived in inter-ethnic harmony. Hallal and kosher restaurants and butcheries existed side-by-side, and Jews and Muslims often felt a shared sense of Maghrebian culture, sometimes exchanging pastries around each others' holidays or life cycle events, as they had in North Africa. In these daily interactions, one can detect two forces, at once competing and complementary. The first is the tradition of secular French republican nationalism that privileged public unity and confined ethnic or religious identities to the private sphere. The second is Jewish and Muslim traditions from North Africa, wherein harmonious coexistence depended on related and often shared ethnic and religious traditions that did not start and stop at the door of one's home or place of worship.\n\nThe riots, soon linked by commentators and community members to their coincidence with the first anniversary of Israel's victory in the Six Day War, illustrated the at once explosive and harmonious potential of such a mixture. On the one hand, violence between neighbors, whose real roots lie, in significant part, in social and economic discontent, quickly gave way to a battle framed both by participants and by the media as inter-ethnic and inter-religious. Such a framework violated the terms of the secular republican pact through the simultaneous self-identification and stigmatization of individuals and groups based not on relationship to the French state, but rather on those to transnational or religious communities. On the other hand, attempts by leaders to quell the riot took two forms: a verbal insistence on the shared responsibilities of Jews and Muslims as neighbors and fellow residents of France; and a public demonstration by a pair of important Jewish and Muslim figures of inter-personal warmth and calm, as models for their communities.\n\nThe latter gesture, captured in this photograph of Belleville Rabbi Emmanuel Chouchena, originally from Algeria, and Tunisian ambassador Mohamed Masmoudi, played a key role in restoring Belleville and its inter-ethnic relations to normal. The leaders' action at once insisted on the need to uphold publicly secular French identity, and reflected a more complex reality in which minority ethnic and religious groups were becoming increasingly visible in their culture and politics. Indeed, this moment, a signal one in post-colonial France, revealed the very tensions -- between the insistently unified and secular nature of French nationalism, and assertive ethnic and religious group identities -- that continue to plague the Fifth Republic today.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Aronowicz, Annette.** _Jews and Christians on time and eternity : Charles Péguy’s portrait of Bernard-Lazare._ (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998)\n    \n*   **Asad, Talal.** _Genealogies of religion : discipline and reasons of power in Christianity and Islam Baltimore._ (Johns Hopkins University Press, c1993)\n    \n*   **idem.** _Formations of the secular : Christianity, Islam, modernity._ (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2003)\n    \n*   **Ben-Horin, Michal.** \"Memory Metonymies’: Music and Photography in Ingeborg Bachmann and Monika Maron,\" in German Life and Letters (59.2 (2006), 233-248).\n    \n*   **Blumenberg, Hans.** _The legitimacy of the modern age.,_ translated by Robert M.

Both anecdotal and empirical evidence point quite decisively to the opposite conclusion. Indeed, religion appears to be more resurgent and present in the public square today than at any time in the modern age. And yet, to deny that religion has not been transformed by its encounter with the modern public sphere, state, and economic order would be foolhardy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Fellows of the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies during the 2009-10 year devoted themselves to studying the complex interplay and often permeable boundary between the religious and the secular in modern Jewish history. Projects ranged from excavating the hidden theological-political motifs of self-consciously secular texts to the attempted imposition of a secular agenda by the modern centralized state on the ironically modern (and arguably secular) phenomenon of Ultra-Orthodox Judaism. The combined effect of the Fellows’ diverse and probing research projects was to introduce a new degree of theoretical and comparative sophistication to the idea (and practice) of the secular in the Jewish experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"joseph-ergas-sefer-shomer-emunim-amsterdam-1737\">Joseph Ergas: \u003Cem>Sefer Shomer Emunim\u003C/em>, Amsterdam, 1737\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Christoph Schulte\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schulte1200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>In the first half of the 18th century, the Tuscan port city of Livorno was a center of Jewish urban and intellectual life in the Mediterranean and had the largest Sefardi community in Europe, with Amsterdam second. Joseph Ergas (1685-1730), a descendant of a converso family, was an erudite, well known rabbi and kabbalist in Livorno. That’s where he wrote his last book, the \u003Cem>Sefer Shomer Emunim\u003C/em>, a comprehensive description of Lurianic Kabbalah in a popular dialogical form. The book was edited by his sons and printed posthumously in 1737 in Amsterdam. The haskamah is signed by a number of other Livorno rabbis. Ergas’ book is important for understanding the place of the doctrine of tsimtsum in European intellectual history, because Ergas submits one of the most refined arguments for a purely metaphorical understanding of the tsimtsum (the contraction of G”d before the creation of the world), as opposed to the literal reading of it by the disciples of Chajim Vital and by the sabbatianists.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of special interest is the engraved baroque title page of the \u003Cem>Sefer Shomer Emunim\u003C/em> (i.e.”Guardian of the Faithful”) which above the title of the book in the center shows Moses, \u003Cem>rabbenu hakadosh,\u003C/em> with the tablets of the Law, indicating pious Torah observance, but surrounded by two baroque \u003Cem>putti,\u003C/em> rather characteristic for catholic art. The engraving in the center under the title of the book depicts a male scholar teaching a group of men of mixed ages in a public square, showing a baroque church and palace in the background. Although the book was printed in Amsterdam, this allegory hints to Livorno or Italy (there were no such churches and palaces in Amsterdam), with Jews claiming and having their place in the public sphere in the early 18th century. Furthermore, this allegory can be interpreted as Kabbalah going exoteric, by public teaching and by print in a deliciously equipped book.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-bible-women-and-secularism-perspectives-from-london-and-philadelphia\">The Bible, Women and Secularism: Perspectives from London and Philadelphia\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Andrea Schatz\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schatz400_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>What would it mean for Jews to read the Bible in the political and cultural contexts of secularism? Among the first to raise this question were the maskilim and their conservative opponents in the 1780s. The controversy over Mendelssohn’s edition of the Pentateuch unfolded against the background of Protestant and Orientalist attempts to define the Bible as an “original” document that could be dissociated from the tangled exegetical web of “tradition” and studied as the core text of a religion that was compatible with reason and secularism.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>More than half a century later, the question of how modern Jews should read the Bible was still relevant. It received a new twist, when Grace Aguilar, the first successful Anglo-Jewish woman writer, and Isaac Leeser, renowned rabbi, editor and Bible translator in Philadelphia, addressed it on the pages of Aguilar’s \u003Cem>The Spirit of Judaism\u003C/em> (1842). Aguilar insisted on making the Bible universally accessible: it should be dissociated from the “obscurities” of tradition and disseminated among the entire “Hebrew nation,” including, emphatically, women and the poor. Leeser responded to this project with considerable anxiety. He supported Aguilar’s inclusive definition of the Hebrew nation, but identified the Christian subtexts of a universalist approach that was predicated on the rejection of “the trammels of tradition”: “How else are we to read Scripture, unless it be in accordance with the views of our predecessors? What else forms the distinction between us and Christians?” (100). Perhaps one of Aguilar’s answers to these questions can be found in her use of Hebrew letters whenever she discusses the Shma’ Yisra’el: in Jewish contexts, the religious, national and universal meanings of the Bible and its language converge, rendering the text unique and clearly distinct from Christian, secular and cultural Bibles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"civil-code-and-halakha-the-question-of-mixed-marriages-between-christians-and-jews\">Civil Code and Halakha: The Question of Mixed Marriages between Christians and Jews\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Eva Lezzi\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/civil-code-and-halakha-question-mixed?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/lezzi-titlepage1200.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/civil-code-and-halakha-question-mixed?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/lezzi-68-69-1200.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This book is an extraordinary and unique document that reveals the ways Prussia tried to prevent Christian-Jewish marriages on the basis of its Civil Code. In 1846 a Jewish doctor from Königsberg, Ferdinand Falkson, and his Protestant bride, Friederike Möller, were wedded in Hull, England, after they had unsuccessfully attempted to marry in Königsberg without one partner’s converting. Back in Königsberg the couple was sued by a court, which finally declared their marriage as “nichtig” [invalid] and sentenced the couple to pay for the costs of the process. Falkson himself published in 1845 and 1847 a collection of papers of importance to their case under the title Gemischte Ehen zwischen Juden und Christen.

The ALR states that a “Christian cannot enter into marriage with such persons who, according to the tenets of their religion, are hindered from subjecting themselves to the Christian laws of marriage” (ALR, II.1, section one, §36).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Falkson’s small book shows the different and contradictory arguments about the commensurability of Christian and Jewish marriage laws, ceremonies and contents. While the state attorney did not hesitate to quote antisemitic sources, such as Eisenmenger’s \u003Cem>Entdecktes Judentum\u003C/em> [Judaism Unmasked], to prove the incommensurability, the Jewish authorities were divided. In his radical reform position Rabbi Samuel Holdheim saw no obstacle against Christian-Jewish marriages.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The conservative Rabbi Jacob Oettinger, on the other hand, declared Christian-Jewish marriages as invalid according to the Bible.

Wolff was a Jewish teacher in a small village in a predominantly Catholic part of Baden (Germany), who reacted to an antisemitic treatise that was highly successful in his environment: Alban Stolz’s \u003Cem>Kalender für Zeit und Ewigkeit.\u003C/em> In this calendar for the Catholic population, Stolz had attacked Jews as enemies of the simple farmer, as treacherous petty merchants, and usurers. Following the example of earlier apologetic pieces against antisemites, Wolff was not merely defensive but sought to write a sharp, witty, and popular rebuttal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What did it mean to write poignant apologetics? It implied that one could draw on a generally intelligible language to discredit one’s enemy, and no language was as effective during this period as anti-Catholicism. Starting with conflicts in the 1840s and peaking during the so-called \u003Cem>Kulturkampf\u003C/em> of the 1870s, anti-Catholicism had become an identifying marker of liberal patriotism in Germany. At the time that Wolff wrote his pamphlet, debates on the compatibility of particular religions with good citizenship had focused not on Jews but on Catholics, and Wolff was skillful at exploiting this fact.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wolff, for example, countered the claim that Jews were taking advantage of the drinking habits of the peasantry with the following argument: The peasants’ tendency to get inebriated with brandy was in truth the result of the Catholic clergy’s pernicious activities. The priests preached the dogma of papal infallibility to women, who naturally accepted it. They then went home and demanded of their husbands that they follow them in this belief—something the men refused to do. Irritated by the domestic strife that ensued, these Catholic husbands spent their nights in the pub, drinking to forget.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As in other cases we should not read this anti-Catholicism purely as a strategy. It was rather an attempt to defend the Jews with stereotypes that the author might have well internalized. Nor did Wolff rely only on anti-Catholicism; much of the pamphlet is involved in a more traditional attempt to discredit the various accusations Stolz had made against the Jews.

Spinoza, \u003Cem>Heker ’Elohah ‘im torat ha-’adam\u003C/em> [An Investigation of God with the Science of Man], translated by S. Rubin (Vienna: G. Brag, 1885).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Dutch philosopher of Portuguese Jewish origin Baruch (or Benedictus) Spinoza (1632-1677) has undergone something of a renaissance in the last decades. The current revival is as striking for the variety of fields and genres represented as for its essentially similar bottom line: the idea of the rationalist thinker, pioneering biblical critic, and legendary conflater of God and Nature, as an originator of philosophical modernity, or perhaps we should say modernities, given the diverse and often contradictory intellectual legacies from the seventeenth century onward laid at his doorstep. One such legacy, Jonathan Israel has famously argued, was the so-called “Radical Enlightenment,” which was distinguished from the moderate mainstream within the larger Enlightenment movement by its revolutionary esprit, its refusal to accommodate itself to religion, tradition, and the past, and its open commitment to the modern and secular as such. “Spinoza and Spinozism,” Israel argues, were the ” intellectual backbone of the European Radical Enlightenment everywhere, not only in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, and Scandinavia but also Britain and Ireland.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And, we might add, in Jewish East Central Europe. Excommunicated by the Sephardic Jews of Amsterdam in 1656 for his “horrible heresies” and “monstrous deeds,” Spinoza would remain a persona non grata in Judaism for nearly two centuries thereafter. Yet in the 1840s and 1850s, the Haskalah—which had migrated from Berlin to Austrian Galicia and the Russian Empire earlier in the nineteenth century—became increasingly polarized between moderates committed to keeping the Jewish Enlightenment moored in rabbinic law and culture and militants intent on a no-holds-barred critique of tradition. These radical \u003Cem>maskilim\u003C/em>—like the European radical enlighteners of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries—turned to Spinoza and his ideas for inspiration and guidance. It was in this moment and milieu that the Amsterdam philosopher emerged, in the words of Y.H. Yerushalmi, as “the first great culture-hero of modern, secular Jews.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By far, the most zealous champion of Spinoza in the campaign to reclaim him for Hebrew literature and culture was Salomon Rubin (1823-1910), a Hebraist \u003Cem>maskil\u003C/em> from Galicia. In 1856, Rubin wrote \u003Cem>Moreh nevukhim he-hadash, or The New Guide to the Perplexed\u003C/em>, his first of what would be many works over the next fifty years of his life dedicated to Spinoza. This was a two-volume apologia for an audacious venture—a proposal to translate Spinoza’s two most notable works, the \u003Cem>Ethics\u003C/em> (1677) and the \u003Cem>Theological-Political Treatise\u003C/em> (1677), into Hebrew. Yet the justification for this scheme was in fact already inherent in Rubin’s title, which framed Spinoza as the second coming of Maimonides.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Nearly thirty years later, in 1885, Rubin finally came out with his long awaited translation of the Ethics. (He never finished translating the \u003Cem>Theological-Political Treatise\u003C/em>, which would have to wait until 1961 for a complete Hebrew rendering.) The Hebrew name he gave his translation, however, was not the literal Hebrew equivalent for the \u003Cem>Ethics of Sefer ha-middot\u003C/em> (as Jacob Klatzkin would later title his 1924 translation) but rather \u003Cem>Heker ’Elohah ‘im torat ha-’adam\u003C/em>, or An Investigation of God with the Science of Man. The change was significant. Rubin’s Spinoza was no atheist. His system—for all its trailblazing character in philosophy and science and its rejection of religious orthodoxy—was thoroughly “God-intoxicated.” Its concept of divinity, moreover, had ample precedent within medieval Jewish philosophical and mystical literature; what Spinoza had done, in essence, was to transpose a hidden history of Jewish pantheism into the clear and distinct idiom of rationalism. All this led Rubin to conclude that “Spinozism was Jewish from beginning to end.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Rubin’s translation of the Ethics is today reduced to a footnote of Jewish history and Hebrew literature. Though it played an important role in introducing many fin-de-siC(cle Hebrew rebels to Spinoza—including David Ben-Gurion (1886-1973) and Mikhah Yosef Berdichevsky (1865-1921)—it has long since been surpassed by Klatzkin’s version, which even with subsequent translations remains the standard-bearer. Yet Rubin’s \u003Cem>Investigation of Godstill\u003C/em> has much to tell us about the resonance of Spinoza in Jewish formations of the secular. The Radical Enlightenment celebrated Spinoza as a nonbeliever, revolutionary, and cosmopolitan. The \u003Cem>maskilim\u003C/em> in the Jewish version of Radical Enlightenment also heralded the Amsterdam heretic as a symbol of modernity. Yet they appropriated him somewhat differently: as a pantheist and even panentheist rather than atheist, as a revealer of the secrets of the Jewish past rather than a proponent of total rupture from tradition, and as a “Jewish” rather than strictly universal thinker and hero.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"milhemet-mitsvah-commanded-war-sighet-1888\">\u003Cem>Milhemet mitsvah (Commanded War)\u003C/em>.

The book’s title, “Commanded War,” reflects the pervasive sense of peril and need for battle of the “Kehal ha-Ortodoksen” (the “Orthodox Community” in Sighet), which was summoned to resist “those who would rise up to destroy and deny all the regulations”—in this case, another group of observant Jews who established their own community several years earlier.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The top portion of the left page is an opinion issued by the late R.

This is certainly so as regards ‘secularism’ and the division between ‘religious’ and ‘secular.’ A city of great religious significance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, Jerusalem at the same time became the symbol for nationalisms that defined themselves as definitively secular. In the Late Ottoman period—captured here in a photograph of the Jaffa Gate to the Old City of Jerusalem, ca. 1900 (from the Lenkin Family Collection at CAJSL)—Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived together and interacted with one another on a daily basis, though there was a sense, at least among intellectuals, that tensions were rising.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If these were purely ‘secular’ tensions of modern nationalisms, the language of the encounter maintained a distinctly religious tone. “I had experience with many dragomans during my sojourn in the East,” writes Albert Payson Terhune in Syria from the Saddle (1897), and nearly all were “phonographic machines (frequently out of order) with truly civilized proficiency in the arts of laziness and petty theft.” Two of the exceptions were the Christian men whose services were advertised on the wall of the Jaffa Gate plaza in this photograph: “Demitrius Domian of Jerusalem, and—head and shoulders above all others—David Jamal.” What distinguished Jamal, according to Terhune, was his thorough knowledge of the Bible “in connection with the geography of his own country.” Jamal “not only familiarized himself with every mile of ground, but learned every historical or sacred episode connected with it.” ‘Historical or sacred,’ Jerusalem’s complexities and contradictions persist.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"zionist-images--ancient-revivals-in-the-secular-national-hebrew-culture\">Zionist Images &#x26; Ancient Revivals in the Secular National Hebrew Culture\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Yael Zerubavel\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/zionist-images-ancient-revivals-secular?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/zarubavel1329.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/secularism-its-discontents/zionist-images-ancient-revivals-secular?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/zarubavel2888.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This segment of a studio image of the clandestine group \u003Cem>Hashomer\u003C/em> [The Guard, (above left)] highlights the duality of secularizing orientations among European Zionist “olim” [new immigrants] in Palestine at the beginning of the twentieth century: The transformation of the traditional “exilic Jew” into a modern European followed the ideas of the Jewish Enlightenment, and is represented by Israel Schohat on the right; and the transformation of the European Jew into a native of the Middle East and the Land of Israel is represented by his friend, Menachem Portugali, on the left. \u003Cem>Hashomer\u003C/em>’s hybrid clothes represented the desire to reconnect with the ancient Hebrew identity by borrowing clothes items from the neighboring Arabs and by imitating them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dance performances drawing on biblical images provided another creative venue for displaying the symbolic continuity between the ancient and the modern Hebrew identity (below left).

While many of these modernizing projects advocated secular platforms, many of them were also imbued with key aspects of traditional Jewish society, culture and religion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the more prominent figures in the new Jewish cultural sphere was the journalist, folklorist, and political leader Noah Prylucki. In addition to publishing the immensely popular Warsaw Yiddish dailies \u003Cem>Der veg\u003C/em> and later \u003Cem>Der moment\u003C/em>, Prylucki was repeatedly drawn to “the people.” As part of his interest in “the Jewish folk,” Prylucki headed a folklore and ethnographic group in Warsaw. The group’s activities led to the publication of the two-volume collection \u003Cem>Yiddish Folk Songs\u003C/em>, the first of which was dedicated to “Religious and Holiday Songs” (Figure #1, Prylucki’s \u003Cem>Yidishe folkslider\u003C/em>, volume 1).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This tension between a secularizing agenda and the very folk that these projects were determined to rehabilitate was one of the central themes of the Yiddish play, Der inteligent (The Intellectual) which was written by Peretz Hirschbein and published in Warsaw in 1907. Like other members of the Jewish intelligentsia, Hirschbein enjoyed many aspects of the new Jewish culture—like Yiddish theater—and was simultaneously attracted to parts of traditional Jewish society. Hirschbein would later describe the central theme of Der inteligent as: “The inner tragedy of an intellectual who did not win the trust of the masses, and for whom the psychology of the simple worker was truly foreign” (Fig. #2, Der inteligent).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yehezkel Kotik was another Jewish resident of Warsaw who found himself drawn to the modern city while yearning for more traditional communities. Kotik, who vividly recalled his experiences in his memoirs \u003Cem>Mayne zikhroynes\u003C/em>, ran a coffee house in the heart of Warsaw’s Jewish neighborhood. Like the Jewish newspaper and the Yiddish theater, Kotik’s coffee house provided a new, ostensibly secular space where Jewish urbanites could partake in new cultural activities while still maintaining many traditional modes of socialization, interaction and culture (Figure #3, cover page of \u003Cem>Mayne zikhroynes\u003C/em>).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thus, while all three cases—Prilutski’s newspaper, Hirschbein’s theater and Kotik’s café—were distinctly secular institutions that helped form the Jewish public sphere, all three projects were also deeply imbued with the spirit, culture and language of traditional Jewish society.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"gershom-scholem-the-german-translation-of-sefer-ha-bahir-berlin-schocken-verlag-1933\">Gershom Scholem, The German Translation of Sefer Ha-Bahir (Berlin: Schocken Verlag, 1933)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Galili Shahar\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/shahar600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The image shown here reproduces the title page of the 1933 edition of Gershom Scholem’s translation of and commentary on \u003Cem>Sefer Ha-Bahir\u003C/em>—the oldest book of Jewish Kabbalah in Europe. Scholem’s translation, which was submitted as part of his Ph.D. project to the University of Berlin, was first published in 1923. Scholem’s translation was not only a milestone in his early career as a Kabbalah researcher, but also marked the beginning of a new field of research in Jewish Studies. However, the translation of \u003Cem>Sefer Ha-Bahir\u003C/em> into German carries additional implications: it marks the “return of the sacred” and the dialectic of secularism in German-Jewish modernism. Scholem’s translation, besides its academic significance, hints also at the paradox of the German-Jewish “dialogue”—namely, the acknowledgment of the ambivalent aspects of Jewish being and creation in German culture. Efforts by Jews to engage in this dialogue were significant and essentially productive and original, but also became associated with self-denial, anti-Semitic rejection and finally with political violence. Scholem himself later argued against these efforts. The date and the place of this later publication of Scholem’s translation by Schocken Verlag—Berlin/1933, the same year and place that Hitler came to power—mark the impossibility, the uncanny prospect of the German-Jewish cultural project, the modernist creation of German Jews in the fields of philosophy, art, literature and politics, which carries the signature of progress and horror.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"emmanuel-levinas-carnets-de-captivité-suivis-de-ecrits-sur-la-captivité-et-notes-philosophiques-diverses-paris-editions-grassetimec-2009\">Emmanuel Levinas, Carnets de captivité, suivis de Ecrits sur la captivité, et Notes philosophiques diverses (Paris: Editions Grasset/IMEC, 2009)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Annette Aronowicz\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/aronowicz1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>This is the first in a series of three volumes intended to make available Levinas’s unpublished writings.

It is also surprising to see the extent of his literary interest, and, sometimes, in figures one would not think would draw his attention, like the Catholic writers Leon Bloy and Georges Benanos, whose work expressed a peculiar and highly suspect attitude toward Jews, which Levinas ignores in favor of some other aspect of their thought. It is also highly instructive to see how Levinas addresses Judaism in the period before he was introduced to Talmudic studies.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The sections following the war writings proper (as a matter of fact, the jottings date from before the war—1937—and conclude after the war—1950.) are more of a piece.

The difference between ‘Musikant’ and ‘Musiker’ that echoes with Adorno’s linguist decision, reveals a fascinating correspondence and a whole set of tensions—and transformations—between the sacred and the secular, the modern and the ancient, invention and tradition, innovation and repetition. This is demonstrated in a work by Marc Chagall, who shaped the image of the ancient musician, King David, according to the model of an Eastern European Musikant. Chagall’s work serves as the cover of \u003Cem>Anthology of Jewish Music: Sacred and Volk Songs of the East European Jews\u003C/em>, edited by N. Vinaver (New York, E. B. Marks 1955) that includes Schoenberg’s “Psalm 130 for Mixed Chorus,” op. 50B. The cover image reproduced here comes from a copy in the collection of the Library of the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Careful study of Arnold Schoenberg’s opera \u003Cem>Moses und Aron\u003C/em> reveals how modernist techniques of the New Music translated, re-defined, and gave a radical interpretation to concepts and ideas from the realm of Jewish tradition such as prophecy, revelation, the Mosaic Law, and prayer. When we look at how religious figures are transformed into art, and particularly how the question of monotheism and the image prohibition (i.e., the law that prohibits the making of the image of God) is elaborated in innovative musical textures, it becomes evident that Jewish secularism is not merely a process of “overcoming religion,” but rather a complex transformation of theological elements and traditions into new and ambiguous forms of aesthetic representation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Also translated and employed in the realm of secular poetics is the configuration of the violin in modern Jewish and Hebrew literature. The secular adaptations of musical images are embedded in religious traditions and loaded with biblical connotations which generate contradictory categories: lamentation which resonates with a promise of redemption, destruction that reverberates with national revival, exile that echoes with the homeland. Transformed into modernist and contemporary works of literature, they play a role in the poetic rebirth of a Zionist body, the narration of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the shape of a memory poetics after the holocaust. We see, thus, how the violin becomes a medium of identification and negation, imagination and documentation within which old and new identities are revealed, but also challenged. This transformation of musical figures exposes, however, the dissonances of secularism—namely, the dialectic relationship and tensions, the discontents and limits of secular cultures.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"religious-relations-in-a-secular-state-jews-and-muslims-in-france-circa-1968\">Religious Relations in a Secular State: Jews and Muslims in France, circa 1968\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Ethan Katz\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901102801im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/katz600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>For two days in early June 1968, rioting erupted between Jews and Muslims living in Belleville, a diverse immigrant neighborhood in Paris. The riots began with a disputed card game between a Jew and a Muslim, an illustration of the generally peaceful daily co-existence of the two groups in the neighborhood. Indeed, the large, mostly Tunisian Jewish and the sizable, mostly Algerian Muslim populations of Belleville had long lived in inter-ethnic harmony. Hallal and kosher restaurants and butcheries existed side-by-side, and Jews and Muslims often felt a shared sense of Maghrebian culture, sometimes exchanging pastries around each others’ holidays or life cycle events, as they had in North Africa. In these daily interactions, one can detect two forces, at once competing and complementary. The first is the tradition of secular French republican nationalism that privileged public unity and confined ethnic or religious identities to the private sphere. The second is Jewish and Muslim traditions from North Africa, wherein harmonious coexistence depended on related and often shared ethnic and religious traditions that did not start and stop at the door of one’s home or place of worship.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The riots, soon linked by commentators and community members to their coincidence with the first anniversary of Israel’s victory in the Six Day War, illustrated the at once explosive and harmonious potential of such a mixture. On the one hand, violence between neighbors, whose real roots lie, in significant part, in social and economic discontent, quickly gave way to a battle framed both by participants and by the media as inter-ethnic and inter-religious. Such a framework violated the terms of the secular republican pact through the simultaneous self-identification and stigmatization of individuals and groups based not on relationship to the French state, but rather on those to transnational or religious communities. On the other hand, attempts by leaders to quell the riot took two forms: a verbal insistence on the shared responsibilities of Jews and Muslims as neighbors and fellow residents of France; and a public demonstration by a pair of important Jewish and Muslim figures of inter-personal warmth and calm, as models for their communities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The latter gesture, captured in this photograph of Belleville Rabbi Emmanuel Chouchena, originally from Algeria, and Tunisian ambassador Mohamed Masmoudi, played a key role in restoring Belleville and its inter-ethnic relations to normal. The leaders’ action at once insisted on the need to uphold publicly secular French identity, and reflected a more complex reality in which minority ethnic and religious groups were becoming increasingly visible in their culture and politics. Indeed, this moment, a signal one in post-colonial France, revealed the very tensions — between the insistently unified and secular nature of French nationalism, and assertive ethnic and religious group identities — that continue to plague the Fifth Republic today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Aronowicz, Annette.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Jews and Christians on time and eternity : Charles Péguy’s portrait of Bernard-Lazare.\u003C/em> (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Asad, Talal.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Genealogies of religion : discipline and reasons of power in Christianity and Islam Baltimore.\u003C/em> (Johns Hopkins University Press, c1993)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>idem.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Formations of the secular : Christianity, Islam, modernity.\u003C/em> (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2003)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Ben-Horin, Michal.\u003C/strong> “Memory Metonymies’: Music and Photography in Ingeborg Bachmann and Monika Maron,” in German Life and Letters (59.2 (2006), 233-248).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Blumenberg, Hans.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>The legitimacy of the modern age.,\u003C/em> translated by Robert M.

Religious conversion could not be found in the Hebrew Bible; Pauline Christians were shown to be at constant risk of Judaism; Greek speaking Jews worried about the seductions of Hellenistic philosophical education; late medieval and early modern ones became Christian, or Muslim, or both and neither; twentieth-century Italian catholic villagers became Jewish and moved to Israel; and twenty-first century American communities performed their boundaries through dating web-sites in which Judaism became a strategic part of courtship displays. Fellows also discovered the joys of crossing the boundaries between their subjects, boundaries that, however stable they might be elsewhere, at the Katz Center proved quite permeable. The result was a year that transformed—or at least complicated—whatever we thought we meant, not only by \"Judaic,\" but also by \"Christian\" and \"Islamic.\"\n\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: right\">David Nirenberg\u003C/p>\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### \"Ecclesia ex circumcisione\" and \"Ecclesia ex gentibus\"\n\nDavid Satran\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sta-sabina.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nAt the heart of the \"crisis of identity\" of emergent Christianity lies the question of the relationship of the new faith with the Jewish community from which it emerges. While the earliest followers of Jesus were Jews in terms of ethnic descent and ritual practice, the survival of the early Church (and the fortunes of Christianity in the Roman world ) ultimately depended on the rapidly growing number of converts from \"the nations\" gentiles or pagans, in Christian discourse. Eloquent witness to this tension can be found already in the letters of the apostle Paul and its reverberations in subsequent theology and exegesis.\n\nVisual testimony to this seminal ideal of a dual source of new believers may be offered by a very intriguing pair of female figures in the Church of Santa Sabina all'Aventino in Rome. Over the cypress doors of the church, there is a dedicatory mosaic (recording the building of the church by Peter the Illyrian in the early fifth-century C.E.) which is flanked by two women who bear the titular subscriptions ecclesia ex circumcisione (\"The Church from the Circumcision\") and ecclesia ex gentibus, (\"The Church from the Nations\"). Though some scholars have suggested that these figures are the Old and New Testaments, it seems far more likely that they are intended to represent the two sources of the Church: Christians of Jewish origins and the Christians who were converts from pagan backgrounds. What these striking female figures most definitely should not be confused with is the later medieval representation of the antinomy between Church and Synagogue.\n\n### Maimonides, Dalalat al-Ha'irin, \"The Guide of the Perplexed\"\n\nAyala Eliyahu\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/4795_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"See this leaf in the context of Penn's Cairo Genizah Site\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis manuscript from the CAJS collection was found in the Cairo Genizah, a unique collection of manuscripts found in Fustat (old Cairo) in the second half of the 19th century. These manuscripts, mostly written in Judaeo-Arabic (Arabic in Hebrew letters with many Hebrew expressions), come essentially from the 9th to the 13th century. They belong to various literary genres, thus revealing unknown aspects of the daily life and literary creation of the Jewish communities represented in the Genizah.\n\nFustat was the home of the author of this manuscript, one of the leading figures of Judaism - Moses Maimonides (Cordoba 1138 - Fustat 1204). His Dalalat al-Ha'irin, \"The Guide of the Perplexed,\" is one of the most important books of medieval Jewish philosophy. Written in Judaeo-Arabic, it aims to present a philosophical interpretation of Judaism to the intellectual Jewish reader.\n\nDespite Maimonides' central place in Jewish thought and _Halacha,_ some historical sources have reported that he had been forced to convert to Islam in his youth, when living under the rule of the Almohads, who ruled Spain and North-Africa. After living openly as a Muslim and secretly as a Jew for several years, Maimonides left the Almohad lands, visited _Erez Israel_ and finally settled in Fustat.\n\nThe case of Maimonides, if he indeed converted, was not isolated: many Jews converted to Islam in the Islamic lands. Some of them were forced to convert, others converted out of belief in Islam, and others probably found it more comfortable to be Muslims. The philosopher and physician Abu'l Barakat al-Baghdadi, an older contemporary of Maimonides (d. 1164-5), was one of these converts. The historical sources give contradictory reports of his conversion, which was probably motivated by convenience reasons. Like Maimonides, Abu'l Barakat does not refer to his conversion in his writings. However, further research of the relationship between his philosophical book (Al-Kitab Al-Mu'tabar) and his commentary to _Kohelet_ might shed some light on his attitude towards philosophy and religion, and perhaps give a clue for understanding his conversion.\n\n### R.

In a treatise entitled Moreh Hattaʾim/Sefer Kapparot, which was reproduced in the parallel early fourteenth-century Provencal compendia, Sefer Orhot Hayyim le-Aharon ha-Kohen mi-Lunel and in the anonymous Sefer Kol Bo (extant in some fifteen manuscripts), Eleazar presented a penitential regimen for a Jew who had converted to Christianity and now wished to return to the Jewish community.\n\nIn order not to dissuade this reverting Jew, Eleazar is relatively mild in the physical discomforts and afflictions that he recommends. Crucial to this regimen, however, are two highly symbolic and suggestive acts: the reverting Jew must restrain himself from entering a church and even from talking to priests and clergymen at the entrance way, and he must immerse himself in a ritual bath. These actions were intended by Eleazar to serve as a kind of \"unbaptism,\" and to sever substantive ties with the Christian community, as an essential part of the process of expiation and re-acceptance into the Jewish community.\n\n### A Converso Theologian: Alonso de Cartagena\n\nClaude Stuczynski\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/stuczynski364.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nContemporary scholarship has endorsed with increasing frequency the claim that sincere and fervent converts from Judaism to Christianity on the Iberian Peninsula developed a distinctive _Converso_ theology. By this account, _Converso_ theology, even as it completely accorded with Catholic faith and ritual, also emphasized the positive and central role played by Jews and Christians of Jewish descent in the history of Mankind's Salvation, as represented by figures like the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ and St. Paul. _Converso_ theologians have been recognized for diminishing the responsibility of the Jews in the crucifixion, claiming that Romans were also to be blamed. Moreover, the crucifixion was described as part of God's plan to redeem humanity, a reading based on St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, chapter 11.\n\nAlonso de Cartagena (1384-1456), the distinguished Bishop, diplomat, historian, courtier and precursor of Spanish humanism, was one of the major figures among these _Converso_ theologians. As the second son of the converted Rabbi Salomon Halevi of Burgos / Pablo de Santa Maria, he was baptized with his father and his brethren at the age of five, and became one of the most illustrious members of the Santa Maria clan that included writers, historians, soldiers, courtiers, theologians and churchmen. Cartagena continued his father's path as Bishop of Burgos and also elaborated on the idea that Santa Maria family were scions of both the tribe of Levi and of the Virgin Mary. His _Converso_ theology was mainly expressed in his Defensorium unitatis christianae (1449-50): a tract that successfully reacted against anti-_Converso_ measures adopted by 1449's Toledo rebels. Cartagena, elaborated on the Pauline-based theological-political concept of the \"Mystical Body\" (_Corpus Mysticum_), claiming that _Conversos_ are to be considered as full members of the Church, and that any attempt to segregate them on an ethnic or racial basis is an un-Christian \"pagan heresy.\" Nonetheless, a close reading of Cartagena's writings shows that he had difficulties reconciling theological views such as St. Paul's ideas on inclusive Christian equality \"neither Jew nor Greek\" Galatians 3:28) with beliefs in collective common traits (e.g., the mildness of the Jews vs. the courage of the Goths), as well as regarding St. Paul's recognition of Jewish Christ believers as a distinct part of the Christian body (I Corinthians 12:12-14).\n\n### Pablo de Santa María and his Scrutinium scripturarum\n\nYosi Israeli\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/israeli900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nPablo de Santa María (or Shlomo Halevi by his prior name) is regarded as one of the most radical and astonishing examples of Jewish conversion to Christianity in the Middle Ages. The conversion of this celebrated Rabbi from Burgos, who joined the Christian clergy and became the bishop of his own home town, captures in many ways the sudden breakdown and mass conversions of Iberian Jewry that followed the riots of 1391. In the early 1430s, already as a bishop he wrote a twofold dialogue between a Christian and a Jew and between a magister and his recently converted disciple - The Scrutinium scripturarum (Scrutiny of the Scriptures) - in which he presented the theological path that leads from Judaism to Christianity. The Scrutinium provided its readers not only with a scholarly Latin account of the Christian and the Jewish polemical strategies of that crucial time, but also with a bold attempt to use rabbinical literature and Hebrew scholarship as legitimate means for crystallizing Christian truths and with a defense of the spiritual and carnal Israelite origins of Jewish converts to Christianity. Thus, while it was following the guidelines of a catechesis or a missionary handbook, it eventually turned into a best seller mostly because of its contribution to the awaking interest in Hebraic studies in the late 15th century. It was therefore printed during the 1470s in six different editions, including this 1475 Mantua edition by Johannes Schallus. In this sense, the Scrutinium serves as an example to the long-term cultural and intellectual impact that the mass conversions in the Iberian Peninsula and its products had on the Christian world well beyond the Spanish kingdoms.\n\n### The Invisible Printer: The Hijar Hebrew Bible Incunable and the Changing Attitudes toward Iberian Conversos\\*\n\nJavier Castaño\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/castano1200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nFive out of ten Hebrew incunabula from the Aragonese print shop at Hijar are editions of the Bible printed between 1486 and 1490. They barely provide us with the names of the printer Eliezer Alantansi, its financier, and the proof-reader, all Jews. We search in vain in the colophons for any reference to the wandering printer and type-cutter Alfonso Fernandez de Cordoba, a Castilian silversmith, whose early known footsteps place him in 1476 Valencia, despite the fact that according to some clues he would have been instrumental in the development of the Hijar print shop.\n\nFernandez de Cordoba's case may not have been exceptional. As is true for the Hebrew humanist printer Juan de Lucena, we must rely on external documentary sources for indirect hints of Fernandez de Cordoba's association with Jews involved in printing activities. However, in sharp contrast with Lucena, we still lack conclusive evidence concerning the fact that Fernandez de Cordoba was a _converso._ Both may well exemplify the cultural and social predicament of a generation of _conversos_ in a transitional period after the establishment, after 1480, of inquisitional courts that attempted to set clear-cut religious boundaries and taxonomies through the control of the social body and individual consciousness.\n\nDocumentary sources frequently associate _conversos_ (though not exclusively) with Bible reading in the vernacular, in connection with new forms of religious devotion, and, thus, from an early date we find several initiatives for the printing of vernacular Bibles by _conversos_. In 1476, Fernandez de Cordoba associated with a German craftsman for the production of the _Biblia Valenciana_, a not exceptional case. Two years later, three Aragonese merchants and a notary, all _conversos_ that assiduously socialized with their Jewish relatives, contracted with Pablo Hurus in Saragossa for the printing of another Bible in the vernacular. Inquisitorial persecution hampered these initiatives and the copies were promptly destroyed.\n\nSome developments in the early summer of 1483 in Valencia may be taken into consideration for understanding the background for the establishment, two years later, of a Hebrew print shop at Hijar. For several weeks, the editors in charge of the _Biblia Valenciana_, among them Daniel Vives, the _converso_ proofreader, had been interrogated by the inquisitors. Key for the latter was to determine if the proofreader or someone else had checked the vernacular translation with a Hebrew original, or if he knew of any Christian holding a Hebrew Bible. Fernandez de Cordoba had been absent from the city in the previous months, and therefore was not included among those under arrest. However, another source specifies that local authorities were looking after him, and in fact he was surreptitiously in Valencia signing, together with a notary and the Jewish financier Zalmati, the terms for the publication of the works of Bishop Jaime Perez de Valencia. Interestingly enough, the latter's work was clearly anti-Jewish. Whether this printing was done under duress or not is uncertain, though, in any event, the publication may have contributed to mollifying some ecclesiastical attitudes toward the editors.\n\nIn addition to securing the financial resources for such a venture, Zalmati appears later on as the financier of the Hijar Hebrew print shop. Collaboration between Fernandez de Cordoba and him was not exceptional, and, thus, in 1484 both appear in charge of the printing of another ecclesiastical work, the _Breviarium Carthaginense_ (which, for the first time, contains the seal that will be associated later on with the Hijar Hebrew incunables).\n\nAbout the same time, the printer Eliezer Alantansi, scion of a prominent family of Huesca and trained professionally as a physician, had been sent by his relatives to the small town of Hijar in order to prevent his youthful intention of converting to Christianity, according to a testimony brought before the inquisitors some years later. Whether or not we grant any reliability to this information, it is not out of the question that Alantansi's transfer to Hijar may have contributed to strengthening his Jewish religious convictions.\n\nIn contrast with the Christian type-cutter mentioned in the Guadalajara 1476 Hebrew incunable colophon, Alfonso Fernandez de Cordoba as well as Juan de Lucena were invisible printers. Following the advent of the Inquisition, the participation of _conversos_ in Hebrew print shops became a problematic issue not lacking risks, due to the heretical nature attached to Hebrew culture. Thus, transition to print coincided with a change in the attitudes towards _conversos_ that forced them to find new ways to ease their participation in cultural and social common spaces shared by Jews and Christians, among them, printing and reading. Under these new circumstances, invisibility became an advantage.\n\n### Fraudulent Converts: The Linguistic Evidence\n\nRobert Jütte\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/jutte900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe Rare Book & Manuscript Library at the University of Pennsylvania holds a rare copy of Die Rotwelsch Grammatic printed in Basel around 1540. It describes _Rotwelsch,_ a secret language prevalent amongst beggars, vagabonds, pedlars and itinerant craftsmen from the Middle Ages onwards. This cant is based on German but has a large proportion of words from Hebrew, Italian, Romani (\"Gipsy\") languages, Latin and other languages. The first references to _Rotwelsch_ can be found in a text in Medieval High German dating from around 1250. From the 15th century onwards this cant became identified as the language of false beggars and thieves. \\_Rotwelsch\\_vocabulary became part of the so called \"literature of roguery.\" The most famous example of this type of popular literature is the Liber Vagatorum (Book of Vagrants) which was first printed in 1510 and went through many editions and translations. No other than Martin Luther wrote the preface to the 1528 German edition of the Liber Vagatorum.\n\nAbout the same time, copycats of this book of rogues appeared under the title Die Rotwelsch Grammatic. The copy in the Van Pelt Library consists of 28 printed pages. The title page shows a woodcut of a man and a woman, clearly dressed as wayfarers. The text is in early modern German. There is a short vocabulary of _Rotwelsch_ as well as notes on grammar and language. The text then introduces different types and groups of vagrants. Each carries a _Rotwelsch_ name. A special type of fraud already mentioned in the Liber Vagatorum is fraudulent conversion. Especially Christian women were reputed to be such impostors, claiming to have been converted from Judaism. These female cozeners are called _veranerin_ in _Rotwelsch._ In French and Italian pamphlets on roguery, fraudsters of this type are known as _convertis_ and _iucchi_ respectively. The first Hebrew sources on these _rekim_(ריקים, empty people), as Rabbi Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg (c. 1215-1293) called them, date back to the middle of the 13th century. His contemporary, Rabbi Solomon ben Abraham Adret (c. 1235-c.1310), reports that the French rabbinical authorities also had to address the problem of Jews wandering from town to town, posing as Christians to Christians and as Jews when entering the homes of Jews. Since the 15th century, just as the number of fraudulent converts from Judaism began to rise noticeably, the economic condition of converts became linked to the larger discourse on poverty and on crime committed by socially marginal groups. Jewish impostors became part of literary descriptions of the \"dangerous classes\" (_Gaunerbüchlein_), as in the Liber Vagatorum or the Rotwelsch Grammatic.\n\n### Johannes Isaac Levita (1515-1577), New-Christian Hebraist\n\nTheodor Dunkelgrün\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dunkelgrun1567-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/taking-turns/johannes-isaac-levita-1515-1577-new-christian-hebraist?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dunkelgrun1581-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/taking-turns/johannes-isaac-levita-1515-1577-new-christian-hebraist?item=1)\n\nYtzig ha-Levi, a rabbi from Wetzlar in Hesse, converted to Christianity in 1546 after coming to read the Man of Sorrows in Isaiah 53 as a prophecy of Jesus Christ. He was baptized shortly after Luther's death in 1546, along with his young son Jacob, by the Lutheran theologian and biblical scholar Johannes Draconites (Drach). Christened Johannes Isaac Levita, he entered the University of Marburg. The Rabbi from Hesse became a Christian in an age of flourishing German Humanism, but also in the midst of a deepening confessional divide that was tearing apart Europe. When Hesse fell to the armies of Charles V in the Schmalkaldic War, Johannes Isaac was brought to the Netherlands to teach Hebrew at Louvain, and converted again, this time to Catholicism. In the early 1550s Johannes Isaac took up the chair of Hebrew at Cologne, where he would teach until his death in 1577. He entered a world hungry for Hebrew learning, but was also cast upon waves of religious warfare, especially when his gifted son Stephan (Jacob), abandoned Catholicism and converted a third time, to the Reformed Church.\n\nSome forty years before, Cologne had been a mighty fortress of resistance against the study of Hebrew by Christians and its chief advocate, Johannes Reuchlin. Another Jewish convert, Johannes Pfefferkorn, had infamously tried to persuade the Emperor to round up and burn all Hebrew books in his realm. But Johannes Isaac was a different kind of convert. Rather than fiercely turning on his former coreligionists, as Pfefferkorn had done, Johannes Isaac worked tirelessly to persuade the world of Christian Humanists that the traditions of Hebrew and Jewish scholarship were important, even necessary, to the understanding of Sacred Scripture, of Christianity itself. Johannes Isaac's appointment to the chair of Hebrew at Cologne was a testimony to the victory of Catholic Biblical Humanism, as an ideal of learning and as a program of education.\n\nJohannes Isaac would publish Hebrew grammars of his own as well as revised and expanded editions of grammars of others. He would also translate classics of Hebrew literature such as Maimonides' Letter on Astrology and the Sefer Ruah Hen into Latin, serving as a vital intermediary, bridging two different and distant worlds: the Jewish philosophy of Medieval Spain and Egypt, and the Republic of Letters of the Renaissance Humanists. In 1563-64, he was granted a year's leave of absence to help Christopher Plantin, a French printer established in Antwerp, to put to use the Hebrew types that he had been given on loan by the heirs of the Netherlandish printer in Venice, Daniel Bomberg. These were the very types with which such monuments of Jewish learning—and of Christian Hebrew printing—as the _editio princeps_ of the complete Babylonian Talmud and the Rabbinic Bibles had been set. In teaching Hebrew and Aramaic to a generation of Catholic Hebraists at Cologne, and in teaching the staff of a printing shop which would go on to become one of the most important Christian printers of Hebrew in the latter half of the sixteenth century, Johannes Isaac played a pivotal role in the world of Northern Humanism.\n\nUnlike crypto-Jews, who continued to secretly observe Judaism while living outwardly as Christians, Johannes Isaac's Christian faith, to all appearances, seems to have been real and sincere. If he remained loyal, it was not to the Law of Moses, but to the textual tradition of the Hebrew Bible in a wide and deep sense of the term. In sixteenth century Europe, Johannes Isaac, and like him a small set of deeply learned converted Jewish scholars such as Alfonso de Zamora in Castile, Felix Pratensis and Jacob ben Chaim ibn Adoniya in Venice and Paul Paradis in Paris, played an indispensable role, both in establishing Hebrew as part of the scholarly curriculum of European universities, and in editing editions of the Hebrew Bible printed by Christian printers for a Christian scholarly readership.\n\nThe Hebraica and Judaica Collections at the University of Pennsylvania preserve two copies of the Tabulae in Grammaticam Hebraeam, one of the most popular Hebrew grammars of the Early Modern period, composed by the path breaking Netherlandish scholar of Greek, Hebrew and Arabic, Nicolas Clenardus or Cleynaerts (1493-1542), in editions that were revised and expanded with commentary by Johannes Isaac. The oldest copy (Cologne, 1567) is at the Library at the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies. The second copy, in the Van Pelt Library Rare Book and Manuscript Library, once belonged to a Jean Merlin, possibly a relative of Jean-Raymond Merlin, the founding professor of Hebrew at the Calvinist Academy of Lausanne (though the latter died three years prior to this publication).\n\n### Portuguese Conversos, Economy and Politics\n\nClaude Stuczynski\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/stuczynski2a560.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/taking-turns/portuguese-conversos-economy-and-politics?item=0)\n\nFig. 1\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/stuczynski2b560.gif\" alt=\"Fig. 2\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/taking-turns/portuguese-conversos-economy-and-politics?item=1)\n\nFig. 2\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/stuczynski2c212.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/taking-turns/portuguese-conversos-economy-and-politics?item=2)\n\nThe mass conversion of Jews in Portugal to Catholicism in 1497, which led to the creation of a _Converso_ or New Christian social group within that society, evolved at the precise moment when Portugal became a seaborne empire. Many _Conversos_ prospered in this emerging merchant class, becoming dominant in international trade and banking. From the sixteenth century onwards, they were called: \"businessmen\" or \"men of commerce\" (\"hómens de negócios\"), adding a socio-economic stereotype to the religious accusation of being judaizers or \"potential Jews.\" However, that cliché also served _Conversos_ and their sympathizers to claim that Portugal's prosperity depended on these \"men of commerce. \" Therefore, to avoid economical collapse _Conversos_ have to be integrated, they argued, into the \"Old Christian \" society, including the elites. To attain that goal, prejudices against them, the biased procedures adopted by the Portuguese Inquisition and the juridical ethnic segregation inspired by the \"laws of purity of blood \" would have to disappear.\n\nDuring the seventeenth century, several tracts imbued with Mercantilism subsumed Iberian economic restoration to _Converso_ integration. These pro-_Converso_ writings were far from being homogeneous, since beyond diversity of approach, all of them had to reconcile their calls for integration with the recognition that Christians of Jewish descents could be perceived as a separate group, since they were gifted in commerce. Thus, while the Spanish _licenciado_ Martín González de Cellorigo (1565?-1630?) \\[fig. 1\\] advocated a royal policy of integration of the group, the Portuguese\\_Converso\\_ merchant Duarte Gomes Solis (c. 1561- c. 1630) \\[fig. 2\\] called to reduce it to a small group of rich New Christian merchants. The great preacher and missionary Jesuit, Father António Vieira (1608- 1697) \\[fig. 3\\], was the most persistent and brilliant advocate on behalf of the Portuguese _Conversos._ For him, a real integration of the New Christians into Catholic society was needed both to ensure Portugal's economic prosperity and to enable that kingdom to fulfill the role of promoting Christian messianic salvation.\n\n### Richard Bernard, Ruths Recompense: Or A Commentarie upon the Book of Ruth, 1628\n\nJeffrey Shoulson\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/shoulson900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nRichard Bernard (1568-1641) was a moderate Puritan clergyman. Though he flirted at times with separatism, he spent most of his career preaching and practicing a kind of nonconformity within the established English church. He was a prolific writer, publishing more than thirty tracts, treatises, and collected sermons during his lifetime, many of which went through several more printings after his death. His most influential work, a handbook for ministers entitled The Faithfull Shepheard and his Practice, was published first in 1607 and then again, in revised form, in 1621. His allegorical work, The Isle of Man, went through seventeen separate editions between the time of its first publication in 1627 and the end of the eighteenth century. It is believed to have exercised significant influence on, and served as an important precedent for, John Bunyan's allegorical conversion narrative, The Holy War (1682).\n\nBernard had several connections with the recently established English colonies in North America, as well. During his time in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, he associated with William Brewster and John Robinson, separatists who were involved in the voyage of the Mayflower. His daughter Mary married Roger Williams in 1629 and emigrated with him to New England in 1631, where they eventually founded the colony of Rhode Island.\n\nRuths Recompense is a verse-by-verse commentary on the book of Ruth, collated from sermons Bernard composed and delivered over several years. Like many of his contemporaries, and indeed like Jewish and Christian readers through the centuries, Bernard regarded Ruth as a paradigmatic convert, exemplary in her self-sacrificing faith and commitment to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and to the people of Israel. What made Ruth especially important to Christian readers, of course, was her role within the Davidic line and, therefore, her function as a living ancestor of Christ. Both through her body and through her faith, Ruth's conversion paved the way for the salvation of the Gentiles. In so doing, however, she also became a critical figure within Christian theories of supersession and the increasingly intense arguments in the 1620s about whether English Protestants should expect, and work for, the \"calling of the Jews,\" their recovery as God's (first) chosen people.\n\nBernard dedicated the volume to Lady Frances, the Countess Dowager of Warwick, who had been his patron when he was a young and promising scholar, paying his way at Christ's College, Cambridge. Christ's happened to be the college where the most influential Puritan theorist of conversion, William Perkins, served as fellow while Bernard was a student there. Bernard's reading of Ruth exhibits a significant influence by Perkins, who had developed a morphology of conversion, an approach to conversion as a progression through various inner states of despair and reassurance. In his discussion of Ruth's conversion it is possible to see Bernard applying Perkins's _ordo salutis,_ \"order of salvation,\" which was noteworthy for its departure from the rigidly Calvinist idea that man's will could play no role in his conversion. Bernard celebrates both Ruth's \"calling out of her own people\" and her voluntary choice to live a \"virtuous life,\" in which she exhibited the hallmarks of salvation by being joined \"together with members of Christ's mystical body.\"\n\n### The 1661 Amsterdam Edition of the Ferrara Bible: Made for a Market of New Jews\n\nAnne Oravetz Albert\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/albert900%402x_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis Spanish Bible is an example of the many books produced especially for newcomers to Judaism in the Sephardi community of seventeenth-century Amsterdam. Most of these immigrants were former \\_conversos,\\_descendants of Jewish converts to Catholicism who were escaping from the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal. Although they were not required to convert because they identified themselves as Jewish by ancestry, the adoption of a Jewish lifestyle and participation in the Jewish community required a significant adjustment. Upon arrival, most lacked basic knowledge of Hebrew and Jewish law, and vernacular Bibles like this one were just one element of the copious literature published in Spanish and Portuguese to guide them in their new Jewish practice.\n\nThe printer of this 1661 edition of the Bible, Joseph Athias, was himself a former _converso,_ having been born in Spain and arriving in Amsterdam only as an adult. He is best known for his well-received Hebrew edition produced in the same year, but this edition, a version of the earlier Ferrara Bible newly corrected by Samuel de Cáceres, was explicitly intended for returnees to Judaism. The prologue noted that it would benefit those who were \"returning from Spain to the company of the Blessed God,\" and the title page, shown here, includes an illustration acknowledging the edition's intended readers' status as former _conversos_ and their new lives as Jews. It depicts a phoenix, a symbol of the Amsterdam community since it had risen, like the mythical bird, from the ashes of its previous incarnation, i.e., Iberian Jewry. Inside this phoenix appear two groups of travelers embracing, as if they had completed a long journey apart from each other. Just as these estranged travelers met within the breast of the phoenix, so was the Spanish-speaking reader of this Bible presumed to find fellowship with other former _conversos_ in Amsterdam.\n\n### Der Jude: Conversion and the Popularization of Jewish Literature\n\nPawel Maciejko\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/maciejko900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nDer Jude was possibly the first periodical entirely devoted to Jews and Judaism. It was published by the convert Gottfried Selig (1722-1792?), who following his conversion in 1738 served as a lector of Hebrew at the University of Leipzig. In 1768, Selig founded Der Jude, which appeared in weekly installments (every quarter bound into a single volume) till 1772.\n\nAll in all, nine quarterly volumes appeared. Numerous scholars and libraries subscribed to the periodical and it fulfilled an important role as a prime means of transmission of knowledge of Jews and Judaism to the learned public. As such, it popularized the accounts of Jewish literature and lore beyond the academic circles of Christian Hebrasists. Selig saw his task as a scientific presentation of Judaism to the wider public; he claimed to have based his publication solely on Jewish sources and devoted considerable attention to correcting mistakes and inaccuracies of Christian scholars.\n\n### Reflections on Ruth in Grace Aguilar's The Women of Israel (1887)\n\nSarah Gracombe\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/gracombe900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nPart literary biography, part midrash, part conduct book, The Women of Israel likely became the best-known work of the Victorian era's best-known Anglo-Jewish woman writer, Grace Aguilar. It had a transatlantic life long after its first publication in 1844, as demonstrated by this American edition from 1887, and was praised by both Jewish and Christian reviewers. Indeed, the Methodist periodical Ladies' Repository particularly lauded this edition for its beauty, something evident in the frontispiece's delicately entwined lettering and pensive yet strong female figure. The Women of Israel argues for what Aguilar views as the long overlooked importance of such women in the Bible and earlier Jewish history. But it also serves as a \"warning\" and \"example\" for Victorian Jews; as Aguilar asserts, \"The women of the bible are but mirrors of ourselves.\"\n\nReflections of contemporary debates about the compatibility of Jewishness and Englishness are particularly evident in Aguilar's explication of the Book of Ruth, one that perfectly embodies the opportunities and challenges Ruth's ambiguous conversion posed in the nineteenth century. On the one hand, Aguilar claims that Ruth \"does not properly belong by birth and ancestry to the women of Israel,\" a lineal or racial belonging that cannot be erased even after conversion and marriage. On the other hand, Aguilar recognizes that Ruth is \"so entwined\" with the people she joins that she cannot be ignored.\n\nReading against the grain, to use an apt harvest metaphor, illuminates how The Women of Israel employs Ruth to consider whether Anglo-Jews can \"convert\" to Englishness while still preserving ties to their ancestral and religious pasts. Aguilar subtly inverts the original story, aligning the non-Jewish Ruth with Victorian Jews and the Jewish Naomi with Protestant England. This inversion is evident in Aguilar's repeated emphasis on Ruth's _choosing_ to become a Jew, which makes her \"as worthy if not even more so to be the ancestress of David than the lineal descendants of Abraham.\" Aguilar lauds the way Ruth \"voluntarily engrafted herself upon the children of God . . . her acceptance of, and obedience to, the Law were entirely _voluntary_; not merely received from education and as heritage.\" For Aguilar, Victorian Jews are like Ruth in that they voluntarily chose England and accepted English laws and habits; thus they could be viewed as not only equally but even more worthy of Englishness than those who have \"merely\" inherited it.\n\nWhat Aguilar's interpretation reminds us is that representations of Ruth in Victorian culture—and there were many—were written against the backdrop of an expanding England, one struggling with immigration and empire, conversion and emancipation. By privileging choice and faith over blood and race, Aguilar attempts to transform the potentially unsettling fact that Ruth continues to be seen as simultaneously Israelite and Moabite into a model for Anglo-Jews to be both English and Jewish. Her Ruth maintains a degree of difference, yet is emphatically part of the national family, \"entwined\" with Englishness.\n\n### Conversion in Tsarist Russia\n\nEllie Schainker\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schainker900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nPublished by the Institutum Judaicum in Berlin for missionary work among Jews under the leadership of H. L. Strak (founded 1883), de le Roi's pamphlet is the commonly cited source for statistics on Jewish conversions to Christianity in nineteenth-century Europe. This work is particularly valuable, though not necessarily exhaustive, for arriving at a conservative guesstimate of the number of Jewish conversions in imperial Russia to Christian denominations other than Russian Orthodoxy, the legally \"preeminent and predominant\" church in the empire. De le Roi calculates that 3,136 Russian Jews converted to various Protestant confessions and 12,000 converted to Catholicism. According to this seemingly low estimate, of the approximately 84,500 converts from Judaism, 18% took place outside of the state church, and this percentage can rise as high as 28% if we focus exclusively on civilian conversions.\n\nThis book is significant for the study of Jewish conversions in the Russian empire for two main reasons. First, though conversion records of Jews abound in imperial archives in the Former Soviet Union, no institution in the empire aside from the Russian Orthodox church maintained yearly statistical records of converts. The Holy Synod, the lay governing body of the Russian Orthodox church, published yearly reports on converts categorizing them by province and former confession. As we lack such aggregate data from the Protestant and Catholic churches in the empire, de le Roi's work is at least a starting point for considering the extent to which Jews looked outside of the state church for religious conversion. Second, de le Roi's focus on all Christian conversions is a sound reminder that we risk oversimplification if we understand conversion in the self-consciously multi-confessional and multi-ethnic empire of Russia as a radical expression of Jews becoming \"Russian.\" Russian Orthodoxy was not identical with imperial subjecthood, and official religious tolerance and institutional supports for the \"tolerated foreign confessions\" granted Jews a measure of confessional choice when converting. Thus, de le Roi's statistics on non-Orthodox conversions reminds us that Jewish conversion was not just an act of assimilation to some undefined imperial mainstream devoid of religious significance, and that it pays to consider the ways in which conversion in such an imperial setting was a local, individual affair, influenced by daily inter-confessional sociability and religious influence and access, rather than a \"national\" and purely instrumental act.\n\n### Hymns of the Converts of Sannicandro Garganico\n\nFabrizio Lelli\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/lelli900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nMusic played a significant role in the conversion to Judaism of a small group of Catholics in Sannicandro Garganico, a village located in Northern Apulia, Italy. At the end of the 1920s, Donato Manduzio (1885- 1948), a quasi illiterate cobbler, decided to start a new religious movement, possibly inspired by the revelatory and prophetic nature of Protestant confessions that had made proselytes in early twentieth century Southern Italy.\n\nIn spite of its very strong messianic orientation, Manduzio soon rejected the Christological tradition and stressed instead the literal observance of most of the prescriptions contained in the Pentateuch. When in 1946 his followers and he officially converted to Judaism, a proper ritual had already been established and put into practice in Sannicandro. Services were performed in Italian, and hymns were written either by Manduzio or by the women of the group. After most of the Jews of Sannicandro made _aliyah_ in the aftermath of the establishment of the State of Israel, the ritual in Sannicandro came to be performed exclusively by women.\n\nThe songs of the Sannicandro Jews were recorded in the 1950s in Israel by Leo Levi (1912-1982). A new recording has been made available by Francesco Lotoro and Paolo Candido, who, in their volume, offer a transcription of the autograph manuscripts of the \"Hymnal\" of Donato Manduzio and provide new and interesting insights into the importance of music in the Sannicandro community.\n\n### The State of Israel's Law of Return\n\nNetanel Fisher\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/fishernt.jpg\" alt=\"www.knesset.gov.il: The Law of Return\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n[www.knesset.gov.il](http://www.knesset.gov.il)[: The Law of Return](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114/http://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/return.htm)\n\nThe Law of Return is a symbol and one of the most important laws of the State of Israel. It testifies to the fact that the State perceives itself to be the State of the whole Jewish People. In accordance with this law, the State allows any Jew in the world to enter its territory and almost automatically become a citizen. However, this short and well-known law also embodies the great struggle which has been going on in the Zionist movement for the past hundred years regarding the national Jewish identity:\n\nThe Law, which was passed in 1950, declared that \"Every Jew is eligible to immigrate to Israel.\" However, it did not specify how \"Jew\" was to be defined. One of the reasons for this omission was the secular-national worldview, held by the State's founders, such as David Ben Gurion, according to which everyone who was willing to be part of the new State of Israel and had either Jewish roots or relatives, could be considered a Jew. One could join the Jewish people by undergoing a period of social and territorial integration.\n\nHowever, since the 1970s the political landscape has changed. The secular-nationalist ideology has weakened, and stronger ties between religion and nationality have taken its place. As a result, the Law of Return was changed, and a Jew was defined as someone whose mother was Jewish or who has converted to Judaism, without clearly stating whether the conversion need be in accordance with Jewish religious law (halakhah) or not. This change has given rise to unending conflicts and disputes, also known as the question of conversion to Judaism, namely: \"Who is a Jew\" or \"Who is a Convert.\"\n\nContemporary voices calling for yet another change in the Law of Return, in light of societal and ideological changes in Israel and the Diaspora, reflect the fact that the struggle over the definition of \"Jew\" and \"conversion\" to Judaism is still alive and relevant.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Albert, Anne Oravetz.** _Post-sabbatian politics : reflections on governance among the Spanish and Portuguese Jews of Amsterdam, 1665-1683._ ((Dissertation: Thesis (Ph.D.): University of Pennsylvania, 2008)\n    \n*   **Bar-Asher, Mosheh (editor).** S_hai le-Śarah Yafet : meḥḳarim ba-Miḳra, be-farshanuto uvi-leshono._ Yerushalayim : Mosad Byalik, c2007\n    \n*   **Castaño, Javier.** \"Social networks in a Castilian Aljama and the Court Jews in the Fifteenth Century : A Preliminary Survey (Madrid 1440-1475),\" in _la Espania Medieval_ (no. 20 (1997)).\n    \n*   **Castaño, Javier.** \"Subordinación y parcialidades durante los 'tiempos rotos': Mosé Tamaño y el juzgado mayor de la aljama de Ávila,\" in _Cristianos y judíos en contacto en la Edad Media: polémica, conversión, dinero y convivencia,_ F.

Religious conversion could not be found in the Hebrew Bible; Pauline Christians were shown to be at constant risk of Judaism; Greek speaking Jews worried about the seductions of Hellenistic philosophical education; late medieval and early modern ones became Christian, or Muslim, or both and neither; twentieth-century Italian catholic villagers became Jewish and moved to Israel; and twenty-first century American communities performed their boundaries through dating web-sites in which Judaism became a strategic part of courtship displays. Fellows also discovered the joys of crossing the boundaries between their subjects, boundaries that, however stable they might be elsewhere, at the Katz Center proved quite permeable. The result was a year that transformed—or at least complicated—whatever we thought we meant, not only by “Judaic,” but also by “Christian” and “Islamic.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: right\">David Nirenberg\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ecclesia-ex-circumcisione-and-ecclesia-ex-gentibus\">”Ecclesia ex circumcisione” and “Ecclesia ex gentibus”\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>David Satran\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/sta-sabina.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>At the heart of the “crisis of identity” of emergent Christianity lies the question of the relationship of the new faith with the Jewish community from which it emerges. While the earliest followers of Jesus were Jews in terms of ethnic descent and ritual practice, the survival of the early Church (and the fortunes of Christianity in the Roman world ) ultimately depended on the rapidly growing number of converts from “the nations” gentiles or pagans, in Christian discourse. Eloquent witness to this tension can be found already in the letters of the apostle Paul and its reverberations in subsequent theology and exegesis.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Visual testimony to this seminal ideal of a dual source of new believers may be offered by a very intriguing pair of female figures in the Church of Santa Sabina all’Aventino in Rome. Over the cypress doors of the church, there is a dedicatory mosaic (recording the building of the church by Peter the Illyrian in the early fifth-century C.E.) which is flanked by two women who bear the titular subscriptions ecclesia ex circumcisione (“The Church from the Circumcision”) and ecclesia ex gentibus, (“The Church from the Nations”). Though some scholars have suggested that these figures are the Old and New Testaments, it seems far more likely that they are intended to represent the two sources of the Church: Christians of Jewish origins and the Christians who were converts from pagan backgrounds. What these striking female figures most definitely should not be confused with is the later medieval representation of the antinomy between Church and Synagogue.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"maimonides-dalalat-al-hairin-the-guide-of-the-perplexed\">Maimonides, Dalalat al-Ha’irin, “The Guide of the Perplexed”\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Ayala Eliyahu\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/4795_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"See this leaf in the context of Penn&#x27;s Cairo Genizah Site\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>This manuscript from the CAJS collection was found in the Cairo Genizah, a unique collection of manuscripts found in Fustat (old Cairo) in the second half of the 19th century. These manuscripts, mostly written in Judaeo-Arabic (Arabic in Hebrew letters with many Hebrew expressions), come essentially from the 9th to the 13th century. They belong to various literary genres, thus revealing unknown aspects of the daily life and literary creation of the Jewish communities represented in the Genizah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fustat was the home of the author of this manuscript, one of the leading figures of Judaism - Moses Maimonides (Cordoba 1138 - Fustat 1204). His Dalalat al-Ha’irin, “The Guide of the Perplexed,” is one of the most important books of medieval Jewish philosophy. Written in Judaeo-Arabic, it aims to present a philosophical interpretation of Judaism to the intellectual Jewish reader.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Despite Maimonides’ central place in Jewish thought and \u003Cem>Halacha,\u003C/em> some historical sources have reported that he had been forced to convert to Islam in his youth, when living under the rule of the Almohads, who ruled Spain and North-Africa. After living openly as a Muslim and secretly as a Jew for several years, Maimonides left the Almohad lands, visited \u003Cem>Erez Israel\u003C/em> and finally settled in Fustat.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The case of Maimonides, if he indeed converted, was not isolated: many Jews converted to Islam in the Islamic lands. Some of them were forced to convert, others converted out of belief in Islam, and others probably found it more comfortable to be Muslims. The philosopher and physician Abu’l Barakat al-Baghdadi, an older contemporary of Maimonides (d. 1164-5), was one of these converts. The historical sources give contradictory reports of his conversion, which was probably motivated by convenience reasons. Like Maimonides, Abu’l Barakat does not refer to his conversion in his writings. However, further research of the relationship between his philosophical book (Al-Kitab Al-Mu’tabar) and his commentary to \u003Cem>Kohelet\u003C/em> might shed some light on his attitude towards philosophy and religion, and perhaps give a clue for understanding his conversion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"r-eleazar-ben-judah-of-worms-and-his-regimens-of-reconversion\">R.

In a treatise entitled Moreh Hattaʾim/Sefer Kapparot, which was reproduced in the parallel early fourteenth-century Provencal compendia, Sefer Orhot Hayyim le-Aharon ha-Kohen mi-Lunel and in the anonymous Sefer Kol Bo (extant in some fifteen manuscripts), Eleazar presented a penitential regimen for a Jew who had converted to Christianity and now wished to return to the Jewish community.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In order not to dissuade this reverting Jew, Eleazar is relatively mild in the physical discomforts and afflictions that he recommends. Crucial to this regimen, however, are two highly symbolic and suggestive acts: the reverting Jew must restrain himself from entering a church and even from talking to priests and clergymen at the entrance way, and he must immerse himself in a ritual bath. These actions were intended by Eleazar to serve as a kind of “unbaptism,” and to sever substantive ties with the Christian community, as an essential part of the process of expiation and re-acceptance into the Jewish community.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"a-converso-theologian-alonso-de-cartagena\">A Converso Theologian: Alonso de Cartagena\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Claude Stuczynski\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/stuczynski364.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Contemporary scholarship has endorsed with increasing frequency the claim that sincere and fervent converts from Judaism to Christianity on the Iberian Peninsula developed a distinctive \u003Cem>Converso\u003C/em> theology. By this account, \u003Cem>Converso\u003C/em> theology, even as it completely accorded with Catholic faith and ritual, also emphasized the positive and central role played by Jews and Christians of Jewish descent in the history of Mankind’s Salvation, as represented by figures like the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ and St. Paul. \u003Cem>Converso\u003C/em> theologians have been recognized for diminishing the responsibility of the Jews in the crucifixion, claiming that Romans were also to be blamed. Moreover, the crucifixion was described as part of God’s plan to redeem humanity, a reading based on St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, chapter 11.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Alonso de Cartagena (1384-1456), the distinguished Bishop, diplomat, historian, courtier and precursor of Spanish humanism, was one of the major figures among these \u003Cem>Converso\u003C/em> theologians. As the second son of the converted Rabbi Salomon Halevi of Burgos / Pablo de Santa Maria, he was baptized with his father and his brethren at the age of five, and became one of the most illustrious members of the Santa Maria clan that included writers, historians, soldiers, courtiers, theologians and churchmen. Cartagena continued his father’s path as Bishop of Burgos and also elaborated on the idea that Santa Maria family were scions of both the tribe of Levi and of the Virgin Mary. His \u003Cem>Converso\u003C/em> theology was mainly expressed in his Defensorium unitatis christianae (1449-50): a tract that successfully reacted against anti-\u003Cem>Converso\u003C/em> measures adopted by 1449’s Toledo rebels. Cartagena, elaborated on the Pauline-based theological-political concept of the “Mystical Body” (\u003Cem>Corpus Mysticum\u003C/em>), claiming that \u003Cem>Conversos\u003C/em> are to be considered as full members of the Church, and that any attempt to segregate them on an ethnic or racial basis is an un-Christian “pagan heresy.” Nonetheless, a close reading of Cartagena’s writings shows that he had difficulties reconciling theological views such as St. Paul’s ideas on inclusive Christian equality “neither Jew nor Greek” Galatians 3:28) with beliefs in collective common traits (e.g., the mildness of the Jews vs. the courage of the Goths), as well as regarding St. Paul’s recognition of Jewish Christ believers as a distinct part of the Christian body (I Corinthians 12:12-14).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"pablo-de-santa-maría-and-his-scrutinium-scripturarum\">Pablo de Santa María and his Scrutinium scripturarum\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Yosi Israeli\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/israeli900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Pablo de Santa María (or Shlomo Halevi by his prior name) is regarded as one of the most radical and astonishing examples of Jewish conversion to Christianity in the Middle Ages. The conversion of this celebrated Rabbi from Burgos, who joined the Christian clergy and became the bishop of his own home town, captures in many ways the sudden breakdown and mass conversions of Iberian Jewry that followed the riots of 1391. In the early 1430s, already as a bishop he wrote a twofold dialogue between a Christian and a Jew and between a magister and his recently converted disciple - The Scrutinium scripturarum (Scrutiny of the Scriptures) - in which he presented the theological path that leads from Judaism to Christianity. The Scrutinium provided its readers not only with a scholarly Latin account of the Christian and the Jewish polemical strategies of that crucial time, but also with a bold attempt to use rabbinical literature and Hebrew scholarship as legitimate means for crystallizing Christian truths and with a defense of the spiritual and carnal Israelite origins of Jewish converts to Christianity. Thus, while it was following the guidelines of a catechesis or a missionary handbook, it eventually turned into a best seller mostly because of its contribution to the awaking interest in Hebraic studies in the late 15th century. It was therefore printed during the 1470s in six different editions, including this 1475 Mantua edition by Johannes Schallus. In this sense, the Scrutinium serves as an example to the long-term cultural and intellectual impact that the mass conversions in the Iberian Peninsula and its products had on the Christian world well beyond the Spanish kingdoms.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-invisible-printer-the-hijar-hebrew-bible-incunable-and-the-changing-attitudes-toward-iberian-conversos\">The Invisible Printer: The Hijar Hebrew Bible Incunable and the Changing Attitudes toward Iberian Conversos*\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Javier Castaño\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/castano1200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Five out of ten Hebrew incunabula from the Aragonese print shop at Hijar are editions of the Bible printed between 1486 and 1490. They barely provide us with the names of the printer Eliezer Alantansi, its financier, and the proof-reader, all Jews. We search in vain in the colophons for any reference to the wandering printer and type-cutter Alfonso Fernandez de Cordoba, a Castilian silversmith, whose early known footsteps place him in 1476 Valencia, despite the fact that according to some clues he would have been instrumental in the development of the Hijar print shop.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fernandez de Cordoba’s case may not have been exceptional. As is true for the Hebrew humanist printer Juan de Lucena, we must rely on external documentary sources for indirect hints of Fernandez de Cordoba’s association with Jews involved in printing activities. However, in sharp contrast with Lucena, we still lack conclusive evidence concerning the fact that Fernandez de Cordoba was a \u003Cem>converso.\u003C/em> Both may well exemplify the cultural and social predicament of a generation of \u003Cem>conversos\u003C/em> in a transitional period after the establishment, after 1480, of inquisitional courts that attempted to set clear-cut religious boundaries and taxonomies through the control of the social body and individual consciousness.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Documentary sources frequently associate \u003Cem>conversos\u003C/em> (though not exclusively) with Bible reading in the vernacular, in connection with new forms of religious devotion, and, thus, from an early date we find several initiatives for the printing of vernacular Bibles by \u003Cem>conversos\u003C/em>. In 1476, Fernandez de Cordoba associated with a German craftsman for the production of the \u003Cem>Biblia Valenciana\u003C/em>, a not exceptional case. Two years later, three Aragonese merchants and a notary, all \u003Cem>conversos\u003C/em> that assiduously socialized with their Jewish relatives, contracted with Pablo Hurus in Saragossa for the printing of another Bible in the vernacular. Inquisitorial persecution hampered these initiatives and the copies were promptly destroyed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some developments in the early summer of 1483 in Valencia may be taken into consideration for understanding the background for the establishment, two years later, of a Hebrew print shop at Hijar. For several weeks, the editors in charge of the \u003Cem>Biblia Valenciana\u003C/em>, among them Daniel Vives, the \u003Cem>converso\u003C/em> proofreader, had been interrogated by the inquisitors. Key for the latter was to determine if the proofreader or someone else had checked the vernacular translation with a Hebrew original, or if he knew of any Christian holding a Hebrew Bible. Fernandez de Cordoba had been absent from the city in the previous months, and therefore was not included among those under arrest. However, another source specifies that local authorities were looking after him, and in fact he was surreptitiously in Valencia signing, together with a notary and the Jewish financier Zalmati, the terms for the publication of the works of Bishop Jaime Perez de Valencia. Interestingly enough, the latter’s work was clearly anti-Jewish. Whether this printing was done under duress or not is uncertain, though, in any event, the publication may have contributed to mollifying some ecclesiastical attitudes toward the editors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In addition to securing the financial resources for such a venture, Zalmati appears later on as the financier of the Hijar Hebrew print shop. Collaboration between Fernandez de Cordoba and him was not exceptional, and, thus, in 1484 both appear in charge of the printing of another ecclesiastical work, the \u003Cem>Breviarium Carthaginense\u003C/em> (which, for the first time, contains the seal that will be associated later on with the Hijar Hebrew incunables).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>About the same time, the printer Eliezer Alantansi, scion of a prominent family of Huesca and trained professionally as a physician, had been sent by his relatives to the small town of Hijar in order to prevent his youthful intention of converting to Christianity, according to a testimony brought before the inquisitors some years later. Whether or not we grant any reliability to this information, it is not out of the question that Alantansi’s transfer to Hijar may have contributed to strengthening his Jewish religious convictions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In contrast with the Christian type-cutter mentioned in the Guadalajara 1476 Hebrew incunable colophon, Alfonso Fernandez de Cordoba as well as Juan de Lucena were invisible printers. Following the advent of the Inquisition, the participation of \u003Cem>conversos\u003C/em> in Hebrew print shops became a problematic issue not lacking risks, due to the heretical nature attached to Hebrew culture. Thus, transition to print coincided with a change in the attitudes towards \u003Cem>conversos\u003C/em> that forced them to find new ways to ease their participation in cultural and social common spaces shared by Jews and Christians, among them, printing and reading.

It describes \u003Cem>Rotwelsch,\u003C/em> a secret language prevalent amongst beggars, vagabonds, pedlars and itinerant craftsmen from the Middle Ages onwards. This cant is based on German but has a large proportion of words from Hebrew, Italian, Romani (“Gipsy”) languages, Latin and other languages. The first references to \u003Cem>Rotwelsch\u003C/em> can be found in a text in Medieval High German dating from around 1250. From the 15th century onwards this cant became identified as the language of false beggars and thieves. _Rotwelsch_vocabulary became part of the so called “literature of roguery.” The most famous example of this type of popular literature is the Liber Vagatorum (Book of Vagrants) which was first printed in 1510 and went through many editions and translations. No other than Martin Luther wrote the preface to the 1528 German edition of the Liber Vagatorum.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>About the same time, copycats of this book of rogues appeared under the title Die Rotwelsch Grammatic. The copy in the Van Pelt Library consists of 28 printed pages. The title page shows a woodcut of a man and a woman, clearly dressed as wayfarers. The text is in early modern German. There is a short vocabulary of \u003Cem>Rotwelsch\u003C/em> as well as notes on grammar and language. The text then introduces different types and groups of vagrants. Each carries a \u003Cem>Rotwelsch\u003C/em> name. A special type of fraud already mentioned in the Liber Vagatorum is fraudulent conversion. Especially Christian women were reputed to be such impostors, claiming to have been converted from Judaism. These female cozeners are called \u003Cem>veranerin\u003C/em> in \u003Cem>Rotwelsch.\u003C/em> In French and Italian pamphlets on roguery, fraudsters of this type are known as \u003Cem>convertis\u003C/em> and \u003Cem>iucchi\u003C/em> respectively. The first Hebrew sources on these \u003Cem>rekim\u003C/em>(ריקים, empty people), as Rabbi Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg (c. 1215-1293) called them, date back to the middle of the 13th century. His contemporary, Rabbi Solomon ben Abraham Adret (c. 1235-c.1310), reports that the French rabbinical authorities also had to address the problem of Jews wandering from town to town, posing as Christians to Christians and as Jews when entering the homes of Jews. Since the 15th century, just as the number of fraudulent converts from Judaism began to rise noticeably, the economic condition of converts became linked to the larger discourse on poverty and on crime committed by socially marginal groups. Jewish impostors became part of literary descriptions of the “dangerous classes” (\u003Cem>Gaunerbüchlein\u003C/em>), as in the Liber Vagatorum or the Rotwelsch Grammatic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"johannes-isaac-levita-1515-1577-new-christian-hebraist\">Johannes Isaac Levita (1515-1577), New-Christian Hebraist\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Theodor Dunkelgrün\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/taking-turns/johannes-isaac-levita-1515-1577-new-christian-hebraist?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dunkelgrun1567-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/taking-turns/johannes-isaac-levita-1515-1577-new-christian-hebraist?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/dunkelgrun1581-900.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ytzig ha-Levi, a rabbi from Wetzlar in Hesse, converted to Christianity in 1546 after coming to read the Man of Sorrows in Isaiah 53 as a prophecy of Jesus Christ. He was baptized shortly after Luther’s death in 1546, along with his young son Jacob, by the Lutheran theologian and biblical scholar Johannes Draconites (Drach). Christened Johannes Isaac Levita, he entered the University of Marburg. The Rabbi from Hesse became a Christian in an age of flourishing German Humanism, but also in the midst of a deepening confessional divide that was tearing apart Europe. When Hesse fell to the armies of Charles V in the Schmalkaldic War, Johannes Isaac was brought to the Netherlands to teach Hebrew at Louvain, and converted again, this time to Catholicism. In the early 1550s Johannes Isaac took up the chair of Hebrew at Cologne, where he would teach until his death in 1577. He entered a world hungry for Hebrew learning, but was also cast upon waves of religious warfare, especially when his gifted son Stephan (Jacob), abandoned Catholicism and converted a third time, to the Reformed Church.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some forty years before, Cologne had been a mighty fortress of resistance against the study of Hebrew by Christians and its chief advocate, Johannes Reuchlin. Another Jewish convert, Johannes Pfefferkorn, had infamously tried to persuade the Emperor to round up and burn all Hebrew books in his realm. But Johannes Isaac was a different kind of convert. Rather than fiercely turning on his former coreligionists, as Pfefferkorn had done, Johannes Isaac worked tirelessly to persuade the world of Christian Humanists that the traditions of Hebrew and Jewish scholarship were important, even necessary, to the understanding of Sacred Scripture, of Christianity itself. Johannes Isaac’s appointment to the chair of Hebrew at Cologne was a testimony to the victory of Catholic Biblical Humanism, as an ideal of learning and as a program of education.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Johannes Isaac would publish Hebrew grammars of his own as well as revised and expanded editions of grammars of others. He would also translate classics of Hebrew literature such as Maimonides’ Letter on Astrology and the Sefer Ruah Hen into Latin, serving as a vital intermediary, bridging two different and distant worlds: the Jewish philosophy of Medieval Spain and Egypt, and the Republic of Letters of the Renaissance Humanists. In 1563-64, he was granted a year’s leave of absence to help Christopher Plantin, a French printer established in Antwerp, to put to use the Hebrew types that he had been given on loan by the heirs of the Netherlandish printer in Venice, Daniel Bomberg. These were the very types with which such monuments of Jewish learning—and of Christian Hebrew printing—as the \u003Cem>editio princeps\u003C/em> of the complete Babylonian Talmud and the Rabbinic Bibles had been set. In teaching Hebrew and Aramaic to a generation of Catholic Hebraists at Cologne, and in teaching the staff of a printing shop which would go on to become one of the most important Christian printers of Hebrew in the latter half of the sixteenth century, Johannes Isaac played a pivotal role in the world of Northern Humanism.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Unlike crypto-Jews, who continued to secretly observe Judaism while living outwardly as Christians, Johannes Isaac’s Christian faith, to all appearances, seems to have been real and sincere. If he remained loyal, it was not to the Law of Moses, but to the textual tradition of the Hebrew Bible in a wide and deep sense of the term. In sixteenth century Europe, Johannes Isaac, and like him a small set of deeply learned converted Jewish scholars such as Alfonso de Zamora in Castile, Felix Pratensis and Jacob ben Chaim ibn Adoniya in Venice and Paul Paradis in Paris, played an indispensable role, both in establishing Hebrew as part of the scholarly curriculum of European universities, and in editing editions of the Hebrew Bible printed by Christian printers for a Christian scholarly readership.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Hebraica and Judaica Collections at the University of Pennsylvania preserve two copies of the Tabulae in Grammaticam Hebraeam, one of the most popular Hebrew grammars of the Early Modern period, composed by the path breaking Netherlandish scholar of Greek, Hebrew and Arabic, Nicolas Clenardus or Cleynaerts (1493-1542), in editions that were revised and expanded with commentary by Johannes Isaac. The oldest copy (Cologne, 1567) is at the Library at the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies. The second copy, in the Van Pelt Library Rare Book and Manuscript Library, once belonged to a Jean Merlin, possibly a relative of Jean-Raymond Merlin, the founding professor of Hebrew at the Calvinist Academy of Lausanne (though the latter died three years prior to this publication).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"portuguese-conversos-economy-and-politics\">Portuguese Conversos, Economy and Politics\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Claude Stuczynski\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/taking-turns/portuguese-conversos-economy-and-politics?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/stuczynski2a560.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fig. 1\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/taking-turns/portuguese-conversos-economy-and-politics?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/stuczynski2b560.gif\" alt=\"Fig. 2\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fig. 2\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/taking-turns/portuguese-conversos-economy-and-politics?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/stuczynski2c212.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The mass conversion of Jews in Portugal to Catholicism in 1497, which led to the creation of a \u003Cem>Converso\u003C/em> or New Christian social group within that society, evolved at the precise moment when Portugal became a seaborne empire. Many \u003Cem>Conversos\u003C/em> prospered in this emerging merchant class, becoming dominant in international trade and banking. From the sixteenth century onwards, they were called: “businessmen” or “men of commerce” (“hómens de negócios”), adding a socio-economic stereotype to the religious accusation of being judaizers or “potential Jews.” However, that cliché also served \u003Cem>Conversos\u003C/em> and their sympathizers to claim that Portugal’s prosperity depended on these “men of commerce. ” Therefore, to avoid economical collapse \u003Cem>Conversos\u003C/em> have to be integrated, they argued, into the “Old Christian ” society, including the elites. To attain that goal, prejudices against them, the biased procedures adopted by the Portuguese Inquisition and the juridical ethnic segregation inspired by the “laws of purity of blood ” would have to disappear.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>During the seventeenth century, several tracts imbued with Mercantilism subsumed Iberian economic restoration to \u003Cem>Converso\u003C/em> integration. These pro-\u003Cem>Converso\u003C/em> writings were far from being homogeneous, since beyond diversity of approach, all of them had to reconcile their calls for integration with the recognition that Christians of Jewish descents could be perceived as a separate group, since they were gifted in commerce. Thus, while the Spanish \u003Cem>licenciado\u003C/em> Martín González de Cellorigo (1565?-1630?) [fig. 1] advocated a royal policy of integration of the group, the Portuguese_Converso_ merchant Duarte Gomes Solis (c. 1561- c. 1630) [fig. 2] called to reduce it to a small group of rich New Christian merchants. The great preacher and missionary Jesuit, Father António Vieira (1608- 1697) [fig. 3], was the most persistent and brilliant advocate on behalf of the Portuguese \u003Cem>Conversos.\u003C/em> For him, a real integration of the New Christians into Catholic society was needed both to ensure Portugal’s economic prosperity and to enable that kingdom to fulfill the role of promoting Christian messianic salvation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"richard-bernard-ruths-recompense-or-a-commentarie-upon-the-book-of-ruth-1628\">Richard Bernard, Ruths Recompense: Or A Commentarie upon the Book of Ruth, 1628\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jeffrey Shoulson\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/shoulson900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Richard Bernard (1568-1641) was a moderate Puritan clergyman. Though he flirted at times with separatism, he spent most of his career preaching and practicing a kind of nonconformity within the established English church. He was a prolific writer, publishing more than thirty tracts, treatises, and collected sermons during his lifetime, many of which went through several more printings after his death. His most influential work, a handbook for ministers entitled The Faithfull Shepheard and his Practice, was published first in 1607 and then again, in revised form, in 1621. His allegorical work, The Isle of Man, went through seventeen separate editions between the time of its first publication in 1627 and the end of the eighteenth century. It is believed to have exercised significant influence on, and served as an important precedent for, John Bunyan’s allegorical conversion narrative, The Holy War (1682).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bernard had several connections with the recently established English colonies in North America, as well. During his time in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, he associated with William Brewster and John Robinson, separatists who were involved in the voyage of the Mayflower. His daughter Mary married Roger Williams in 1629 and emigrated with him to New England in 1631, where they eventually founded the colony of Rhode Island.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ruths Recompense is a verse-by-verse commentary on the book of Ruth, collated from sermons Bernard composed and delivered over several years. Like many of his contemporaries, and indeed like Jewish and Christian readers through the centuries, Bernard regarded Ruth as a paradigmatic convert, exemplary in her self-sacrificing faith and commitment to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and to the people of Israel. What made Ruth especially important to Christian readers, of course, was her role within the Davidic line and, therefore, her function as a living ancestor of Christ. Both through her body and through her faith, Ruth’s conversion paved the way for the salvation of the Gentiles. In so doing, however, she also became a critical figure within Christian theories of supersession and the increasingly intense arguments in the 1620s about whether English Protestants should expect, and work for, the “calling of the Jews,” their recovery as God’s (first) chosen people.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bernard dedicated the volume to Lady Frances, the Countess Dowager of Warwick, who had been his patron when he was a young and promising scholar, paying his way at Christ’s College, Cambridge. Christ’s happened to be the college where the most influential Puritan theorist of conversion, William Perkins, served as fellow while Bernard was a student there. Bernard’s reading of Ruth exhibits a significant influence by Perkins, who had developed a morphology of conversion, an approach to conversion as a progression through various inner states of despair and reassurance. In his discussion of Ruth’s conversion it is possible to see Bernard applying Perkins’s \u003Cem>ordo salutis,\u003C/em> “order of salvation,” which was noteworthy for its departure from the rigidly Calvinist idea that man’s will could play no role in his conversion. Bernard celebrates both Ruth’s “calling out of her own people” and her voluntary choice to live a “virtuous life,” in which she exhibited the hallmarks of salvation by being joined “together with members of Christ’s mystical body.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-1661-amsterdam-edition-of-the-ferrara-bible-made-for-a-market-of-new-jews\">The 1661 Amsterdam Edition of the Ferrara Bible: Made for a Market of New Jews\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Anne Oravetz Albert\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/albert900%402x_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>This Spanish Bible is an example of the many books produced especially for newcomers to Judaism in the Sephardi community of seventeenth-century Amsterdam. Most of these immigrants were former _conversos,_descendants of Jewish converts to Catholicism who were escaping from the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal. Although they were not required to convert because they identified themselves as Jewish by ancestry, the adoption of a Jewish lifestyle and participation in the Jewish community required a significant adjustment. Upon arrival, most lacked basic knowledge of Hebrew and Jewish law, and vernacular Bibles like this one were just one element of the copious literature published in Spanish and Portuguese to guide them in their new Jewish practice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The printer of this 1661 edition of the Bible, Joseph Athias, was himself a former \u003Cem>converso,\u003C/em> having been born in Spain and arriving in Amsterdam only as an adult. He is best known for his well-received Hebrew edition produced in the same year, but this edition, a version of the earlier Ferrara Bible newly corrected by Samuel de Cáceres, was explicitly intended for returnees to Judaism. The prologue noted that it would benefit those who were “returning from Spain to the company of the Blessed God,” and the title page, shown here, includes an illustration acknowledging the edition’s intended readers’ status as former \u003Cem>conversos\u003C/em> and their new lives as Jews. It depicts a phoenix, a symbol of the Amsterdam community since it had risen, like the mythical bird, from the ashes of its previous incarnation, i.e., Iberian Jewry. Inside this phoenix appear two groups of travelers embracing, as if they had completed a long journey apart from each other. Just as these estranged travelers met within the breast of the phoenix, so was the Spanish-speaking reader of this Bible presumed to find fellowship with other former \u003Cem>conversos\u003C/em> in Amsterdam.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"der-jude-conversion-and-the-popularization-of-jewish-literature\">Der Jude: Conversion and the Popularization of Jewish Literature\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Pawel Maciejko\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/maciejko900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Der Jude was possibly the first periodical entirely devoted to Jews and Judaism.

In 1768, Selig founded Der Jude, which appeared in weekly installments (every quarter bound into a single volume) till 1772.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All in all, nine quarterly volumes appeared. Numerous scholars and libraries subscribed to the periodical and it fulfilled an important role as a prime means of transmission of knowledge of Jews and Judaism to the learned public. As such, it popularized the accounts of Jewish literature and lore beyond the academic circles of Christian Hebrasists. Selig saw his task as a scientific presentation of Judaism to the wider public; he claimed to have based his publication solely on Jewish sources and devoted considerable attention to correcting mistakes and inaccuracies of Christian scholars.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"reflections-on-ruth-in-grace-aguilars-the-women-of-israel-1887\">Reflections on Ruth in Grace Aguilar’s The Women of Israel (1887)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Sarah Gracombe\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/gracombe900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Part literary biography, part midrash, part conduct book, The Women of Israel likely became the best-known work of the Victorian era’s best-known Anglo-Jewish woman writer, Grace Aguilar. It had a transatlantic life long after its first publication in 1844, as demonstrated by this American edition from 1887, and was praised by both Jewish and Christian reviewers. Indeed, the Methodist periodical Ladies’ Repository particularly lauded this edition for its beauty, something evident in the frontispiece’s delicately entwined lettering and pensive yet strong female figure. The Women of Israel argues for what Aguilar views as the long overlooked importance of such women in the Bible and earlier Jewish history. But it also serves as a “warning” and “example” for Victorian Jews; as Aguilar asserts, “The women of the bible are but mirrors of ourselves.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Reflections of contemporary debates about the compatibility of Jewishness and Englishness are particularly evident in Aguilar’s explication of the Book of Ruth, one that perfectly embodies the opportunities and challenges Ruth’s ambiguous conversion posed in the nineteenth century. On the one hand, Aguilar claims that Ruth “does not properly belong by birth and ancestry to the women of Israel,” a lineal or racial belonging that cannot be erased even after conversion and marriage. On the other hand, Aguilar recognizes that Ruth is “so entwined” with the people she joins that she cannot be ignored.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Reading against the grain, to use an apt harvest metaphor, illuminates how The Women of Israel employs Ruth to consider whether Anglo-Jews can “convert” to Englishness while still preserving ties to their ancestral and religious pasts. Aguilar subtly inverts the original story, aligning the non-Jewish Ruth with Victorian Jews and the Jewish Naomi with Protestant England. This inversion is evident in Aguilar’s repeated emphasis on Ruth’s \u003Cem>choosing\u003C/em> to become a Jew, which makes her “as worthy if not even more so to be the ancestress of David than the lineal descendants of Abraham.” Aguilar lauds the way Ruth “voluntarily engrafted herself upon the children of God … her acceptance of, and obedience to, the Law were entirely \u003Cem>voluntary\u003C/em>; not merely received from education and as heritage.” For Aguilar, Victorian Jews are like Ruth in that they voluntarily chose England and accepted English laws and habits; thus they could be viewed as not only equally but even more worthy of Englishness than those who have “merely” inherited it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What Aguilar’s interpretation reminds us is that representations of Ruth in Victorian culture—and there were many—were written against the backdrop of an expanding England, one struggling with immigration and empire, conversion and emancipation. By privileging choice and faith over blood and race, Aguilar attempts to transform the potentially unsettling fact that Ruth continues to be seen as simultaneously Israelite and Moabite into a model for Anglo-Jews to be both English and Jewish. Her Ruth maintains a degree of difference, yet is emphatically part of the national family, “entwined” with Englishness.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"conversion-in-tsarist-russia\">Conversion in Tsarist Russia\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Ellie Schainker\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/schainker900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Published by the Institutum Judaicum in Berlin for missionary work among Jews under the leadership of H. L. Strak (founded 1883), de le Roi’s pamphlet is the commonly cited source for statistics on Jewish conversions to Christianity in nineteenth-century Europe. This work is particularly valuable, though not necessarily exhaustive, for arriving at a conservative guesstimate of the number of Jewish conversions in imperial Russia to Christian denominations other than Russian Orthodoxy, the legally “preeminent and predominant” church in the empire. De le Roi calculates that 3,136 Russian Jews converted to various Protestant confessions and 12,000 converted to Catholicism. According to this seemingly low estimate, of the approximately 84,500 converts from Judaism, 18% took place outside of the state church, and this percentage can rise as high as 28% if we focus exclusively on civilian conversions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This book is significant for the study of Jewish conversions in the Russian empire for two main reasons. First, though conversion records of Jews abound in imperial archives in the Former Soviet Union, no institution in the empire aside from the Russian Orthodox church maintained yearly statistical records of converts. The Holy Synod, the lay governing body of the Russian Orthodox church, published yearly reports on converts categorizing them by province and former confession. As we lack such aggregate data from the Protestant and Catholic churches in the empire, de le Roi’s work is at least a starting point for considering the extent to which Jews looked outside of the state church for religious conversion. Second, de le Roi’s focus on all Christian conversions is a sound reminder that we risk oversimplification if we understand conversion in the self-consciously multi-confessional and multi-ethnic empire of Russia as a radical expression of Jews becoming “Russian.” Russian Orthodoxy was not identical with imperial subjecthood, and official religious tolerance and institutional supports for the “tolerated foreign confessions” granted Jews a measure of confessional choice when converting. Thus, de le Roi’s statistics on non-Orthodox conversions reminds us that Jewish conversion was not just an act of assimilation to some undefined imperial mainstream devoid of religious significance, and that it pays to consider the ways in which conversion in such an imperial setting was a local, individual affair, influenced by daily inter-confessional sociability and religious influence and access, rather than a “national” and purely instrumental act.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"hymns-of-the-converts-of-sannicandro-garganico\">Hymns of the Converts of Sannicandro Garganico\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Fabrizio Lelli\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/lelli900.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Music played a significant role in the conversion to Judaism of a small group of Catholics in Sannicandro Garganico, a village located in Northern Apulia, Italy. At the end of the 1920s, Donato Manduzio (1885- 1948), a quasi illiterate cobbler, decided to start a new religious movement, possibly inspired by the revelatory and prophetic nature of Protestant confessions that had made proselytes in early twentieth century Southern Italy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In spite of its very strong messianic orientation, Manduzio soon rejected the Christological tradition and stressed instead the literal observance of most of the prescriptions contained in the Pentateuch. When in 1946 his followers and he officially converted to Judaism, a proper ritual had already been established and put into practice in Sannicandro. Services were performed in Italian, and hymns were written either by Manduzio or by the women of the group. After most of the Jews of Sannicandro made \u003Cem>aliyah\u003C/em> in the aftermath of the establishment of the State of Israel, the ritual in Sannicandro came to be performed exclusively by women.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The songs of the Sannicandro Jews were recorded in the 1950s in Israel by Leo Levi (1912-1982). A new recording has been made available by Francesco Lotoro and Paolo Candido, who, in their volume, offer a transcription of the autograph manuscripts of the “Hymnal” of Donato Manduzio and provide new and interesting insights into the importance of music in the Sannicandro community.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-state-of-israels-law-of-return\">The State of Israel’s Law of Return\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Netanel Fisher\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/fishernt.jpg\" alt=\"www.knesset.gov.il: The Law of Return\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"http://www.knesset.gov.il\">www.knesset.gov.il\u003C/a>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901103114/http://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/return.htm\">: The Law of Return\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Law of Return is a symbol and one of the most important laws of the State of Israel. It testifies to the fact that the State perceives itself to be the State of the whole Jewish People. In accordance with this law, the State allows any Jew in the world to enter its territory and almost automatically become a citizen. However, this short and well-known law also embodies the great struggle which has been going on in the Zionist movement for the past hundred years regarding the national Jewish identity:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Law, which was passed in 1950, declared that “Every Jew is eligible to immigrate to Israel.” However, it did not specify how “Jew” was to be defined. One of the reasons for this omission was the secular-national worldview, held by the State’s founders, such as David Ben Gurion, according to which everyone who was willing to be part of the new State of Israel and had either Jewish roots or relatives, could be considered a Jew. One could join the Jewish people by undergoing a period of social and territorial integration.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, since the 1970s the political landscape has changed. The secular-nationalist ideology has weakened, and stronger ties between religion and nationality have taken its place. As a result, the Law of Return was changed, and a Jew was defined as someone whose mother was Jewish or who has converted to Judaism, without clearly stating whether the conversion need be in accordance with Jewish religious law (halakhah) or not. This change has given rise to unending conflicts and disputes, also known as the question of conversion to Judaism, namely: “Who is a Jew” or “Who is a Convert.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Contemporary voices calling for yet another change in the Law of Return, in light of societal and ideological changes in Israel and the Diaspora, reflect the fact that the struggle over the definition of “Jew” and “conversion” to Judaism is still alive and relevant.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Albert, Anne Oravetz.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Post-sabbatian politics : reflections on governance among the Spanish and Portuguese Jews of Amsterdam, 1665-1683.\u003C/em> ((Dissertation: Thesis (Ph.D.): University of Pennsylvania, 2008)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bar-Asher, Mosheh (editor).\u003C/strong> S_hai le-Śarah Yafet : meḥḳarim ba-Miḳra, be-farshanuto uvi-leshono._ Yerushalayim : Mosad Byalik, c2007\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Castaño, Javier.\u003C/strong> “Social networks in a Castilian Aljama and the Court Jews in the Fifteenth Century : A Preliminary Survey (Madrid 1440-1475),” in \u003Cem>la Espania Medieval\u003C/em> (no. 20 (1997)).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Castaño, Javier.\u003C/strong> “Subordinación y parcialidades durante los ‘tiempos rotos’: Mosé Tamaño y el juzgado mayor de la aljama de Ávila,” in \u003Cem>Cristianos y judíos en contacto en la Edad Media: polémica, conversión, dinero y convivencia,\u003C/em> F.

The contributors interpret Jewish domestic culture, architecture, clothing, landscape, and material evidence through the lenses of archaeological, anthropological, historical, legal, literary, and visual research.  Among the topics discussed are Jewish domestic labor, home and homeland, the cosmopolitan home, ghettoized homes, traumatized homes, refugee homes, Soviet Shtetl homes, symbolic homes, embodied homes, health and hygiene, affordable housing, as well as homelessness within the framework of broad social and political contexts. Also treated are Jewish costume and clothing, Jewish domestic customs, including lighting Sabbath candles and inscribing marriage contracts, as well as the homes and hands through which Jewish books have passed. The periods of time covered span the ancient Near Eastern archeological sites of home, the ancient rabbinic home as a worksite, Fatamid Egyptian Jewish home interiors, early modern Jewish households of masters and enslaved people; modern representations of Jewish notions of home and office in the visual arts, including photography and engraving, and studies that approach the home as part of the built environment and design of local neighborhoods.\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### Dr. Erna Meyer, _Wie kocht man in Erez Israel?_\n\nViola Alianov-Rautenberg\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/wie-kocht-man.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nHow to cook in Palestine? This question was addressed in a plethora of publications in the Yishuv of the 1930s. One of the most active participants in this debate was Dr. Erna Meyer. Herself an immigrant from Nazi Germany, she had been a well-known expert on the domestic economy and the rationalization of housework prior to her immigration. Her cookbook _How to Cook in Palestine_ was published in 1936 in Tel Aviv on behalf of the WIZO. It appeared in German, Hebrew, and English. The three languages notwithstanding, its main target group was the newly immigrated women from Nazi Germany. The cookbook provides insights into the norms that women were supposed to follow in the allegedly private realm of housework and nutrition in pre-state Israel.\n\nIn the book, Meyer argues that the newcomers from Germany should overcome their Diaspora-identity through a new way of cooking, thereby becoming entrenched in their new homeland, Palestine. She prompts her readers to acquaint themselves with \"healthy Palestine cooking.\" This cuisine should be based on local food staples (e.g. eggplants and zucchini) instead of European cooking traditions. Meyer also makes it clear that the homemakers were no longer responsible solely for their own family but also for the Yishuv as a whole. In the struggle for supporting the developing national economy of the Yishuv, it was the responsibility of the homemaker to \"vigorously strive to buy local products\" (Tozeret Haaretz).\n\n### Ben Shemen as an emblem of a Jewish Heimat\n\nOfer Ashkenazi\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/ben-shemen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe “youth village” Ben Shemen was designed to be a “home away from home” for Jewish teenagers who had recently immigrated to Mandate Palestine without their parents. The founders, Dr. Siegfried Lehmann, envisioned a new model of national education, which shapes individual and national identity through life and work in the rural landscape of the homeland.\n\nAt first glance, Zoltan Kluger’s photograph of Ben Shemen seems to be off the mark. Not only that the caption is wrong (the village was founded in 1927, not 1925), but the photograph also shows no sign of the features that distinguished the place from other educational institutions: e.g., the children who lived without a family in Palestine; their work in the fields; and the cultural programs that were integrated with the school curriculum. These aspects of the village were indeed underscored in various other photographs and films that documented it in the 1930s and 1940s. Yet Kluger’s image does capture the essence of Lehmann’s vision and understanding of the school. Located on the hill, surrounded by fields and a forest, the village is interwoven into the landscape while towering above it. Compared with the fields, the darker shade of the trees around the school simultaneously indicates the connection with the natural landscape and distinguishes the village from its surrounding. Simply put, in line with Lehmann’s intention, Kluger conceived Ben Shemen as an emblem of a Jewish Heimat: namely, the place that constitutes and displays the authentic bond between a people and its organic, national landscape.\n\n### Between the Home and the Street: Jewish Dress and the Crossing of Boundaries\n\nCornelia Aust\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/franckfurther-jud-und-judin.jpg\" alt=\"Detail\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-07/friedrich-hottenroth4.png\" alt=\"Detail\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nItems of Jewish dress are among the most interesting objects when looking at material culture, though early modern clothes are usually not preserved as objects themselves. Clothes were stored within the home when not used, though for many Jewish men and women there was not much to store. Most certainly had a separate set of clothes for Shabbat and the holidays. Clothes were worn inside and outside of the home, thus, being an object constantly crossing this boundary. Dress played a crucial role in the display of belonging, the positioning of the self within the community and vis-à-vis the other. Thus, dress closely connects Jewish homes with the life outside - within the Jewish quarter or street and on the general market place and city or village streets of early modern Europe.\n\nOne of the sources commonly available to think about early modern Jewish dress are drawings and engravings (usually by non-Jewish artists) like the two displayed here. Presenting Jewish male and female dress from Nuremberg (or rather nearby Fürth as Nuremberg was closed to Jewish settlement) and Frankfurt am Main, both seem to provide a reliable depiction of early modern Jewish dress in the German lands. However, both only give a partial view. Like most drawings and engravings, they are depictions of ideal sets of dress, usually worn on Shabbat. Thus, they depict items such as the ruff or collar and the Shabbat cloak (_shulmantel_), which were not items of daily use. The Frankfurt couple included in the Neu-eröffnete Welt-Galleria of 1703 was a contemporary engraving (by Christoph Weigel), though we do not know who the model for the work was. By the late nineteenth century, Friedrich Hottenroth ventured into a three-volume project of depicting and describing German national costumes. He drew most of the depictions following older originals and descriptions. Interestingly, he mentions, that the woman’s large ruff was still common among Jews and non-Jews at the time. The red heart on the man’s costume, he states, was a specific local stigmatizing mark that Jews had to wear. However, we hardly know how he decided which clothes to depict and how to color them.\n\n### Ruines de Capernaum \\[Ruins of Capernaum\\]\n\nMelissa S. Cradic\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/cradic.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis historical photograph from the Lenkin Family Collection captures remnants of the ancient town of Capernaum (Kefar Naḥum in Talmudic sources, Tanḥum in Medieval sources, and the modern Arabic site name of Talḥum) prior to its excavation and transformation into a Christian pilgrimage site. The image shows the Galilean landscape of 19th century Palestine, riddled with ruins on and below the surface and inviting curiosity about the people who once lived, worked, and died there. Probing the palimpsests of the past, archaeologists excavating at Capernaum have subsequently revealed Roman/Byzantine remains including a richly decorated synagogue built from imported white limestone blocks (visible in the foreground of the image), as well as a modest Jewish fishing village with humble houses constructed from local basalt fieldstones (Tzaferis 1993).\n\nCapernaum and other excavated settlements provide tangible windows into many aspects of “household Judaism” (Berlin 2005) and domestic life in ancient Palestine. Ancient architecture, art, and material culture reveal how Jewish homes in antiquity were spaces for creating and constraining community through access and movement, labor and maintenance practices, ritual observance, foodways, family dynamics, and gender relationships (Meyers 2008)\n\n### Hadar ha-Karmel: a 'garden city' in Haifa\n\nSigal Davidi\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/haifa-hadar-hacarmel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe photo of Hadar ha-Karmel neighborhood in Haifa is part of an album of 88 photos taken by the photographer Zoltan Kluger, in the years 1937-1938 in Palestine under the British Mandate. This collection contains spectacular photos of kibbutzim, moshavim, towns and cities, presenting the development of the Jewish Yishuv after a decade of tremendous waves of European Jews immigration. Kluger was the official photographer for the Zionist institutions Jewish National Fund (JNF) and Keren Hayesod, and this album is part of a large number of photos he took in Mandatory Palestine. \n\nHadar ha-Karmel, or in short Hadar, was established in 1922. It was planned according to the principles of a 'garden city' by the German Jewish architect and town planner, Richard Kauffmann, who was back then the head of the planning department at the Jewish Agency. Hadar ha-Karmel was one of the first Jewish neighborhoods in Haifa, which was, and still is, a mixed city of Jews and Arabs. In the 1920s it was considered the distinct modern neighborhood of Haifa. After the 1929 Arab riots in Palestine, many Jews preferred to live in Hadar rather than in mixed neighborhoods of Jews and Arabs throughout the city. This led to the massive construction of modernist apartment buildings and the accelerated development of the neighborhood. \n\nThe photo shows the modern apartment buildings and a big public park in the heart of Hadar ha-Karmel. The park was established in 1923 for the welfare of the neighborhood's residents. In 1925 the park was named \"Gan Binyamin\" after Baron Benjamin Edmond James de Rothschild, on the occasion of the Baron's visit to Haifa. The buildings and the park shown in the photo still exist today.\n\n### A Glimpse into the Jewish Cosmopolitan Home in the Early Modern Venetian Ghetto\n\nFederica Francesconi\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/historia-de-riti-hebraici-titlepg2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn both of its first editions (1637 and 1638), _Historia de riti hebraici_  by the celebrated Venetian rabbi Leone Modena (1571-1648) is known for its exploration of Judaism as a rational and enlightened religious system and the Jews as civilized residents who deserved to at least be tolerated within Christian society. Yet, less known are its descriptions of Jewish daily life in contemporary Venice. Indeed, in Venice despite ghettoization many Jews felt at home. His portrait on the frontispiece of _Historia de riti hebraici_ shows Modena bare-headed. Leone Modena was willing to adopt the Italian social habit to remove one’s hat before Christians of honor instead of following the Jewish custom of covering of the head. Yet this portrait tells us something also about the Jewish home in the ghetto: Venetian Jews commissioned their own portraits quite often and more than elsewhere in both the contemporary Sephardi and the Ashkenazi worlds. In affluent Venetian Jewish homes, the _portego_ (the typical hall) was often decorated with still life paintings (_nature morte_), decorative wall hangings (_arazzi_), gilded leathers (_cuori d’oro_), and portraits.\n\nThe Jewish home in early modern Venice was as a space that opens onto an extensive social and cultural network of Jewish refugees of Sephardi origins, displaced after the medieval Jewish expulsions, along with Italian and Ashkenazi Jews as well as victims of slave-hunting corsair galleys that roamed throughout the Mediterranean. The latter could include Jews and Catholics, black sub-Saharan animists and Muslims, Christian Protestants and Orthodox, both men and women (mentions at 8-9, 37). Indeed, _Historia de riti hebraici_ documents certain aspects of the reality of the ghetto in early-modern Venice and the cohabitation of Jewish families with Christian and Jewish servants and black slaves, who at the time were sold in the Barbary regencies (the centers of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli), the independent kingdom of Morocco, and the east (the “Levant”) from Cairo to Constantinople (110).\n\nOnce transported to Venice, the preeminent occupation for black African slaves would have been domestic service. Manumission was a recurrent stage or an event in their life course and in the ghetto it happened through circumcision for men and immersion into the _mikveh_ (ritual bath) for both men and women (110). Black Africans never constituted more than a very small minority of the slave populations of the cities of Italy. Rationales for their subjugation on the basis of skin color did not take hold as they did in Spain and Portugal. Slaves and servants also functioned as a symbol of status. Many Venetian Jews probably shared the view of a Leone Modena’s responsum that contemporary slaves were more like employees than possessions: “Nowadays, when our servants are held by us as comrades and not as slaves, as they were wont to term them in the past, we will not put them to harsh work. (_Ziknei Yehudah_, Venice 1650, no. 34).” Ultimately, Leone Modena’s _Historia de riti hebraici_ as well as his and other contemporary Venetian rabbis’ responsa capture the complexity and alterity of the Jewish household and the broader Jewish society that in Venice were less prone to exclusivity, purification, and purgation than other early-modern religious and ethnic communities.\n\n### The Jewish Home in Fatamid Egypt\n\nMiriam Frenkel\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/ashmolean.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe Jewish house in the lands of Islam during the high middle ages (10 th -13 th centuries) was void of any heavy wooden furniture of the kind known in Christian Europe. It was textiles of all kinds, measures and forms which furnished the house. Curtains, rugs, mats, cushions, and mattresses substituted for chairs, tables and beds. This was part of the _bon ton_ in furnishing Jewish, as well as the Muslim and Christian homes. Spaciousness was the desirable look of a home and it was achieved by this roominess. The Fatimid textiles were known for their high quality and unique artistic design. Many of them are mentioned in wedding lists from the Cairo Geniza as part of the bride\\`s trousseau, which will furnish her future home.\n\nIn the picture is a typical piece of Fatimid textile kept at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. It is linen, embroidered with colored silk. It depicts two bands of birds set into arches. Note the vivid colors of the birds that vary between red, blue, and yellow. A varied spectrum of colors is similarly used to describe the variegated textiles mentioned in trousseaux lists from the Cairo Geniza.\n\n### On the Couch between Trauma and Home\n\nKeren Friedman-Peleg\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/woman-with-couch.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis photo was taken by the highly acclaimed Israeli photographer, Alex Levak, in Jerusalem in 1996, across from the Kings Hotel. The image appears in Levak’s book, _Our Country_, published four years later, and is reproduced here with his permission. When viewed from a wide perspective, paying attention to the context in which a woman is dragging a heavy couch, this image is rich with Jewish-Israeli collective symbols of home and belonging. The location is at one of Jerusalem’s most iconic intersections, where the modern neighborhood of Rehavia in West Jerusalem meets the historical past of Jerusalem’s Old walled city, and where the Great Synagogue of Jerusalem stands just a few meters away. The image invites the viewer to reflect on the profound meaning attached to this place. The Kings Hotel was among the first to be built in Jerusalem after the establishment of Israel in 1948; the Great Synagogue was dedicated to the memory of the six millions Jews who perished in the Holocaust and to the fallen soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces; Rehavia is a neighborhood associated with German-Jewish culture, and with upper-class Ashkenazi Jews.\n\nYet, when we return our attention to the woman right at the middle of the image, the concepts of home and belonging shift from their collective and solid, even glorified and poetic, meanings, into much more fluid, flexible and negotiable ones. Crossing King George Street with this very heavy couch, this woman seems to be in the middle of a heroic effort to arrive, to find—to arrive and to find—a place, a place to settle down; a place where she can put the heavy couch she has just found, a couch on which to sit, to rest, to feel a degree of safety and comfort. As a sort of counter-narrative to all the collective symbols surrounding her, this woman, with this heavy couch, provides an individual, improvised, practical and casual meaning to these wonderful concepts: home and belonging.\n\n### Jewish Sabbath Candles for Latin readers: Willem Surenhusius's edition of the Mishnah\n\nGregg E. Gardner\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-07/gardner2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nWhat makes a home a _Jewish_ home? It is often the objects inside the home and how they are used that help create and define a distinctly Jewish space. One of the most well-known household objects associated with characteristically Jewish rituals is a set of candlesticks for fulfilling the obligation to kindle two lights on Friday evening to mark the onset of the Sabbath. The origins of the custom are unclear; later rabbinic interpreters would attribute it to two biblical passages—one candle to mark the instruction in Exodus 20:8 to “remember” the Sabbath, the other to mark Deuteronomy 5:12’s precept to “observe” the Sabbath. There is little evidence, however, that this was understood as a religious obligation before the Hellenistic or early Roman age. By the first century CE, we have writings from Roman onlookers testifying that Jews light oil lamps—which were used before candles—to mark the onset of the Sabbath. As they did with many rituals that had been only vaguely or sporadically followed beforehand, the early rabbis would take up lighting, elevate it to religious obligation, and discuss it in detail. Most notably, we see this in the Mishnah, the earliest work of rabbinic law (dating to the third century CE), particularly tractate Shabbat, chapter 2. The level of interest in even the most minute detail of these laws is exemplified by the rabbis’ discussions of the permissible kinds of oils and materials for wicks.\n\nThe figure at left shows a Hebrew-Latin edition of the Mishnah, translated by Willem Surenhusius (c.1664 –1729) a Dutch Christian scholar of Hebrew, and printed between 1698 and 1703. It includes commentary by traditional rabbinic thinkers (Maimonides, Bertinoro), as well as early modern Christian scholars. Translating the Mishnah into Latin made its teachings—and rabbinic thought—accessible to a broader audience of thinkers, historians, and theologians. Indeed, the earliest rabbis' thoughts and ideas on lighting Sabbath lamps, as well as an array of laws on other areas of socio-religious thought, would reach a far broader audience and have far more influence within Judaism than the third-century rabbis could have anticipated.\n\n### Spindle whorls: the Jewish home as worksite\n\nPratima Gopalakrishnan\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/spindle-whorl.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis item is one of 55 at the Penn Museum that is marked as “spindle whorl” and dated to the period of Roman rule in Judea. All 55 items are from Penn’s archaeological expedition in Beth Shean during the 1920s. Spindle whorls are disc- shaped objects with a hole in them, and they are attached to the spindle rod to provide weight and momentum as fiber was spun into yarn. Spindle rods were made of wood, and therefore disintegrate, but since spindle whorls were made of materials like ivory, glass, and bone, they survive in the archaeological record.\n\nThese items reflect the ubiquity of spinning in the ancient household. The ancient home was not a refuge from work, but rather a site of work. This is especially true of textile work. A great variety of textile products, destined for a variety of uses, were produced and traded throughout the Roman Empire. Spinning represented a major bottleneck within the process of textile production since it was extremely labor- intensive work. Spinning was ever-present work, the work free and enslaved women in the household could not escape. The _bayit_ was not the site of decommodified work hermetically sealed from the market, but rather the social unit that regulated free and enslaved women’s work for that market.\n\n### Homeless in Their Home/Land: Mizrahis, Gender and Law in Israel\n\nClaris Harbon\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/homeless.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nAs if happening these days in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1959, in Wadi Salib a former Palestinian neighborhood in Haifa, a community of Moroccan Jews led by David Ben Harosh rebelled against their systemic oppression and racism inflicted by Ashkenazi establishment. They were crushed by the police, the courts and the public. In this picture, here a young man holds the flag of Israel. What you cannot see here are two important things: first, the flag is stained with blood, and second it had a profound sentence written on it: “Hassan King of Morocco, Take Us Back”. Let us briefly reflect on this short and yet deep sentence. These people, all Moroccan Jews, were probably all traditional/Masortim, for whom Israel was their home and refuge from the Diaspora. They are now asking the Muslim King, from whom they were taken away, usually indoctrinated to believe that he was their enemy, to take them back. They want to go back to the Diaspora. לחזור לגלות. This begs many questions, but one common thread: a sense of alienation and diasporic identity has been created persisting nowadays, at that exact home, where diaspora was meant to end. Corresponding with the subject and themes of my research, this is translated into a sense of temporality, destruction. Of defeatism. Of people who do not feel any affiliation to their homes.\n\nIn my work I offer a new understanding of the role of ‘home,’ particularly public housing in Israel, as a site of both oppression, dispossessing Mizrahis of their homes and homeland, culminating in instilling feelings of homelessness, and of resistance and agency, even reconciliation, generating defiant memories and social justice, redefining Israeli property laws. A home as a project of both memory and forgetting.\n\n### On Jewish anthropology, ethnographic serendipity and materiality of the Soviet _shtetl_\n\nAnna Kushkova\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/removable-ceiling.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis small episode of my ethnographic field life happened in July of 2008, in a small Ukrainian town of Bershad. Situated in the historic region of Podolia, one of the major destination areas of Semion An-sky’s expeditions in the early 20th c., Bershad was a town where St. Petersburg Judaica Center, of which I was then part, conducted ethnographic research in the post-Holocaust Jewish survivor communities.\n\nOn that day as I was walking along one of the town streets, and one uninhabited run-down Jewish house, one of many of such kind, somehow drew my attention. I jumped over the low fence and crawled into the house through what once was the door.\n\nMy intuition did not deceive me: this house contained probably one of the last extant **removable ceilings** – a distinct feature of local Jewish architecture. In this area shtetl houses were built so close to each other that there was no space for an outside sukkah. So, Jews were using their verandas for that purpose, with ceilings removed for the holiday.\n\nThe ceiling I discovered was composed of 6 squares (one already missing), attached above an outside verandah.\n\nNeedless to say, this particular architectural contraption proved to be extremely useful under the late Soviet regime: one could celebrate Sukkoth (_Sikes_ in Ukrainian Yiddish) not being observed by the watchful eye of the local Soviet authorities – or nosy neighbors.\n\nTherefore – since the house itself was most probably built in the early 20 th c. – one can safely say that this removable ceiling presents a concise symbol of the Jewish life that went on even in the most adverse circumstances, of the grass-root resistance to the anti-religious ethos of the state and its anti-Semitic policies, as well as of the creativity mobilized by Soviet Jews for this.\n\n### Cheap Houses: Building affordable, hygienic housing in Warsaw and Vilna\n\nCecile E. Kuznitz\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/apartment-block.jpg\" alt=\"Detail\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/daycare-recreation.jpg\" alt=\"Detail\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century urbanization and industrialization led to rapid population growth in the cities of the Russian Empire, as elsewhere in Europe. As the development of urban infrastructure lagged reformers grew increasingly alarmed by a lack of affordable, hygienic housing. One of the most ambitious and successful projects to address this concern was the initiative of the Jewish banker and philanthropist Hipolit Wawelberg (1843-1901). In 1897 Wawelberg decided to “provid\\[e\\] working people with cheap, hygienic, and civilized housing” in the outlying Wola neighborhood of Warsaw. He erected three large blocks with modern apartments as well as auxiliary buildings housing amenities including baths, a day care, a clinic, and a room for “decent entertainment.” Wawelberg hoped this complex would “foster mutual respect and tolerance” between Jewish and Christian Poles and mandated that residents be drawn equally from both groups.\n\nThese so-called “cheap houses” inspired a similar project in Vilna the following year and a second nearby development in Warsaw in 1925. Yet their success was tempered by high construction and maintenance costs, which led to less profitability and more crowded conditions than anticipated. Moreover, few Jews chose to inhabit the apartments, thwarting Wawelberg’s goal of promoting Jewish-Christian co-existence. These buildings created comfortable and sanitary homes for poor Warsaw residents and a new kind of community that encompassed public health, social welfare, and cultural functions. Yet Jews’ failure to feel at home there suggests the difficulty of creating true integration on the intimate level of domestic space.\n\n### Yoma: Footprints of a Jewish Book\n\nMarjorie Lehman\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/callnumber.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-home/yoma-footprints-jewish-book?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/binding.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-home/yoma-footprints-jewish-book?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/detail.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-home/yoma-footprints-jewish-book?item=2)\n\nBetween 1519 and 1523 the first complete editions of the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds were printed in Italy. An entrepreneur from Antwerp, Daniel Bomberg (b. 1483) had made a significant business decision, opening a printing house in Venice. Printed copies of the Talmuds sold well. The printing house also became a meeting place for Jews and non-Jews to share printing skills, business acumen and ideas. The strong desire on the part of Jews—some to study and some to own a material copy of the Talmud--generated the need for second, third and fourth printings. Many of the copies, which were often purchased volume-by-volume, outlived their owners, passing hands many times. They continually entered new homes, becoming increasingly valuable over time. The Library of the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies has become the home to many of these Bomberg volumes, each copy with its own story, each possessing information attesting not only to the movement of Jewish books across the globe, but to individuals who owned, read, bought, sold and gifted them.\n\nMany of the Bomberg Talmud copies owned today by the Katz Center once belonged to the great book collector and native of Philadelphia, Mayer Sulzberger (b. 1843). After his death in 1923 they found a new home in the library of Dropsie College. Due to financial strains, Dropsie became the Annenberg Research Institute in 1986 and then merged with Penn in 1993, becoming the Center for Judaic Studies. It was renamed the Center for Advanced Judaica Studies in 1998, and now is the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies.\n\nThe copy of _Masekhet Yoma_ displayed here took a different path from Sulzberger’s collection. It came from the personal library of Samuel Tobias Lachs who was a professor of Religion at Bryn Mawr College for most of his career. He received his AB from the University of Pennsylvania in 1946 and his PhD from Dropsie College in 1958. Upon his death in 2000, his wife, G. Phyllis Lachs, presumably because of her husband’s connection to Penn and Dropsie, donated some of her husband’s most valuable books to the Katz Center. Included was this copy of _Yoma_, several other volumes of the Bomberg Talmud as well as Lachs’ unfinished scholarly works.\n\nIn its new home, Lachs’ copy of _Yoma_ connects us to his life, his love of Jewish books, and to his devotion to scholarship in the field of rabbinics. It is also a testament to the fact that Jewish Studies has found a home at major research universities, building scholarly communities around the availability of valuable resources. The care that has been taken to preserve this copy of _Maskekhet Yoma_, including the clues to its past homes, is evident in a note found inside its pages with the name of Abraham Moses Luncz. It is not clear whether Lachs and Luncz had a familial relationship, nor can we be sure that this copy of _Yoma_ was in Luncz’s possession. However, this piece of paper brings us to the home of Luncz, another book lover who lived in Jerusalem from 1868 until his death in 1918. He ran a printing press during his lifetime. An article written about him in the Jewish Encyclopedia reports that in 1904 he was involved in printing an edition of the Jerusalem Talmud, a sure reflection of his interest in Jewish books and a sign that he might have owned this volume of _Yoma_.\n\nThis copy of _Yoma_ is only one example of the many books at the Katz center, each with a history waiting to be told. As a present co-director of a recent collaborative digital humanities project that tracks the pathways of copies of Jewish books, _Footprints: Jewish Books through Time and Place_ ([https://footprints.ctl.columbia.edu](https://footprints.ctl.columbia.edu/)), we are now able to record all of the traces of the past homes of Jewish books. The database aggregates all of this information revealing the intersections between the people who owned Jewish books and the places they called home. As a result, the database enriches the history of Jewish life and culture from the beginning of print until the present day.\n\n### Jewish house inscriptions in the Art of Moritz Oppenheim\n\nNathaniel Riemer\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/oppenheim.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nOf course - the works of Moritz Oppenheim are quoted so often that it is completely old- fashioned to use them one single time again: The stereotypically recurring elements of his pictorial language seem kitschy to us and are no longer capable of arousing any kind of nostalgic feelings. Oppenheim's oeuvre is nevertheless important for my research. His pictures show objects that were sorted out of the Jewish culture or whose meaning changed radically. These include Jewish house inscriptions. In some of the Jewish artist's works they occasionally appear in the margins. Readable only with a magnifying glass, they have changed their content, their spatial positioning and function. In which of his other paintings could you find those modified “house inscriptions”?\n\n### Jewish Wedding Ideals and the Symbolic Home in a Remote Community\n\nShalom Sabar\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/Sabar%2C%20Shalom%20%28image%20for%20web%20exhibit%20-%20Zucker%20006%20-%20062520%29.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n**Kurdish Ketubah from Zakho (Iraqi Kurdistan), 1910**\n\nThis cheerful and naively decorated small ketubah from the superb Zucker Family Collection of Jewish marriage contracts, now being digitized by the Penn Libraries, attracted my attention from the first time I saw it. The reason is not surprising. It bears a striking resemblance to a ketubah hanging in our living room – a ketubah presented to me years ago by my late father when he learned that I was writing a thesis on the history of the ketubah and its illustration. This was no ordinary ketubah he gave me. It belonged to his parents, my grandparents, who both passed away when I was a child, a few years after the entire Jewish community of Zakho in Iraqi Kurdistan (northern Iraq) immigrated to the young State of Israel. The ketubah of my grandparents, inscribed and witnessed in Zakho in 1912, was obviously created by the same anonymous scribe and folk artist responsible for the present attractive document (Zucker Ketubah 6).\n\nAccording to oral traditions, the Jews of Kurdistan claim they are descendants of the Ten Tribes who first arrived in this area after the Assyrian conquest of the Northern Kingdom of Israel (722 BCE). In fact, in this and every other Zakho ketubah, the city is described as situated on the bank of the river Khabour (כאן במתא זאכו דעל נהר כאבור יתבא), a tributary of the Euphrates. Zakho Jews believed this is the same river called חבור (Ḥabor) mentioned in the Bible (2 Kings 17:6), and identify their hometown with one of the sites to which the Israelites were exiled with the fall of the Northern Kingdom in the time of King Hoshea. Moreover, the Jews of Zakho, as many other Jewish communities of Kurdistan, speak a dialect of the ancient Aramaic language (often called Neo-Aramaic). The word for the bridal canopy (_ḥupah_) in our dialect is גנוניה (_genunei_) the \\_s\\_ame Aramaic term used in the Talmud (e.g., Nedarim 50b). The biblical word _ḥupah_ (e.g., Joel 2:16) certainly implies a room where the bridal couple were united for the first time. While in other Jewish communities the _ḥupah_ became a symbolic canopy raised over the bridal couple, Kurdish Jews preserved the ancient custom and made it as a room – a beautifully decorated bridal chamber with colorful woven fabrics, where the newlywed spent the seven days of the wedding festivities together (with a child seated between them) and guests came to visit them. This room thus served not only as a symbol of the wedding and fertility, but the actual “first home” of the groom and bride.\n\nThe contents of the dowry (some of it bought by the _mohar_ or bride’s price raised by the groom’s family) brought to the couple’s new home is detailed at length in the ketubah. The list appears in the middle of the page written in a different colored, light ink. Each item is mentioned by its name in the local dialects (written in Hebrew letters). The monetary value of each item is written below it in Arabic numerals. The practice was for all the dowry items to be presented publicly on the wedding day for appraisal by experts. The _Ḥakham_ would then inscribe the stated values, one by one, in front of all those present, onto the space on the page left for this purpose by the community’s expert scribe, who had drawn up the ketubah in advance. Finally, the community’s and the bridal couple’s expectations of what ideally should “fill” their new home is expressed in the wish that God will grant them “honest and respectable offspring, who observe the Torah and the commandments.”\n\n### Inspiring Jewish Collectivism\n\nKatherine Sorrels\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/sorrels.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis text by the Welsh thinker and industrialist Robert Owen (1771-1859) is a radical proposal for socialist reform. Owen ran a mill based on socialist principles, guaranteed his workers’ jobs, and provided for their children’s education. He envisioned self-governing communities in which workers owned the means of production, essentials were distributed, and women had equal rights. This text is an 1821 a proposal for a cooperative based on these principles in Scotland. The most famous of his initiatives was New Harmony, a community established in Indiana in 1825. It survived only four years, but is regarded as a foundational experiment in the tradition of utopian socialism.\n\nIndeed, Owen’s ideas inspired Jewish refugees from Nazi Vienna, who fled to Scotland in 1938 and established an intentional community to care for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities in which the staff lived together with students, received no payment for their work, and distributed resources according to need. Their experiment far outlived the one at New Harmony. The first community, called Camphill Special School, grew into an international movement of over 130 Camphill and Camphill-inspired communities around the world. The mission to provide a shared sense of home for abled and disabled community members has sustained the movement for eighty years.\n\n### Ma’aseh Tuviah: Jews, Bodies, Health, and Houses\n\nJoshua Teplitsky\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-07/tep.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nPlague in early modern Europe was a disease of the house (Snowden, 42). Its transmission by fleas meant that domestic living conditions were a crucial factor in the spread of illness. An array of sources from the period reflect this understanding, even if the microbiological underpinnings of disease transmission were not established until the late nineteenth century: state archives preserve documents ordering the cleaning of houses, the separation of individuals, and concern over objects within the home; religious texts debated the merits of flight versus home isolation; and medical textbooks offered wisdom about treatment and prevention through home remedies.\n\nA touchstone of scholarly exploration of Jewish medical knowledge in the early modern period, the book _Ma’aseh Tuviyah_ is an apt artefact for thinking about Jews, bodies, health, and houses. First published in 1707, the book’s metaphorical rendition of a human body as a house offers a visual representation of the theme of this seminar year (Lepicard, 229-255). The second volume of the work, first published in Jessnitz in 1720, bore a sub-section entitled “Mishmeret ha-Bayit” \\[The Watch of the House\\]--meant to invoke both the body as house and the importance of the home itself—which deals largely with forms of illness.\n\nThis text offers a powerful, yet common, example of the importance of house and home in the history of disease in Jewish life. The author deals with types of illnesses—including plague “that most fearful of all illnesses”—and considers the medical commonality between Jews and non-Jews both in their experiences and by drawing together Jewish and non-Jewish sources. The work thus represents a valuable window into thinking about body and house as the locus for prevention, treatment, and cure, as well as our understandings of Jews as they related to their neighbors in early modern Europe.\n\n### Freud’s Uncanny Home Office\n\nLiliane Weissberg\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/freud.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nIn 1919, Sigmund Freud published an essay that focuses on the term _heimlich_, that designates what belongs to a home, and on its counterpart, _unheimlich_ or “uncanny.” They turn into central notions of psychoanalysis. In 1938, then, the photographer Edmund Engelman enters Freud’s own home and office, to document these spaces shortly before Freud’s emigration to England. Engelman’s record shows a medical practice that is part private museum, part bourgeois living room. This room, with the couch at its center, is part of Freud’s home and it is not. It turns into the central locus of psychoanalysis and its practice. On the shelf to the right of the couch, among various pictures and antiquities, he placed two kiddush cups.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Alianov-Rautenberg, Viola.** \"Migration und Marginalität.

The contributors interpret Jewish domestic culture, architecture, clothing, landscape, and material evidence through the lenses of archaeological, anthropological, historical, legal, literary, and visual research.  Among the topics discussed are Jewish domestic labor, home and homeland, the cosmopolitan home, ghettoized homes, traumatized homes, refugee homes, Soviet Shtetl homes, symbolic homes, embodied homes, health and hygiene, affordable housing, as well as homelessness within the framework of broad social and political contexts. Also treated are Jewish costume and clothing, Jewish domestic customs, including lighting Sabbath candles and inscribing marriage contracts, as well as the homes and hands through which Jewish books have passed. The periods of time covered span the ancient Near Eastern archeological sites of home, the ancient rabbinic home as a worksite, Fatamid Egyptian Jewish home interiors, early modern Jewish households of masters and enslaved people; modern representations of Jewish notions of home and office in the visual arts, including photography and engraving, and studies that approach the home as part of the built environment and design of local neighborhoods.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"dr-erna-meyer-wie-kocht-man-in-erez-israel\">Dr. Erna Meyer, \u003Cem>Wie kocht man in Erez Israel?\u003C/em>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Viola Alianov-Rautenberg\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/wie-kocht-man.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>How to cook in Palestine? This question was addressed in a plethora of publications in the Yishuv of the 1930s. One of the most active participants in this debate was Dr. Erna Meyer. Herself an immigrant from Nazi Germany, she had been a well-known expert on the domestic economy and the rationalization of housework prior to her immigration. Her cookbook \u003Cem>How to Cook in Palestine\u003C/em> was published in 1936 in Tel Aviv on behalf of the WIZO. It appeared in German, Hebrew, and English. The three languages notwithstanding, its main target group was the newly immigrated women from Nazi Germany. The cookbook provides insights into the norms that women were supposed to follow in the allegedly private realm of housework and nutrition in pre-state Israel.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the book, Meyer argues that the newcomers from Germany should overcome their Diaspora-identity through a new way of cooking, thereby becoming entrenched in their new homeland, Palestine. She prompts her readers to acquaint themselves with “healthy Palestine cooking.” This cuisine should be based on local food staples (e.g. eggplants and zucchini) instead of European cooking traditions. Meyer also makes it clear that the homemakers were no longer responsible solely for their own family but also for the Yishuv as a whole. In the struggle for supporting the developing national economy of the Yishuv, it was the responsibility of the homemaker to “vigorously strive to buy local products” (Tozeret Haaretz).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ben-shemen-as-an-emblem-of-a-jewish-heimat\">Ben Shemen as an emblem of a Jewish Heimat\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Ofer Ashkenazi\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/ben-shemen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The “youth village” Ben Shemen was designed to be a “home away from home” for Jewish teenagers who had recently immigrated to Mandate Palestine without their parents. The founders, Dr. Siegfried Lehmann, envisioned a new model of national education, which shapes individual and national identity through life and work in the rural landscape of the homeland.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At first glance, Zoltan Kluger’s photograph of Ben Shemen seems to be off the mark. Not only that the caption is wrong (the village was founded in 1927, not 1925), but the photograph also shows no sign of the features that distinguished the place from other educational institutions: e.g., the children who lived without a family in Palestine; their work in the fields; and the cultural programs that were integrated with the school curriculum. These aspects of the village were indeed underscored in various other photographs and films that documented it in the 1930s and 1940s. Yet Kluger’s image does capture the essence of Lehmann’s vision and understanding of the school. Located on the hill, surrounded by fields and a forest, the village is interwoven into the landscape while towering above it. Compared with the fields, the darker shade of the trees around the school simultaneously indicates the connection with the natural landscape and distinguishes the village from its surrounding. Simply put, in line with Lehmann’s intention, Kluger conceived Ben Shemen as an emblem of a Jewish Heimat: namely, the place that constitutes and displays the authentic bond between a people and its organic, national landscape.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"between-the-home-and-the-street-jewish-dress-and-the-crossing-of-boundaries\">Between the Home and the Street: Jewish Dress and the Crossing of Boundaries\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Cornelia Aust\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/franckfurther-jud-und-judin.jpg\" alt=\"Detail\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-07/friedrich-hottenroth4.png\" alt=\"Detail\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Items of Jewish dress are among the most interesting objects when looking at material culture, though early modern clothes are usually not preserved as objects themselves. Clothes were stored within the home when not used, though for many Jewish men and women there was not much to store. Most certainly had a separate set of clothes for Shabbat and the holidays. Clothes were worn inside and outside of the home, thus, being an object constantly crossing this boundary. Dress played a crucial role in the display of belonging, the positioning of the self within the community and vis-à-vis the other. Thus, dress closely connects Jewish homes with the life outside - within the Jewish quarter or street and on the general market place and city or village streets of early modern Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the sources commonly available to think about early modern Jewish dress are drawings and engravings (usually by non-Jewish artists) like the two displayed here. Presenting Jewish male and female dress from Nuremberg (or rather nearby Fürth as Nuremberg was closed to Jewish settlement) and Frankfurt am Main, both seem to provide a reliable depiction of early modern Jewish dress in the German lands. However, both only give a partial view. Like most drawings and engravings, they are depictions of ideal sets of dress, usually worn on Shabbat. Thus, they depict items such as the ruff or collar and the Shabbat cloak (\u003Cem>shulmantel\u003C/em>), which were not items of daily use. The Frankfurt couple included in the Neu-eröffnete Welt-Galleria of 1703 was a contemporary engraving (by Christoph Weigel), though we do not know who the model for the work was. By the late nineteenth century, Friedrich Hottenroth ventured into a three-volume project of depicting and describing German national costumes. He drew most of the depictions following older originals and descriptions. Interestingly, he mentions, that the woman’s large ruff was still common among Jews and non-Jews at the time. The red heart on the man’s costume, he states, was a specific local stigmatizing mark that Jews had to wear. However, we hardly know how he decided which clothes to depict and how to color them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ruines-de-capernaum-ruins-of-capernaum\">Ruines de Capernaum [Ruins of Capernaum]\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Melissa S.

Probing the palimpsests of the past, archaeologists excavating at Capernaum have subsequently revealed Roman/Byzantine remains including a richly decorated synagogue built from imported white limestone blocks (visible in the foreground of the image), as well as a modest Jewish fishing village with humble houses constructed from local basalt fieldstones (Tzaferis 1993).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Capernaum and other excavated settlements provide tangible windows into many aspects of “household Judaism” (Berlin 2005) and domestic life in ancient Palestine.

It was planned according to the principles of a ‘garden city’ by the German Jewish architect and town planner, Richard Kauffmann, who was back then the head of the planning department at the Jewish Agency. Hadar ha-Karmel was one of the first Jewish neighborhoods in Haifa, which was, and still is, a mixed city of Jews and Arabs. In the 1920s it was considered the distinct modern neighborhood of Haifa. After the 1929 Arab riots in Palestine, many Jews preferred to live in Hadar rather than in mixed neighborhoods of Jews and Arabs throughout the city. This led to the massive construction of modernist apartment buildings and the accelerated development of the neighborhood. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The photo shows the modern apartment buildings and a big public park in the heart of Hadar ha-Karmel.

Yet, less known are its descriptions of Jewish daily life in contemporary Venice. Indeed, in Venice despite ghettoization many Jews felt at home. His portrait on the frontispiece of \u003Cem>Historia de riti hebraici\u003C/em> shows Modena bare-headed. Leone Modena was willing to adopt the Italian social habit to remove one’s hat before Christians of honor instead of following the Jewish custom of covering of the head. Yet this portrait tells us something also about the Jewish home in the ghetto: Venetian Jews commissioned their own portraits quite often and more than elsewhere in both the contemporary Sephardi and the Ashkenazi worlds. In affluent Venetian Jewish homes, the \u003Cem>portego\u003C/em> (the typical hall) was often decorated with still life paintings (\u003Cem>nature morte\u003C/em>), decorative wall hangings (\u003Cem>arazzi\u003C/em>), gilded leathers (\u003Cem>cuori d’oro\u003C/em>), and portraits.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Jewish home in early modern Venice was as a space that opens onto an extensive social and cultural network of Jewish refugees of Sephardi origins, displaced after the medieval Jewish expulsions, along with Italian and Ashkenazi Jews as well as victims of slave-hunting corsair galleys that roamed throughout the Mediterranean. The latter could include Jews and Catholics, black sub-Saharan animists and Muslims, Christian Protestants and Orthodox, both men and women (mentions at 8-9, 37). Indeed, \u003Cem>Historia de riti hebraici\u003C/em> documents certain aspects of the reality of the ghetto in early-modern Venice and the cohabitation of Jewish families with Christian and Jewish servants and black slaves, who at the time were sold in the Barbary regencies (the centers of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli), the independent kingdom of Morocco, and the east (the “Levant”) from Cairo to Constantinople (110).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Once transported to Venice, the preeminent occupation for black African slaves would have been domestic service. Manumission was a recurrent stage or an event in their life course and in the ghetto it happened through circumcision for men and immersion into the \u003Cem>mikveh\u003C/em> (ritual bath) for both men and women (110). Black Africans never constituted more than a very small minority of the slave populations of the cities of Italy. Rationales for their subjugation on the basis of skin color did not take hold as they did in Spain and Portugal. Slaves and servants also functioned as a symbol of status. Many Venetian Jews probably shared the view of a Leone Modena’s responsum that contemporary slaves were more like employees than possessions: “Nowadays, when our servants are held by us as comrades and not as slaves, as they were wont to term them in the past, we will not put them to harsh work. (\u003Cem>Ziknei Yehudah\u003C/em>, Venice 1650, no. 34).” Ultimately, Leone Modena’s \u003Cem>Historia de riti hebraici\u003C/em> as well as his and other contemporary Venetian rabbis’ responsa capture the complexity and alterity of the Jewish household and the broader Jewish society that in Venice were less prone to exclusivity, purification, and purgation than other early-modern religious and ethnic communities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-jewish-home-in-fatamid-egypt\">The Jewish Home in Fatamid Egypt\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Miriam Frenkel\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/ashmolean.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The Jewish house in the lands of Islam during the high middle ages (10 th -13 th centuries) was void of any heavy wooden furniture of the kind known in Christian Europe.

This was part of the \u003Cem>bon ton\u003C/em> in furnishing Jewish, as well as the Muslim and Christian homes. Spaciousness was the desirable look of a home and it was achieved by this roominess.

The image appears in Levak’s book, \u003Cem>Our Country\u003C/em>, published four years later, and is reproduced here with his permission. When viewed from a wide perspective, paying attention to the context in which a woman is dragging a heavy couch, this image is rich with Jewish-Israeli collective symbols of home and belonging. The location is at one of Jerusalem’s most iconic intersections, where the modern neighborhood of Rehavia in West Jerusalem meets the historical past of Jerusalem’s Old walled city, and where the Great Synagogue of Jerusalem stands just a few meters away. The image invites the viewer to reflect on the profound meaning attached to this place. The Kings Hotel was among the first to be built in Jerusalem after the establishment of Israel in 1948; the Great Synagogue was dedicated to the memory of the six millions Jews who perished in the Holocaust and to the fallen soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces; Rehavia is a neighborhood associated with German-Jewish culture, and with upper-class Ashkenazi Jews.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yet, when we return our attention to the woman right at the middle of the image, the concepts of home and belonging shift from their collective and solid, even glorified and poetic, meanings, into much more fluid, flexible and negotiable ones. Crossing King George Street with this very heavy couch, this woman seems to be in the middle of a heroic effort to arrive, to find—to arrive and to find—a place, a place to settle down; a place where she can put the heavy couch she has just found, a couch on which to sit, to rest, to feel a degree of safety and comfort. As a sort of counter-narrative to all the collective symbols surrounding her, this woman, with this heavy couch, provides an individual, improvised, practical and casual meaning to these wonderful concepts: home and belonging.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"jewish-sabbath-candles-for-latin-readers-willem-surenhusiuss-edition-of-the-mishnah\">Jewish Sabbath Candles for Latin readers: Willem Surenhusius’s edition of the Mishnah\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Gregg E.

It is often the objects inside the home and how they are used that help create and define a distinctly Jewish space. One of the most well-known household objects associated with characteristically Jewish rituals is a set of candlesticks for fulfilling the obligation to kindle two lights on Friday evening to mark the onset of the Sabbath. The origins of the custom are unclear; later rabbinic interpreters would attribute it to two biblical passages—one candle to mark the instruction in Exodus 20:8 to “remember” the Sabbath, the other to mark Deuteronomy 5:12’s precept to “observe” the Sabbath. There is little evidence, however, that this was understood as a religious obligation before the Hellenistic or early Roman age. By the first century CE, we have writings from Roman onlookers testifying that Jews light oil lamps—which were used before candles—to mark the onset of the Sabbath. As they did with many rituals that had been only vaguely or sporadically followed beforehand, the early rabbis would take up lighting, elevate it to religious obligation, and discuss it in detail. Most notably, we see this in the Mishnah, the earliest work of rabbinic law (dating to the third century CE), particularly tractate Shabbat, chapter 2. The level of interest in even the most minute detail of these laws is exemplified by the rabbis’ discussions of the permissible kinds of oils and materials for wicks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The figure at left shows a Hebrew-Latin edition of the Mishnah, translated by Willem Surenhusius (c.1664 –1729) a Dutch Christian scholar of Hebrew, and printed between 1698 and 1703. It includes commentary by traditional rabbinic thinkers (Maimonides, Bertinoro), as well as early modern Christian scholars. Translating the Mishnah into Latin made its teachings—and rabbinic thought—accessible to a broader audience of thinkers, historians, and theologians. Indeed, the earliest rabbis’ thoughts and ideas on lighting Sabbath lamps, as well as an array of laws on other areas of socio-religious thought, would reach a far broader audience and have far more influence within Judaism than the third-century rabbis could have anticipated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"spindle-whorls-the-jewish-home-as-worksite\">Spindle whorls: the Jewish home as worksite\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Pratima Gopalakrishnan\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/spindle-whorl.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>This item is one of 55 at the Penn Museum that is marked as “spindle whorl” and dated to the period of Roman rule in Judea. All 55 items are from Penn’s archaeological expedition in Beth Shean during the 1920s. Spindle whorls are disc- shaped objects with a hole in them, and they are attached to the spindle rod to provide weight and momentum as fiber was spun into yarn. Spindle rods were made of wood, and therefore disintegrate, but since spindle whorls were made of materials like ivory, glass, and bone, they survive in the archaeological record.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These items reflect the ubiquity of spinning in the ancient household. The ancient home was not a refuge from work, but rather a site of work. This is especially true of textile work. A great variety of textile products, destined for a variety of uses, were produced and traded throughout the Roman Empire. Spinning represented a major bottleneck within the process of textile production since it was extremely labor- intensive work. Spinning was ever-present work, the work free and enslaved women in the household could not escape. The \u003Cem>bayit\u003C/em> was not the site of decommodified work hermetically sealed from the market, but rather the social unit that regulated free and enslaved women’s work for that market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"homeless-in-their-homeland-mizrahis-gender-and-law-in-israel\">Homeless in Their Home/Land: Mizrahis, Gender and Law in Israel\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Claris Harbon\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/homeless.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>As if happening these days in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1959, in Wadi Salib a former Palestinian neighborhood in Haifa, a community of Moroccan Jews led by David Ben Harosh rebelled against their systemic oppression and racism inflicted by Ashkenazi establishment. They were crushed by the police, the courts and the public. In this picture, here a young man holds the flag of Israel. What you cannot see here are two important things: first, the flag is stained with blood, and second it had a profound sentence written on it: “Hassan King of Morocco, Take Us Back”. Let us briefly reflect on this short and yet deep sentence. These people, all Moroccan Jews, were probably all traditional/Masortim, for whom Israel was their home and refuge from the Diaspora. They are now asking the Muslim King, from whom they were taken away, usually indoctrinated to believe that he was their enemy, to take them back. They want to go back to the Diaspora. לחזור לגלות. This begs many questions, but one common thread: a sense of alienation and diasporic identity has been created persisting nowadays, at that exact home, where diaspora was meant to end. Corresponding with the subject and themes of my research, this is translated into a sense of temporality, destruction. Of defeatism. Of people who do not feel any affiliation to their homes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In my work I offer a new understanding of the role of ‘home,’ particularly public housing in Israel, as a site of both oppression, dispossessing Mizrahis of their homes and homeland, culminating in instilling feelings of homelessness, and of resistance and agency, even reconciliation, generating defiant memories and social justice, redefining Israeli property laws.

Situated in the historic region of Podolia, one of the major destination areas of Semion An-sky’s expeditions in the early 20th c., Bershad was a town where St. Petersburg Judaica Center, of which I was then part, conducted ethnographic research in the post-Holocaust Jewish survivor communities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On that day as I was walking along one of the town streets, and one uninhabited run-down Jewish house, one of many of such kind, somehow drew my attention. I jumped over the low fence and crawled into the house through what once was the door.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My intuition did not deceive me: this house contained probably one of the last extant \u003Cstrong>removable ceilings\u003C/strong> – a distinct feature of local Jewish architecture. In this area shtetl houses were built so close to each other that there was no space for an outside sukkah. So, Jews were using their verandas for that purpose, with ceilings removed for the holiday.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The ceiling I discovered was composed of 6 squares (one already missing), attached above an outside verandah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Needless to say, this particular architectural contraption proved to be extremely useful under the late Soviet regime: one could celebrate Sukkoth (\u003Cem>Sikes\u003C/em> in Ukrainian Yiddish) not being observed by the watchful eye of the local Soviet authorities – or nosy neighbors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Therefore – since the house itself was most probably built in the early 20 th c. – one can safely say that this removable ceiling presents a concise symbol of the Jewish life that went on even in the most adverse circumstances, of the grass-root resistance to the anti-religious ethos of the state and its anti-Semitic policies, as well as of the creativity mobilized by Soviet Jews for this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"cheap-houses-building-affordable-hygienic-housing-in-warsaw-and-vilna\">Cheap Houses: Building affordable, hygienic housing in Warsaw and Vilna\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Cecile E.

As the development of urban infrastructure lagged reformers grew increasingly alarmed by a lack of affordable, hygienic housing. One of the most ambitious and successful projects to address this concern was the initiative of the Jewish banker and philanthropist Hipolit Wawelberg (1843-1901). In 1897 Wawelberg decided to “provid[e] working people with cheap, hygienic, and civilized housing” in the outlying Wola neighborhood of Warsaw. He erected three large blocks with modern apartments as well as auxiliary buildings housing amenities including baths, a day care, a clinic, and a room for “decent entertainment.” Wawelberg hoped this complex would “foster mutual respect and tolerance” between Jewish and Christian Poles and mandated that residents be drawn equally from both groups.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These so-called “cheap houses” inspired a similar project in Vilna the following year and a second nearby development in Warsaw in 1925. Yet their success was tempered by high construction and maintenance costs, which led to less profitability and more crowded conditions than anticipated. Moreover, few Jews chose to inhabit the apartments, thwarting Wawelberg’s goal of promoting Jewish-Christian co-existence. These buildings created comfortable and sanitary homes for poor Warsaw residents and a new kind of community that encompassed public health, social welfare, and cultural functions. Yet Jews’ failure to feel at home there suggests the difficulty of creating true integration on the intimate level of domestic space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"yoma-footprints-of-a-jewish-book\">Yoma: Footprints of a Jewish Book\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Marjorie Lehman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-home/yoma-footprints-jewish-book?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/callnumber.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-home/yoma-footprints-jewish-book?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/binding.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-home/yoma-footprints-jewish-book?item=2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-05/detail.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Between 1519 and 1523 the first complete editions of the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds were printed in Italy. An entrepreneur from Antwerp, Daniel Bomberg (b. 1483) had made a significant business decision, opening a printing house in Venice. Printed copies of the Talmuds sold well. The printing house also became a meeting place for Jews and non-Jews to share printing skills, business acumen and ideas. The strong desire on the part of Jews—some to study and some to own a material copy of the Talmud—generated the need for second, third and fourth printings. Many of the copies, which were often purchased volume-by-volume, outlived their owners, passing hands many times. They continually entered new homes, becoming increasingly valuable over time. The Library of the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies has become the home to many of these Bomberg volumes, each copy with its own story, each possessing information attesting not only to the movement of Jewish books across the globe, but to individuals who owned, read, bought, sold and gifted them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Many of the Bomberg Talmud copies owned today by the Katz Center once belonged to the great book collector and native of Philadelphia, Mayer Sulzberger (b. 1843). After his death in 1923 they found a new home in the library of Dropsie College. Due to financial strains, Dropsie became the Annenberg Research Institute in 1986 and then merged with Penn in 1993, becoming the Center for Judaic Studies. It was renamed the Center for Advanced Judaica Studies in 1998, and now is the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The copy of \u003Cem>Masekhet Yoma\u003C/em> displayed here took a different path from Sulzberger’s collection. It came from the personal library of Samuel Tobias Lachs who was a professor of Religion at Bryn Mawr College for most of his career. He received his AB from the University of Pennsylvania in 1946 and his PhD from Dropsie College in 1958. Upon his death in 2000, his wife, G. Phyllis Lachs, presumably because of her husband’s connection to Penn and Dropsie, donated some of her husband’s most valuable books to the Katz Center. Included was this copy of \u003Cem>Yoma\u003C/em>, several other volumes of the Bomberg Talmud as well as Lachs’ unfinished scholarly works.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In its new home, Lachs’ copy of \u003Cem>Yoma\u003C/em> connects us to his life, his love of Jewish books, and to his devotion to scholarship in the field of rabbinics. It is also a testament to the fact that Jewish Studies has found a home at major research universities, building scholarly communities around the availability of valuable resources. The care that has been taken to preserve this copy of \u003Cem>Maskekhet Yoma\u003C/em>, including the clues to its past homes, is evident in a note found inside its pages with the name of Abraham Moses Luncz. It is not clear whether Lachs and Luncz had a familial relationship, nor can we be sure that this copy of \u003Cem>Yoma\u003C/em> was in Luncz’s possession. However, this piece of paper brings us to the home of Luncz, another book lover who lived in Jerusalem from 1868 until his death in 1918. He ran a printing press during his lifetime. An article written about him in the Jewish Encyclopedia reports that in 1904 he was involved in printing an edition of the Jerusalem Talmud, a sure reflection of his interest in Jewish books and a sign that he might have owned this volume of \u003Cem>Yoma\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This copy of \u003Cem>Yoma\u003C/em> is only one example of the many books at the Katz center, each with a history waiting to be told.

The reason is not surprising. It bears a striking resemblance to a ketubah hanging in our living room – a ketubah presented to me years ago by my late father when he learned that I was writing a thesis on the history of the ketubah and its illustration. This was no ordinary ketubah he gave me. It belonged to his parents, my grandparents, who both passed away when I was a child, a few years after the entire Jewish community of Zakho in Iraqi Kurdistan (northern Iraq) immigrated to the young State of Israel. The ketubah of my grandparents, inscribed and witnessed in Zakho in 1912, was obviously created by the same anonymous scribe and folk artist responsible for the present attractive document (Zucker Ketubah 6).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>According to oral traditions, the Jews of Kurdistan claim they are descendants of the Ten Tribes who first arrived in this area after the Assyrian conquest of the Northern Kingdom of Israel (722 BCE). In fact, in this and every other Zakho ketubah, the city is described as situated on the bank of the river Khabour (כאן במתא זאכו דעל נהר כאבור יתבא), a tributary of the Euphrates. Zakho Jews believed this is the same river called חבור (Ḥabor) mentioned in the Bible (2 Kings 17:6), and identify their hometown with one of the sites to which the Israelites were exiled with the fall of the Northern Kingdom in the time of King Hoshea. Moreover, the Jews of Zakho, as many other Jewish communities of Kurdistan, speak a dialect of the ancient Aramaic language (often called Neo-Aramaic). The word for the bridal canopy (\u003Cem>ḥupah\u003C/em>) in our dialect is גנוניה (\u003Cem>genunei\u003C/em>) the _s_ame Aramaic term used in the Talmud (e.g., Nedarim 50b). The biblical word \u003Cem>ḥupah\u003C/em> (e.g., Joel 2:16) certainly implies a room where the bridal couple were united for the first time. While in other Jewish communities the \u003Cem>ḥupah\u003C/em> became a symbolic canopy raised over the bridal couple, Kurdish Jews preserved the ancient custom and made it as a room – a beautifully decorated bridal chamber with colorful woven fabrics, where the newlywed spent the seven days of the wedding festivities together (with a child seated between them) and guests came to visit them. This room thus served not only as a symbol of the wedding and fertility, but the actual “first home” of the groom and bride.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The contents of the dowry (some of it bought by the \u003Cem>mohar\u003C/em> or bride’s price raised by the groom’s family) brought to the couple’s new home is detailed at length in the ketubah. The list appears in the middle of the page written in a different colored, light ink. Each item is mentioned by its name in the local dialects (written in Hebrew letters). The monetary value of each item is written below it in Arabic numerals. The practice was for all the dowry items to be presented publicly on the wedding day for appraisal by experts. The \u003Cem>Ḥakham\u003C/em> would then inscribe the stated values, one by one, in front of all those present, onto the space on the page left for this purpose by the community’s expert scribe, who had drawn up the ketubah in advance. Finally, the community’s and the bridal couple’s expectations of what ideally should “fill” their new home is expressed in the wish that God will grant them “honest and respectable offspring, who observe the Torah and the commandments.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"inspiring-jewish-collectivism\">Inspiring Jewish Collectivism\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Katherine Sorrels\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/sorrels.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>This text by the Welsh thinker and industrialist Robert Owen (1771-1859) is a radical proposal for socialist reform.

This text is an 1821 a proposal for a cooperative based on these principles in Scotland. The most famous of his initiatives was New Harmony, a community established in Indiana in 1825.

The first community, called Camphill Special School, grew into an international movement of over 130 Camphill and Camphill-inspired communities around the world. The mission to provide a shared sense of home for abled and disabled community members has sustained the movement for eighty years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"maaseh-tuviah-jews-bodies-health-and-houses\">Ma’aseh Tuviah: Jews, Bodies, Health, and Houses\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Joshua Teplitsky\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-07/tep.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Plague in early modern Europe was a disease of the house (Snowden, 42). Its transmission by fleas meant that domestic living conditions were a crucial factor in the spread of illness. An array of sources from the period reflect this understanding, even if the microbiological underpinnings of disease transmission were not established until the late nineteenth century: state archives preserve documents ordering the cleaning of houses, the separation of individuals, and concern over objects within the home; religious texts debated the merits of flight versus home isolation; and medical textbooks offered wisdom about treatment and prevention through home remedies.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A touchstone of scholarly exploration of Jewish medical knowledge in the early modern period, the book \u003Cem>Ma’aseh Tuviyah\u003C/em> is an apt artefact for thinking about Jews, bodies, health, and houses. First published in 1707, the book’s metaphorical rendition of a human body as a house offers a visual representation of the theme of this seminar year (Lepicard, 229-255). The second volume of the work, first published in Jessnitz in 1720, bore a sub-section entitled “Mishmeret ha-Bayit” [The Watch of the House]—meant to invoke both the body as house and the importance of the home itself—which deals largely with forms of illness.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This text offers a powerful, yet common, example of the importance of house and home in the history of disease in Jewish life. The author deals with types of illnesses—including plague “that most fearful of all illnesses”—and considers the medical commonality between Jews and non-Jews both in their experiences and by drawing together Jewish and non-Jewish sources. The work thus represents a valuable window into thinking about body and house as the locus for prevention, treatment, and cure, as well as our understandings of Jews as they related to their neighbors in early modern Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"freuds-uncanny-home-office\">Freud’s Uncanny Home Office\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Liliane Weissberg\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220806084125im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/freud.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>In 1919, Sigmund Freud published an essay that focuses on the term \u003Cem>heimlich\u003C/em>, that designates what belongs to a home, and on its counterpart, \u003Cem>unheimlich\u003C/em> or “uncanny.” They turn into central notions of psychoanalysis.

It turns into the central locus of psychoanalysis and its practice.

During the past year (2005-06), the Fellows at CAJS explored the Jewish book as an historical agent in Jewish culture and as a medium of exchange within the larger cultures in which Jews have lived. Their work drew upon a variety of inter-disciplinary perspectives with the aim of uniting scholars working in the traditional fields of Jewish studies with scholars of the history of the book.\n\nAmong the questions these scholars grappled with were: How have the materiality and formatting of texts from antiquity to the present shaped authorship, reception, interpretation, and transmission? How have the business of Jewish book production and the market forces of book consumption affected Jewish life and culture? How have the visual art and design of Jewish books shaped reading habits, legibility, recollection, and signification? How have cultures of Jewish reading changed over time, creating new forms of social experience while testing communal authority as well as gender boundaries? What has been the fate of Jewish books, libraries, book producers, publishers, and readers, under conditions of censorship and persecution? We hope you enjoy this exhibition which offers you some choice selections of the first fruits of their ground-breaking research.\n\n#### Arthur Kiron\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### The Advent of the Jewish Book\n\nMalachi Beit-Arie\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Beit-Arie.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/advent-jewish-book?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Beit-Arie2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/advent-jewish-book?item=1)\n\nThe extraordinary historical circumstances, which scattered the Jewish communities around the Mediterranean basin and further eastward, northward, and westward, brought them into contact with diversified civilizations, religions, and societies. As a result, Hebrew manuscripts are cross-cultural agents and significant artifacts for studying the history of the handwritten book in all the other civilizations around the Mediterranean, predominantly those of Islam and Christianity. Due to the far flung territorial dispersion of the Jews, and their adherence to their national script, medieval manuscripts written in Hebrew characters were produced in a territorial range larger than that of their Greek, Latin, or even Arabic counterparts, as Hebrew handwritten books were manufactured and disseminated within and across all these main and other, more minor, booklore zones. In contrast to Christian society, where literacy was concentrated among clerics and aristocrats, Jewish society was largely classless, and literacy was widespread. Extensive book consumption and a remarkably high rate of user-produced books, which was initiated not by intellectual or academic establishments but privately, inevitably resulted in a relatively high rate of book production.\n\nThe number of surviving medieval books of the Jewish minority is naturally much smaller than that of extant Latin or Arabic ones. However, the extant Hebrew manuscripts probably represent only a small proportion of the total Jewish book production, very likely much smaller than the proportion of Latin manuscripts relative to total Latin book production. The loss of most of the codices was not the consequence of historical conditions alone. Hebrew books were destroyed or abandoned not only through wanderings, emigrations, persecutions, and expulsions, or confiscated and burned in Christian countries; they were above all worn out by use. Unlike Latin, Greek and, to a certain degree, Arabic books, they were not preserved either in well-protected royal or aristocratic collections or in monasteries, mosques, or religious or academic institutions, but were privately owned and used.\n\nMoreover, the roughly 100,000 extant medieval Hebrew codices and their fragments represent the book production output of only the last six centuries of the Middle Ages. The revolutionary codex form of the book, which was adopted and diffused by Christians already in the first centuries of our era and replaced the old roll form in the areas around the Mediterranean from about 300, was employed by the Jews much later, as is attested both by findings and by textual evidence. Between the abundant finds of Hebrew books from Late Antiquity b rt of the Hellenistic and early Roman period b some eight hundred years almost without evidence of the Hebrew book, in either roll or codex form. The earliest extant categorically dated Hebrew codices were written at the beginning of the tenth century, all of them in the Middle East. However, in the structural, figural, and artistic design of the copied texts, in their harmonious scripts and shared styles, and in the mature employment of codicological practices, these earliest manuscripts demonstrate elaborate craftsmanship and regularity, surely attesting to a long-established tradition of codex design and production.\n\nFrom the eleventh century on, dated manuscripts have survived also from Italy and the Maghreb, while those produced in the Iberian Peninsula, France, Germany, England, and Byzantium date from the twelfth century on. Until the middle of the thirteenth century their number, mainly produced outside the Middle East, is rather small; but it increases thereafter, reaching a peak in the fifteenth century. Thus the history of the medieval Hebrew book and of Hebrew palaeography and codicology is largely confined to the high and late Middle Ages. The dated manuscripts furnish us with solid knowledge of the crystallized types of Hebrew book scripts, scribal practices, and codicological techniques in the high and late Middle Ages in the Islamic East, where the Arabic script was employed, in the Christian West, where the Latin script was used, and in the Byzantine zone, where the Greek script was used. They enable us to unfold the rich variety of their traditions and styles evolving over space and time and to draw a firm typology of the hand-produced Hebrew book.\n\nAll the earliest extant hand-written Hebrew codices of the tenth and the early-eleventh- century are biblical. They bear witness to the large-scale project of producing and disseminating the massoretic version of the vocalized and accentuated Bible as was forged in Tiberias in Palestine by generations of experts of the transmission of the authentic text of the biblical books. The adoption of the codex form by the Jews coincided with the crystallization of the Massoretic version of the Hebrew Bible. Scribes and vocalizers in the Orient were engaged in fixing the biblical texts in codex form and disseminating them on a large scale. The remarkable scope of this production and diffusion has become known to us only recently, following the dramatic accessibility of the rich collections of the Russian National Library (formerly the Saltykov-Shchedrin State Public Library) in St. Petersburg, where some two thousand surviving biblical codices, or their fragments, are kept, many of which have been found to date from the tenth and eleventh centuries. The text of these codices, as in those which followed them in all the other regions of the East and West, was accompanied by the Massora, lexical and grammatical annotations pertaining to spelling, vocalization, and accentuation, intended to safeguard the accurate transmission of the biblical text. These complex notations were written in detail in a minute script on the upper and lower margins, while much shorter and abbreviated notations were written between the columns and on the inner and outer margins. At the beginning, the Massoretic annotations were probably written by the scholarly massoretes themselves, as in the case of the famous Aleppo Codex, which was vocalized, accentuated and massoreted in Palestine around 930 by the most important massorete, Aharon ben Asher, himself. Soon after, the complicated task of matching the copying of the annotations to the relevant text while disposing them in aesthetic patterns was left to scribes or vocalizers, who as early as the tenth century exploited the secondary text as a decorative device. Later, scribes or vocalizers enhanced this visual manipulation of the Massora still further, sketching not only sophisticated abstract geometrical and floral interlaced ornamentation, as can be seen in plate 18, but also elaborate zoomorphic and anthropomorphic images, even illustrations to the biblical text The secondary text lost its verbal meaning altogether, and was transformed into a sheer visually expressive tool.\n\nThe earliest surviving dated manuscript of the whole Bible, which was selected for this exhibition as a remarkable representative of the early Hebrew book production, is kept in the National Library of Russia in St. Petersburg, MS EBP. IIB 19a, produced in Cairo in 1008 by the prestigious scribe Shemuel ben Ya'aqov. The images display the artistic and scribal craft facet of those bibles produced in the Middle East at the outset of the Jewish codex. Fol. 73v displays a decorated carpet-page of Massoretic text, while fol. 478r shows one of the ornamented parts of the multi-pages colophon of the scribe.\n\n### Jewish Letters Before the Codex\n\nMarc Bregman\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Bregman.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/jewish-letters-codex?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4486_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/jewish-letters-codex?item=1)\n\nFragments of non-biblical texts, mostly recovered from the Cairo Genizah that were committed to writing in horizontal scrolls similar to Torah scrolls seem to represent early versions of the texts they preserve, including Talmud, Midrash and other post-biblical genres of Hebrew writing. Only very few of these fragments have been published or discussed in the scholarly literature. One of these is a fragment of a very early version of Avot de-Rabbi Natan that seems to have been copied before the Islamic conquests of the Near East and may represent the earliest fragment of rabbinic literature that has so far come to light.\n\nThe second manuscript displayed here is a palimpsest. The lower Greek text seems to preserve a sixth century transcription of the New Testament Book of Acts.. The upper Hebrew text preserves an early midrash on Genesis 40:18-41:3, 46:28-47:1 copied in the 10th century or earlier. This text is similar to, but not identical with, Midrash Genesis Rabbah on the same biblical passages, and therefore represents an early and important addition to our knowledge of rabbinic biblical interpretation.\n\n### A Bible from the Genizah\n\nDavid Stern\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Stern.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/bible-genizah?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Stern2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/bible-genizah?item=1)\n\nThese two images are the recto and verso of a single folio surviving from an early Bible codex written in the Near East in the 10th century. The folio was found in the famous Cairo Genizah in the Ben-Ezra synagogue in Fustat (Old Cairo) and came to Penn as part of the Dropsie College Genizah collection acquired at the beginning of the last century.\n\nThe codex from which this folio derived is a typical example of a Masoretic Bible, known after its producers, the Masoretes or ba’alei ha-mesorah, who were also the authors of the scribal annotations known as the Masorah and whose Biblical text has become, in one of its several versions, the canonical text of the Bible. The Masoretic codices are also the earliest surviving Jewish codices, and effectively mark the transition in Jewish culture from the scroll to the book-form we use today.\n\nThe typical page of the Masoretic codex, fully represented in this folio, inscribes that moment of transition between the two mediums of book-technology. The Biblical text is arranged in three columns that imitate the traditional form of a Torah scroll, albeit on a page, and as in a Torah-scroll, the text is written in the formal square, so-called Assyrian letters. In the codex, however, the text also contains vowelization points beneath the letters as well as the te’amim, the accentuation marks both beneath and above them. In addition, the codex contains the Masoretic notes in its two traditional forms— on the one hand, the masorah ketanah (masorah parva) in the abbreviations recorded in the space between the columns; and on the other, the masorah gedolah (masorah magna), in the two lines at the top of the page and the two lines at the bottom. Both types of notes, written in micrography or miniscule writing, record and enumerate all the peculiarities and singular features of the Biblical text, presumably in order to safeguard its accurate transmission though they may also have served an early exegetical function.\n\nThe page format of these early codices provides the basic model for numerous Bible manuscripts produced throughout the Middle Ages as well as the text and the annotations preserved in the printed Bibles known as the Miqraot Gedolot or Rabbinic Bible. To this day, the Masoretic Bible remains the basic text that defines what we call the Jewish Bible.\n\n### The Lobed Mazzot of the Birds' Head Haggadah\n\nNaomi Feuchtwanger-Sarig\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Sarig.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe oldest surviving illuminated Passover _Haggadah_ from _Ashkenaz_ is the well-known “Birds’ Head Haggadah” from the Upper Rhine region of Germany. Copied and decorated around 1300, it presents a close-to-complete text of the _Seder_ ritual as it is celebrated today. The _Haggadah_ contains mainly marginal illustrations, which not only illuminate the text, but also serve as didactic visual portrayals of the ceremony and the customs connected to it.\n\nThe anonymous artist of the _Haggadah_ clearly distinguished between two types of _mazzot_: the three “precept _mazzot_” and those that do not serve any ritual function. He was clearly familiar with the order in which the _mazzot_ are to be used. Appropriately, he marked them with the respective number of lobes protruding from their circumference, in perfect correlation to the _minhag_.\n\nPortraying part of the ritual preceding the meal, the artist appended two marginal images to this page. The man at the top seems to be preparing, stirring or forking the bitter herbs for the _maror,_ to be eaten while reciting the appropriate benediction. In the lower margin, the illustration depicts the ensuing ritual in the progression of the _Seder_. Following the eating of the _maror_, one is instructed to take a combination of condiments, in fulfillment of _Korekh_. In keeping with the tradition laid down by Hillel in the first century of the Common Era, some greens (“_Leituga”_, or lettuce) and a bit of the third _mazzah_ are eaten together. The bird-headed man is shown raising both foodstuffs, about to join them and eat them together for the _Korekh_.\n\nThe unique form of the _mazzah_ reflects the custom – rarely adhered to – of marking the three “precept _mazzot_” which are obligatory for the fulfillment of the rituals of the _Seder_. Accordingly, when depicting the moment in which the first _mazzah_ is taken, the cake shown by the artist has one protuberance, while the second and third \\_mazzot\\_are marked respectively with two or three lobes.\n\nFirst referred to in writing as “marks” or “signs” in the twelfth century, the lobed _mazzot_ are visually manifested for the first time in the “Bird’s Head Haggadah”.\n\n### A Hebrew Florentine Manuscript Commissioned by the Medici Family\n\nNurit Pasternak\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Pasternak.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nMS Jerusalem, Israel Museum 180/55 contains the liturgical biblical corpus of Psalms, Job and Proverbs, named _Sifrei Emet._ This tiny volume (measuring 95X65 mm) made of the finest parchment was produced in mid fifteenth-century Florence by one of the most prestigious, skilled and prolific Italian Hebrew scribes known to us. Although the manuscript bears no colophon, both the elegant Italian semi-cursive writing and the manuscript's codicological and palaeographical features disclose the hand and the craft of Yitzhaq ben Ovadia ben David of Forli, who had been active in Florence for some three decades, ever since 1441. Isaac seems to have been a paragon of the Florentine _bel-libro_ among Jewish scribes of his day: his manuscripts no doubt reflect a kinship to the beautiful but sober volumes, characterized by the highest level of both materials and execution, of humanistic Florence. Furthermore, a close study of his work seems to attest that in many aspects he led the way for Hebrew scribes in the adoption and integration of the local book-craft practices of their Christian environment, some of which had gradually become, in the course of the _Quattrocento_, the current practices of Hebrew manuscript production in Italy.\n\nA salient feature of Isaac's manuscripts is their rich decoration: some, such as the Israel Museum's _Sifrei Emet_ codex, include full-page miniatures, decorated panels, broad illuminated borders with floral and foliate ornaments, medallions, putti, birds of all sorts, peacocks, bees, lions and deers; and, in the finest manuscripts – human figures. All manuscripts belonging to this category of elaborate decoration contain gold, some bear family coats-of-arms or emblems. No doubt the typical Florentine style of the illuminated borders and miniatures indicates they had been executed by local Christian artists and workshops.\n\nMS Israel Museum, in addition to three full-page miniatures (featuring David triumphant over Goliath, Job, and King Solomon in Judgment), encloses a richly ornamented frontispiece which holds a unique attestation to Medici ownership: at the bottom of the frame, the family device consisting of a diamond ring with three feathers, white pink and green (possibly representing the young Lorenzo the Magnificent who had just come into power) and beneath – the motto _semper_.\n\n### The Jewish Humanist Library in Italy\n\nFederica Francesconi\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Francesconi.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/jewish-humanist-library-italy?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Francesconi2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/jewish-humanist-library-italy?item=1)\n\nThe banker Moisè Modena (1539-1630) owned a library, which in 1599 consisted of 100 titles of Latin and Italian books and 145 titles of Hebrew books. He was neither a rabbi nor a famous scholar or physician, but a wealthy and –probably– a cultured man. The two sons, the famous kabbalist Aharon Berechiah (1576-1639) and Salomone (1583-?) respectively of 24 and 17 years old, the former was already rabbi and the second not yet. In his library we can see perhaps some lines of the classical background of an acculturated Jew who lived at the turn of the 16th century to 17th century: from the commentaries of Rashi to \\_Sefer Ha-Kuzari\\_and _Me'or ʻenayim_, from Francesco Petrarca to Marsilio Ficino. What seems particularly interesting about the library of Moisè Modena is the possibility to distinguish a certain concrete connection between Jewish culture, the Medieval and Renaissance basic texts, and the general Italian culture of his time. In the library of Moisè Modena we can find in fact the classical works _Masoret ha-masoret_ of ’Elie ha-Levi Ashkenazi, _Diqduqe_ of Rashi, _Sefer ha-shorashim_ of David Qimhi (Venice, 1542) and the rethoric treatise _Nofet Sufim_ of Judah Messer Leone. Furthermore, we can see Jewish classic medieval works like _Sefer ha-Kuzari_ of Judah ha-Levi, an the the late medieval book like _Or ‘ammin_ of Obadia Sforno (Bologna, 1537), the _Or ha-Shem_ of Hasday Crescas and a group of more Humanistic oriented books such as _Minkhat kenaot_ of Yehiel Nissim da Pisa and the _Me'or ʻenayim_ of Azaria de Rossi.\n\nMoisè Modena' library shows two different cultural trends in the libraries of the Modenese Jewish intelligentsia: books on Italian rhetoric and the so-called line of “humaniores litterae”. In fact he owned _Il presente libro insegna la vera arte delo excellente scrivere_ of Giovanni Antonio Tagliente (Venice, 1524), the _Applicamento de i precetti della inuentione, dispositione, et elocutione, che propriamente serue allo scrittore di epistole latine, et volgari_ of Oratio Toscanella, and specifically regarding the rethoric and the so-called line of “humaniores litterae” he had bought: Prose of Pietro Bembo (_nelle quali si ragiona della volgar lingua scritte al cardinale de Medici,_ Venice, 1525), _Tabulae totius dialectices aliarum artiuminstrumenti praecepta vtilissima breuiter complectentes, ordine perspicuo digestae a Cornelio Valerio_ (Venice, 1564), the _Dialectica Ioannis_ Antonii Delphini (Venice, 1555), _Quattro lettere di monsig. Gasparo Contarino Cardinale_ (Florence, 1558), Petrarca’s _Trionfi_ with the commentary of Vellutello (Venice, 1550), and the _Tomo primo delle divine lettere di Marsilio Ficino, tradotte in toscano per M. Felice Figliucci_ (Venice, 1546-1548).\n\n### The Examination of the World\n\nAdam Shear\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Shear.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/examination-world?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Shear2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/examination-world?item=1)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Shear3.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/examination-world?item=2)\n\nIn sixteenth-century Italy, philosophical and kabbalistic learning was generally conceived by Jewish intellectuals in terms of how to attain perfection as a human being. This was, in essence, the same kind of endeavor as the goal of self-improvement promulgated in ethical or moralizing literature. Philosophy and _musar_ existed on an imagined spectrum of erudition. In fact, however, many of the authors were the same, and their works could be marketed on different levels to different audiences. It is important to understand that printers, editors, publishers, commentators aimed at a “popular” audience in the sense that they wanted the readership of printed books to be as wide as possible.\n\nBedersi’s _Beḥinat Olam_ \\[Examination of the World\\], a philosophical meditation on the wonders and the vanities of the world, was written in Spain the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century, and became one of the most popular works of medieval Jewish thought in the early modern period and was reprinted often from the fifteenth through the eighteenth centuries. Here, we see the opening pages of two mid-sixteenth century editions from northern Italy. In 1551/52, one of the first products of the ibn Askara press in Ferrara was a quarto edition of the work, with the text of _Beḥinat Olam_ printed with _nikud_ (vowel points). Along with the text, we also find new introductions and commentaries by Moses ibn Habib and Joseph Frances. This edition was presumably aimed at a scholarly audience looking for quarto editions and good commentaries. At the same time, the presence of _nikud_ in the text alongside the learned commentaries suggests an availability of the work to a less learned audience. Four years later, the press of Jacob ben Naftali ha-Kohen in Mantua issued an edition with a vocalized text as well as a reprint of the short, anonymous commentary included in the 1484 Soncino edition. This edition, in octavo and with a shorter commentary, appears to have been intended as a popular work._Beḥinat Olam_ could be presented to audiences as a poetic appreciation of God’s world or as the vehicle for discussion of serious philosophical issues.\n\nPrinters and publishers also offered another kind of flexibility in an era in which texts were printed and transported unbound, and then bound by the purchaser. In 1546, the press of Cornelio Adelkind in Venice printed three medieval Hebrew texts that exist on the border of learned philosophy and popular ethics: _Beḥinat Olam_ ; _Mivḥar ha-Peninim_, a collection of aphorisms, anecdotes, and parables from rabbis and philosophers--attributed to Bedersi (although actually the work of Solomon ibn Gabirol); and Qalonymos ben Qalonymos’ _Even Boḥan_, a moral critique of Jewish life in early fourteenth century Provence, Italy, and northern Spain. Each work had its own title page complete with the identification of the printer and the year; and each work began in a new quire (that is no sheet printed contained pages from more than one of the texts), but the three texts were paginated consecutively: folio pages 1-43 constituted _Mivhar ha-Peninim_; 44-56 constituted _Beḥinat Olam,_ and 57-88 were _Even Boḥan_. Here, we see the title page of the _Even Boḥan_ edition, with the folio page number clearly indicated. A short trip up Interstate 95 would reveal a copy of the _Beḥinat Olam_ edition at the Jewish Theological Seminary, and separately bound copies of the _Mivḥar ha-Peninim_ and the _Beḥinat Olam_ editions at Yale University. At Harvard University, one can find a “complete” copy with all three texts bound together. Farther away, at the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem, one can find two “complete” copies; one copy with _Mivḥar ha-Peninim_ and \\_Even Boḥan\\_together (“missing” the middle section!); and one copy with _Mivḥar ha-Peninim_ alone. That is, one printing project in 1546 yields seven different potential “books” with five of the seven combinations attested in a survey of just five library collections.\n\n### The Fourth Rabbinic Bible, Printed in Venice 1568 by Giovanni di Gara\n\nPiet van Boxel\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Boxel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis was a reprint of the third edition produced in the years 1547-1548 by Cornelio Edel Kind (Israel Cornelius Adelkind) in the printing house of Daniel Bomberg. These editions known as \"_Mikraʼot gedolot_\" offer a variety of Jewish commentaries to the biblical text printed together with the Aramaic version.\n\nThe fourth Rabbinic Bible was the first to be censored according to the conditions stipulated by the Venetian authorities, but was almost immediately after its publication banned from the republic under the pretense that the publishers had violated the instructions for expurgation drafted by Jacopo Giraldino and that it contained “molte pravità”. That the real motives were merely political and the action against Hebrew books in 1568 retaliation for alleged Jewish hostilities against the Republic appears from the fact that the highest authorities of the Church used this censored edition as a model for censorship and expurgation. (See Vat. Lat. 14628, 250).\n\n### Isaac Casaubon's Midrash Samuel\n\nJoanna Weinberg\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Weinberg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis is the title-page of the second edition of the Midrash Shemuel (Venice, 1588) which was written by Samuel di Uceda, the Safed preacher and disciple of Isaac Luria (the Ari).This copy of the work belonged to Isaac Casaubon, the great Huguenot scholar (1559-1614).It is now housed in the British Library as are the majority of his extensive Hebraic and Judaic library. All the books in Casaubon’s possession not only displayed the owner’s signature, but also vividly manifested his order of reading and of taking notes.\n\n### _Ayyelet ha-shaḥar_ - The Morning Star\n\nMichela Andreatta\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Andreatta.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Andreatta2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n_Ayyelet ha-shaḥar_ is the breviary for the dawn vigil of the _Shomerim la-boker_ society of Italian rite of Mantua. As for other groups of this kind, its members used to gather daily, about a hour before dawn, to recite prayers and penitential hymns (_seliḥot_). The ceremony was aimed at hastening the restoration of the Jerusalem Temple and the messianic redemption, along the teachings of Palestinian _kabbalah_. As stated in the title page, the breviary was compiled by the Mantuan rabbi Mordecai Reuben Jarè - who was among the promoters of the founding of the society itself - and follows the _seder_ observed by its members. Besides a bulk of _piyyuṭim_ by poets of the classic period and medieval Spain, _Ayyelet ha-shaḥar_ also includes about forty compositions by modern authors, an element which greatly distinguishes it from traditional collections of _seliḥot_. Most of the authors who had their compositions included were directly connected with the Mantuan community and the society of watchers, like the rabbis Samuel Raphael Marli (d. 1617) and Hananiah Eliakim Rieti (d. 1623). Particularly, the _piyyuṭim_ by Rieti are drawn on his vast collection of liturgical poetry, _Minḥatḥananyah_ (_Hananiah’s Offering_), still extant in manuscript, and at the time a favourite reading among the devotional circles of Mantua. Some introductory and final notes by the people who took part in the work of compilation and printing accompany the texts, illustrating in the detail the nature of the collection and the aims of its promoters. A few occasional poems in praise of the prayer book and the confraternity contribute to the strong local imprint and flavour characterizing the compilation. For the reception, circulation and the influence it exerted on the following collections compiled and printed for the _Shomerim la-boker,Ayyelet ha-shaḥar_ is one of the most significant among the books commissioned for these societies. The breviary was finally reprinted in 1724, at the Mantuan press of Raphael Hayyim Italia, with the addition of the _piyyuṭim_ by Benjamin Ha-Kohen Vitale of Reggio (1651-1730) from the collection _‘Et ha-zamir_ (The season of the song), printed in Venice in 1707.\n\n### _Z’ena ur’ena_\n\nChava Turniansky\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Turniansky%20%281%29.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/zena-urena?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Turniansky2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/zena-urena?item=1)\n\nThe _Z’ena ur’ena_ \\[Hebrew צאינה וראינה, Yiddish pronunciation: _tsenerene_\\], Jacob ben Isaac Ashkenazi of Yanov’s Yiddish rendering of the Pentateuch, the Megillot and the Haftarot, is the most popular book in the history of Yiddish literature. It is based on a selection of versicles and topics from the biblical text treated in an exegetical and at times homiletically inclined manner, drawing from numerous sources, primarily the Midrash (first of all Bereshit Rabba) and the Talmud, Rashi and his interpreters, and many other exegets with R. Bahya ben Asher ibn Halawa in the lead, with a clear preference for _pshat_ but without refraining from combining it with _drash_.\n\nThe oldest extant edition of the _Z’ena ur’ena_, published in 1622 in Hanau (and not in Basel as stipulated in the frontispiece) mentions three preceeding editions (one printed in Lublin and two more in Cracow) already out of print. Over 210 editions have since appeared in Central and Eastern Europe, and later also in the United States and Israel.\n\nAlthough originally intended by its author for men and women alike, at a certain point in time unknown to us, the book sarted to be considered as the principal and fundamental reading matter for women, and played for many generations a major role in the informal education of women and their children by broadening their knowledge of many and various Hebrew sources, leading them in the ways of Jewish thought and behaviour, and presenting them with a treasure of stories and narratives. The _Z’ena ur’ena_ made a remarkable impact on its readers’ spiritual world, on their reading habits, on their literay taste and on their written and spoken language.\n\n### Yiddish Books and Their Publishers: Yosef Athias’s Yiddish Bible (Amsterdam 1679)\n\nShlomo Berger\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Berger.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/yiddish-books-and-their-publishers-yosef-athiass-yiddish?item=0)\n\n[\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Berger2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/yiddish-books-and-their-publishers-yosef-athiass-yiddish?item=1)\n\nPublishers do not sell texts (even that of the Bible) but books. In the age when books were offered to buyers without a hard-cover jacket (let alone in paperback), the title page functioned as a physical and metaphorical entrance into the book, and there the publisher was able to send out messages to diverse agents of the book that should have secured its success. Title pages, then, were not addressing the book’s potential reader alone.\n\nIndeed, in the two title pages added to Yosef Athias’s Yiddish Bible (Amsterdam 1679) several distinct publics were targeted. The first title page contains no text but rather images. They depict two biblical scenes (giving the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai, and most probably alluding to the publisher’s name, the meeting between Jacob and his lost son Yosef in Egypt), which are flanked by two biblical heroes: Moses and King David. These images are targeted at the Jewish reader. In the middle of the page, an emblem of the Dutch Republic is posted: it shows a lion with seven double edged spears, representing the seven provinces that composed the Dutch Republic. The emblem is accompanied with a political slogan employed in the Republic: _concordia res parvae crescent_ (or: in harmony small states grow mightier). The inclusion of the emblem is aimed at the local provincial authorities who provided the publisher with a privilege guaranteeing his monopoly selling the book. The second title page includes two different texts: in Hebrew for scholarly readers, rabbis and intellectual leaders who would support reading (and buying) this Yiddish Bible; and in Yiddish for the actual targeted reading public.\n\n### Jewish Book Culture and Bibliography\n\nSeth Jerchower\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Jerchower.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nShabbetai Bass was an itinerant printer and book monger, as well as commentator and author in his own right, whom Mortiz Steinschneider acknowledged as the \"father of Hebrew bibliography.\" Bass was the first Jewish bibliographer to produce a comprehensive classified catalogue of Hebrew and Jewish literature—the _Sifte yeshenim_ (Amsterdam, 1689). Although preceded in his endeavour by the _Promtuarium; sive, Bibliotheca orientalis_ (Heidelberg, 1658), of the Swiss Christian Semitist Johann Heinrich Hottinger (1620-1667), Bass' work is specifically Jewish, directed to a Jewish readership, and organized using criteria specific to contemporary Jewish thought.\n\nNonetheless, the idea of a classified bibliography can be said to be imported from contemporary European culture. Christian and Humanist classification theories are direct heirs to Greco-Roman methods, most notably seen through the _Pinakes_ of Callimachus of Cyrene (ca. 305 BC- ca. 240 BC), cataloguer of the fabled Library of Alexandria. This tradition can be said to culminate in the _Bibliotheca universalis_ (Zurich, 1545) and its supplemental _Pandectarum sive partitionum universalium_ (Zurich, 1548) by the Swiss naturalist cum bibliographer Conrad Gessner (1516-1565). These two works survey and classify into _portae_—\"doors\" to knowledge—the then-known sum of the literature of the _vir trilinguis_ ideal, comprising Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. While Gessner organized Hebrew literature into his universal bibliography, Hottinger's _Promtuarium_ was the first work to address classification issues relating to the literature of a particular organic nature, according to language and culture.\n\nThere is evidence from the Cairo Genizah and from Jewish medieval manuscripts that notions of classification were used within Jewish cultural contexts, but these appear sporadically, with little indication of direct transmission other than that already indicated by Avot 1:1 (\"Moses received the Torah from Sinai,and passed it on to Joshua; and Joshua to the elders, and the elders to the prophets; and the prophets passed it on to men of the Great Assembly...\" implying Bible and Talmud as dual systems of Torah \"she-bi-khtav\" and \"she-be-\\`al peh\", each with their own respective hierarchies of commentary and super-commentary). Theories of knowledge received much more attention and were published, but it was still not until Bass that a synthesis of areas of knowledge and bibliographic organization were systematically synthesized, and the bulk of Jewish literature therein arranged by title.\n\nIn this sense, the _Sifte yeshenim_ seems to spontaneously emerge. To be sure, Bass acknowledges the authors whose works he consulted. The closing section, entitled _Sha‘ar ha-ḥitsoni_, is a lengthy listing of the works consulted by Bass, nearly all of them the fruit of Christian Hebraism (Bass succinctly credits Hottinger and his _Promtuarium_ \\[fol. 107a\\], \"And here he records a great many books, placed in order according to subject.\" Although Gessner is nowhere cited, Bass calls his class headings \"sha\\`arim\" (gates, portals). Some 35 year later, the _Sifte yeshenim_ would serve as the foundation for the massive four volume\\_Bibliotheca hebraea\\_(Hamburg, 1715-1733) of Johann Christoph Wolf (1683-1739).\n\nWhat prompted this sudden appearance? From the advent of Hebrew printing in the late 1460s up to the 1670s, technological, economic, and demographic changes had contributed to utterly change the culture of Jewish letters, of how books were produced and distributed. The printing press had made vast numbers of titles and copies available. With political upheavals and ecclesiastic censorship, older collections and their contents were brought back to light, often being redistributed into new collections. It can be argued that Jewish bibliophilia began during the 16th century, as both personal and communal collections developed. Bass arrived in Amsterdam to marvel at what can be said to be the first true Jewish Library, the Ets Haim Livraria Montezinos, founded in 1616. In a Borges-meets-Canetti kind of way: every library needs its catalogue, and every printer/monger, his inventory.\n\n### Moses in Persia\n\nVera Moreen\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Moreen_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nJudeo-Persian miniature paintings reflect traditional late and provincial styles of medieval Persian miniature paintings. However, from the point of view of content, they are unique as most of them illustrate biblical and midrashic scenes adorning original Judeo-Persian epics. Many of these scenes have no iconographic equivalents in western or eastern pictorial traditions.\n\nA lovely example is a miniature painting from the late seventeenth-century _Musa-namah_ &\\[#8216;Book of Moses’\\] of the Judeo-Persian poet Shahin (fl. 14th century). It is taken from a manuscripts from the Israel Musem (180/54, fol. 102v), and shows Moses in heaven among the angels while receiving the Torah. He holds the tablets and is surrounded by angels sporting Mongol topknots. Unlike other miniatures in this ms. which depict Moses veiled, here he appears unveiled despite the closeness to the divine Presence.\n\n### Book of the Angel Raziel\n\nJoel Hecker\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Hecker.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThis well-known image--from _Sefer Raziel ha-Mal’akh_, the _Book of the Angel Raziel_\\--is an amulet designed to protect mothers during childbirth from the lethal attacks of Lilith, queen of the demons. According to ancient legend Lilith, once banished from her initial relationship with Adam, swore vengeance against the offspring resulting from Adam and Eve’s union. The strange figures at the top of the amulet represent three angels Sanvei, Sansanvei, and Semenglof who were sent to warn Lilith that she and her cohort should not disturb any laboring mother if their own images were to be found there. This tale clearly emerges as a promotion for childbirth amulets and various practices arose in medieval through early modern Ashkenaz in which these angels names would be emblazoned upon the walls of laboring rooms.\n\nOther amulets offering protection or grace appear in _Sefer Raziel ha-Mal’akh_, an anthology of mystical and magical, ancient and medieval fragments, first printed in Amsterdam 1701. The book originated in legendary form, in which the angel Raziel delivers a book to Adam after the latter’s expulsion from Eden. When Adam is lamenting his fate by the riverside, God dispatches Raziel with a book that will offer protection from the wilds of nature. At some point in medieval history various forms of this book began to take shape, with its contents remaining in flux until the printing in 1701. Because one of the ancient fragments in the book claims that the owner of the book will be protected from fire and other natural and supernatural ills, the printer exploited this detail, placing it on the book’s frontispiece resulting in the book enjoying considerable distribution and success as an amulet. Following the Six-Day War, miniaturized forms of the book circulated first among Israeli soldiers and subsequently in Sephardi and Haredi sectors of the Jewish community. Indeed, miniaturization has facilitated the development of yet a further legend--that the book should not be read at all!\n\n### Nahalat Tsvi: the Popular Yiddish Zohar\n\nJean Baumgarten\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Baumgarten.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nFrom the 17th and the 18th centuries in Ahkenazi society, we observe a popularization of mysticism with the multiplication of ethical-kabbalistic texts. The translation of parts of the Zohar in Yiddish, called _Nahalat Tsvi_ or _Taytsh-Zoyer_ (Frankfurt-am-Main, 1711, reprinted about 50 times until the begining of the 20th Century) by Tsvi Hirsh ben Yerahmiel Chotsch shows the diffusion of kabbalistic tradition to simple Jews. The translator did not retain the esoterical and philosophical interpretations, but the ethical lessons and the narratives parts. The Zohar in Yiddish was read and commented during individual and collective readings among circles of shabbateans. This page shows the begining of the Parashat Bereshit.\n\n### Leghorn vs. Florence\n\nFrancesca Bregoli\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Bregoli.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe activity of Hebrew printing in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany was initially regulated by protectionist State licenses, meant to safeguard the interests of entrepreneurs who ventured into an underdeveloped and little lucrative field. The Christian printer Francesco Moücke successfully obtained an exclusive privilege (monopolio) to print and sell texts in Hebrew and Rashi typefaces in the whole State of Tuscany on December 1, 1734 from the Grand Duke Gian Gastone de’ Medici. Moücke is well known for his activity as a printer of art and literature works, and his connections to the intellectual Florentine milieu of the first half of the 18th century. He also happened to be the first to resume Hebrew printing in Tuscany, where practically no Hebrew books had appeared since 1658. The Grand Duke Peter Leopold of the Hapsburg-Lorraine house abolished the monopoly relative to Hebrew and Rashi printing in 1767, to promote the business of printing in the same spirit of free market economy that characterized other Livornese commercial activities. While Florence never became a center of Hebrew printing, in fact, the activity developed in Livorno from 1740: slowly and discontinuously at first, but with increasing success from the 1780s on. The Livornese Jewish government, on its part, attempted to regulate and discipline the activity of Hebrew printers more than the secular Tuscan authorities. The Sefer ha-Rashbash, printed by Abraham Meldola (Livorno 1742), provides the first example of the procedure that the Livornese Jewish government went through in order to approve a text for publication: 1) the Parnassim ordered the bet din to check the text and see if they found it publishable; 2) the appointed rabbis sent back their reply to the Parnassim and agreed to write an haskamah to the text; 3) the Parnassim approved it, giving permission to the printer to publish the work and to the rabbis of the community to write their haskamah. In the same year, Meldola petitioned the Grand Duke to command the Jewish government to “give up their pretensions” at controlling his activity, and allow him to print without the previous approval of the Parnassim. The Tuscan authorities granted his plea; however, subsequent Hebrew printers apparently kept submitting their books for approval and the practice was reintroduced.\n\n### _Toldot Ya'akov Yosef_, Koretz 1780\n\nMoshe Rosman\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Rosman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nGenerally regarded as the first Hasidic book, _Toldot Ya'akov Yosef_ illustrates some of the features that typified Hasidic books. Common for these books, its genre was homiletics (_drash_), based on both the weekly Torah portion and the 613 commandments. While the origin of these _drashot_ was probably oral lessons given in Yiddish by Rabbi Ya'akov Yosef of Polonne, one of the chief disciple-associates of Israel Ba'al Shem Tov (Besht), the founder of Hasidism, the book (like most early Hasidic books) was written in Hebrew. Rabbi Ya'akov Yosef is credited as author, however a printer's note at the end of the book makes it clear that the book was compiled from various notes he had written. This and the problematic state of the text (the lack of proper introduction, material that appears to be out of order, repetitions, etc.) indicate that Rabbi Ya'akov Yosef, who was approaching his death at the time of publication, did not submit a publishable text to the printer. Rather it appears that his notes were edited by one or more of the publishers (_mevi'im le-veit ha-defus_): his son Avraham Shimshon of Rashkov, his son-in-law, Avraham Dov of Chmelnik, Shimon Ashkenazi and Shelomo Lutzker. In this way the editor or editors were actually coauthors of the text. This is usual with Hasidic books, where the named author rarely wrote a finished manuscript. Most of the time the published book appeared after the putative author's death and represented his miscellaneous writings or oral teachings as recorded or later recalled by his associates. This raw material was then edited into a book after his death, its message shaped by the editors.\n\nIn the case of R. Ya'akov Yosef's books (there were four in all) the publisher-editors apparently wanted to emphasize to potential readers that reading these books would enable them to learn not only the teachings of R. Ya'akov Yosef, but also of the Besht himself. In a long note on the verso of the title page they stressed the relationship between the Besht and R. Ya'akov Yosef. In the book itself they typographically highlighted all of the sayings that R. Ya'akov Yosef cited as his having heard directly from the Besht or in the holy man's name, and at the end of the book they appended an additional series of Besht sayings that they found among R. Yaakov Yosef's papers.\n\nPictured here is the first page of the text proper, after the introductory material or paratexts. Note how the traditions originating from the Besht begin with bold letters, five in all.\n\n### American Rabbinic Imprints, 1881-1939: The Paratext as Social History\n\nMenahem Blondheim\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Blondheim.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\nThe two neat piles of seven Hebrew rabbinic books shown here differ greatly in girth; one is of tombs “fat in flesh,” the other of volumes “lean and ill-favored.” But these 14 books were in fact assorted into two groups by a non-material, if significant, attribute. While they all were published between 1900-1910—near the middle of this study's time-frame— the set of larger 'sphorim' is a representative sample of books published in eastern Europe, the small set is representative of 'sphorim' published in America.\n\nThe striking change in the physique of traditional Hebrew rabbinical works upon the immigration of their authors to America, is only one in a series of novelties marking American rabbinic book culture. The unique features of Jewish American rabbinic books, my CAJS study suggests, can serve as a key to understanding broader social, cultural, and religious meanings of the encounter between America and traditional Jews and Judaism. It can also sharpen our understanding of the relationship between print and society generally.\n\nThe radically diminished size of the average rabbinic book in America serves to illustrate these broader concerns. A preliminary explanation would point to economic factors. And indeed, Hebrew publishing in America at the time cost roughly twice as much as in Eastern Europe, and a third more than in Palestine. But other explanations suggest themselves, and among them the seldom considered aspect of time-to-market is particularly revealing. American rabbis accumulated much less text than their European counterparts before going to the printer; and their manuscripts tended to represent more ephemeral rabbinic genres such as sermons, responsa, and polemics.\n\nThus, there seems to have been a sense of urgency driving American authors to publish their rabbinic works. One aspect of it may have been personal: joining a chaotic assemblage of simpletons and scholars evacuating Europe, individual rabbis tried to establish their credentials and publicize their potential competence and authority to deal with the challenges of the new social and intellectual milieu as it was taking shape. They tried to introduce themselves to, and communicate with, their new peers by means of the printing press. Other features of American rabbinic works, such as authors publishing their ordinations in their books, and other telling paratexts to the same effect, underscore this dynamic.\n\nMoreover, American rabbis in their sermons and responsa, commentaries and polemics, were responding to the novel challenges America presented to traditional Judaism. Rabbis hurried with the recipes they proposed for religious survival to the print market, hoping to engage colleagues and public with their timely responses to the transformation of Jewish life in America.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Amnon Raz-Krokotzkin.** _Tsenzurah ke-gorem me’atsev: ha-tsenzurah ha-Katolit veha-sifrut ha-\\`Ivrit ba-me\\`ah ha-16._ (Yerushalayim : ha-Universitah ha-‘Ivrit, 1989)\n    \n*   **Avrin, Leila.** _Scribes, Script and Books: The Book Arts from Antiquity to the Renaissance_.

During the past year (2005-06), the Fellows at CAJS explored the Jewish book as an historical agent in Jewish culture and as a medium of exchange within the larger cultures in which Jews have lived. Their work drew upon a variety of inter-disciplinary perspectives with the aim of uniting scholars working in the traditional fields of Jewish studies with scholars of the history of the book.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Among the questions these scholars grappled with were: How have the materiality and formatting of texts from antiquity to the present shaped authorship, reception, interpretation, and transmission? How have the business of Jewish book production and the market forces of book consumption affected Jewish life and culture? How have the visual art and design of Jewish books shaped reading habits, legibility, recollection, and signification? How have cultures of Jewish reading changed over time, creating new forms of social experience while testing communal authority as well as gender boundaries? What has been the fate of Jewish books, libraries, book producers, publishers, and readers, under conditions of censorship and persecution? We hope you enjoy this exhibition which offers you some choice selections of the first fruits of their ground-breaking research.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"arthur-kiron\">Arthur Kiron\u003C/h4>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-advent-of-the-jewish-book\">The Advent of the Jewish Book\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Malachi Beit-Arie\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/advent-jewish-book?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Beit-Arie.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/advent-jewish-book?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Beit-Arie2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The extraordinary historical circumstances, which scattered the Jewish communities around the Mediterranean basin and further eastward, northward, and westward, brought them into contact with diversified civilizations, religions, and societies. As a result, Hebrew manuscripts are cross-cultural agents and significant artifacts for studying the history of the handwritten book in all the other civilizations around the Mediterranean, predominantly those of Islam and Christianity. Due to the far flung territorial dispersion of the Jews, and their adherence to their national script, medieval manuscripts written in Hebrew characters were produced in a territorial range larger than that of their Greek, Latin, or even Arabic counterparts, as Hebrew handwritten books were manufactured and disseminated within and across all these main and other, more minor, booklore zones. In contrast to Christian society, where literacy was concentrated among clerics and aristocrats, Jewish society was largely classless, and literacy was widespread. Extensive book consumption and a remarkably high rate of user-produced books, which was initiated not by intellectual or academic establishments but privately, inevitably resulted in a relatively high rate of book production.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The number of surviving medieval books of the Jewish minority is naturally much smaller than that of extant Latin or Arabic ones. However, the extant Hebrew manuscripts probably represent only a small proportion of the total Jewish book production, very likely much smaller than the proportion of Latin manuscripts relative to total Latin book production. The loss of most of the codices was not the consequence of historical conditions alone. Hebrew books were destroyed or abandoned not only through wanderings, emigrations, persecutions, and expulsions, or confiscated and burned in Christian countries; they were above all worn out by use. Unlike Latin, Greek and, to a certain degree, Arabic books, they were not preserved either in well-protected royal or aristocratic collections or in monasteries, mosques, or religious or academic institutions, but were privately owned and used.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Moreover, the roughly 100,000 extant medieval Hebrew codices and their fragments represent the book production output of only the last six centuries of the Middle Ages. The revolutionary codex form of the book, which was adopted and diffused by Christians already in the first centuries of our era and replaced the old roll form in the areas around the Mediterranean from about 300, was employed by the Jews much later, as is attested both by findings and by textual evidence. Between the abundant finds of Hebrew books from Late Antiquity b rt of the Hellenistic and early Roman period b some eight hundred years almost without evidence of the Hebrew book, in either roll or codex form. The earliest extant categorically dated Hebrew codices were written at the beginning of the tenth century, all of them in the Middle East. However, in the structural, figural, and artistic design of the copied texts, in their harmonious scripts and shared styles, and in the mature employment of codicological practices, these earliest manuscripts demonstrate elaborate craftsmanship and regularity, surely attesting to a long-established tradition of codex design and production.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From the eleventh century on, dated manuscripts have survived also from Italy and the Maghreb, while those produced in the Iberian Peninsula, France, Germany, England, and Byzantium date from the twelfth century on. Until the middle of the thirteenth century their number, mainly produced outside the Middle East, is rather small; but it increases thereafter, reaching a peak in the fifteenth century. Thus the history of the medieval Hebrew book and of Hebrew palaeography and codicology is largely confined to the high and late Middle Ages. The dated manuscripts furnish us with solid knowledge of the crystallized types of Hebrew book scripts, scribal practices, and codicological techniques in the high and late Middle Ages in the Islamic East, where the Arabic script was employed, in the Christian West, where the Latin script was used, and in the Byzantine zone, where the Greek script was used. They enable us to unfold the rich variety of their traditions and styles evolving over space and time and to draw a firm typology of the hand-produced Hebrew book.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All the earliest extant hand-written Hebrew codices of the tenth and the early-eleventh- century are biblical. They bear witness to the large-scale project of producing and disseminating the massoretic version of the vocalized and accentuated Bible as was forged in Tiberias in Palestine by generations of experts of the transmission of the authentic text of the biblical books. The adoption of the codex form by the Jews coincided with the crystallization of the Massoretic version of the Hebrew Bible. Scribes and vocalizers in the Orient were engaged in fixing the biblical texts in codex form and disseminating them on a large scale. The remarkable scope of this production and diffusion has become known to us only recently, following the dramatic accessibility of the rich collections of the Russian National Library (formerly the Saltykov-Shchedrin State Public Library) in St. Petersburg, where some two thousand surviving biblical codices, or their fragments, are kept, many of which have been found to date from the tenth and eleventh centuries. The text of these codices, as in those which followed them in all the other regions of the East and West, was accompanied by the Massora, lexical and grammatical annotations pertaining to spelling, vocalization, and accentuation, intended to safeguard the accurate transmission of the biblical text. These complex notations were written in detail in a minute script on the upper and lower margins, while much shorter and abbreviated notations were written between the columns and on the inner and outer margins. At the beginning, the Massoretic annotations were probably written by the scholarly massoretes themselves, as in the case of the famous Aleppo Codex, which was vocalized, accentuated and massoreted in Palestine around 930 by the most important massorete, Aharon ben Asher, himself. Soon after, the complicated task of matching the copying of the annotations to the relevant text while disposing them in aesthetic patterns was left to scribes or vocalizers, who as early as the tenth century exploited the secondary text as a decorative device. Later, scribes or vocalizers enhanced this visual manipulation of the Massora still further, sketching not only sophisticated abstract geometrical and floral interlaced ornamentation, as can be seen in plate 18, but also elaborate zoomorphic and anthropomorphic images, even illustrations to the biblical text The secondary text lost its verbal meaning altogether, and was transformed into a sheer visually expressive tool.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The earliest surviving dated manuscript of the whole Bible, which was selected for this exhibition as a remarkable representative of the early Hebrew book production, is kept in the National Library of Russia in St. Petersburg, MS EBP. IIB 19a, produced in Cairo in 1008 by the prestigious scribe Shemuel ben Ya’aqov. The images display the artistic and scribal craft facet of those bibles produced in the Middle East at the outset of the Jewish codex. Fol. 73v displays a decorated carpet-page of Massoretic text, while fol. 478r shows one of the ornamented parts of the multi-pages colophon of the scribe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"jewish-letters-before-the-codex\">Jewish Letters Before the Codex\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Marc Bregman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/jewish-letters-codex?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Bregman.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/jewish-letters-codex?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/4486_0000_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fragments of non-biblical texts, mostly recovered from the Cairo Genizah that were committed to writing in horizontal scrolls similar to Torah scrolls seem to represent early versions of the texts they preserve, including Talmud, Midrash and other post-biblical genres of Hebrew writing. Only very few of these fragments have been published or discussed in the scholarly literature. One of these is a fragment of a very early version of Avot de-Rabbi Natan that seems to have been copied before the Islamic conquests of the Near East and may represent the earliest fragment of rabbinic literature that has so far come to light.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The second manuscript displayed here is a palimpsest. The lower Greek text seems to preserve a sixth century transcription of the New Testament Book of Acts.. The upper Hebrew text preserves an early midrash on Genesis 40:18-41:3, 46:28-47:1 copied in the 10th century or earlier. This text is similar to, but not identical with, Midrash Genesis Rabbah on the same biblical passages, and therefore represents an early and important addition to our knowledge of rabbinic biblical interpretation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"a-bible-from-the-genizah\">A Bible from the Genizah\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>David Stern\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/bible-genizah?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Stern.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/bible-genizah?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Stern2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These two images are the recto and verso of a single folio surviving from an early Bible codex written in the Near East in the 10th century. The folio was found in the famous Cairo Genizah in the Ben-Ezra synagogue in Fustat (Old Cairo) and came to Penn as part of the Dropsie College Genizah collection acquired at the beginning of the last century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The codex from which this folio derived is a typical example of a Masoretic Bible, known after its producers, the Masoretes or ba’alei ha-mesorah, who were also the authors of the scribal annotations known as the Masorah and whose Biblical text has become, in one of its several versions, the canonical text of the Bible. The Masoretic codices are also the earliest surviving Jewish codices, and effectively mark the transition in Jewish culture from the scroll to the book-form we use today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The typical page of the Masoretic codex, fully represented in this folio, inscribes that moment of transition between the two mediums of book-technology. The Biblical text is arranged in three columns that imitate the traditional form of a Torah scroll, albeit on a page, and as in a Torah-scroll, the text is written in the formal square, so-called Assyrian letters. In the codex, however, the text also contains vowelization points beneath the letters as well as the te’amim, the accentuation marks both beneath and above them. In addition, the codex contains the Masoretic notes in its two traditional forms— on the one hand, the masorah ketanah (masorah parva) in the abbreviations recorded in the space between the columns; and on the other, the masorah gedolah (masorah magna), in the two lines at the top of the page and the two lines at the bottom. Both types of notes, written in micrography or miniscule writing, record and enumerate all the peculiarities and singular features of the Biblical text, presumably in order to safeguard its accurate transmission though they may also have served an early exegetical function.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The page format of these early codices provides the basic model for numerous Bible manuscripts produced throughout the Middle Ages as well as the text and the annotations preserved in the printed Bibles known as the Miqraot Gedolot or Rabbinic Bible. To this day, the Masoretic Bible remains the basic text that defines what we call the Jewish Bible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-lobed-mazzot-of-the-birds-head-haggadah\">The Lobed Mazzot of the Birds’ Head Haggadah\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Naomi Feuchtwanger-Sarig\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Sarig.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The oldest surviving illuminated Passover \u003Cem>Haggadah\u003C/em> from \u003Cem>Ashkenaz\u003C/em> is the well-known “Birds’ Head Haggadah” from the Upper Rhine region of Germany. Copied and decorated around 1300, it presents a close-to-complete text of the \u003Cem>Seder\u003C/em> ritual as it is celebrated today. The \u003Cem>Haggadah\u003C/em> contains mainly marginal illustrations, which not only illuminate the text, but also serve as didactic visual portrayals of the ceremony and the customs connected to it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The anonymous artist of the \u003Cem>Haggadah\u003C/em> clearly distinguished between two types of \u003Cem>mazzot\u003C/em>: the three “precept \u003Cem>mazzot\u003C/em>” and those that do not serve any ritual function. He was clearly familiar with the order in which the \u003Cem>mazzot\u003C/em> are to be used. Appropriately, he marked them with the respective number of lobes protruding from their circumference, in perfect correlation to the \u003Cem>minhag\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Portraying part of the ritual preceding the meal, the artist appended two marginal images to this page. The man at the top seems to be preparing, stirring or forking the bitter herbs for the \u003Cem>maror,\u003C/em> to be eaten while reciting the appropriate benediction. In the lower margin, the illustration depicts the ensuing ritual in the progression of the \u003Cem>Seder\u003C/em>. Following the eating of the \u003Cem>maror\u003C/em>, one is instructed to take a combination of condiments, in fulfillment of \u003Cem>Korekh\u003C/em>. In keeping with the tradition laid down by Hillel in the first century of the Common Era, some greens (“\u003Cem>Leituga”\u003C/em>, or lettuce) and a bit of the third \u003Cem>mazzah\u003C/em> are eaten together.

Accordingly, when depicting the moment in which the first \u003Cem>mazzah\u003C/em> is taken, the cake shown by the artist has one protuberance, while the second and third _mazzot_are marked respectively with two or three lobes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First referred to in writing as “marks” or “signs” in the twelfth century, the lobed \u003Cem>mazzot\u003C/em> are visually manifested for the first time in the “Bird’s Head Haggadah”.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"a-hebrew-florentine-manuscript-commissioned-by-the-medici-family\">A Hebrew Florentine Manuscript Commissioned by the Medici Family\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Nurit Pasternak\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Pasternak.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>MS Jerusalem, Israel Museum 180/55 contains the liturgical biblical corpus of Psalms, Job and Proverbs, named \u003Cem>Sifrei Emet.\u003C/em> This tiny volume (measuring 95X65 mm) made of the finest parchment was produced in mid fifteenth-century Florence by one of the most prestigious, skilled and prolific Italian Hebrew scribes known to us. Although the manuscript bears no colophon, both the elegant Italian semi-cursive writing and the manuscript’s codicological and palaeographical features disclose the hand and the craft of Yitzhaq ben Ovadia ben David of Forli, who had been active in Florence for some three decades, ever since 1441.

Furthermore, a close study of his work seems to attest that in many aspects he led the way for Hebrew scribes in the adoption and integration of the local book-craft practices of their Christian environment, some of which had gradually become, in the course of the \u003Cem>Quattrocento\u003C/em>, the current practices of Hebrew manuscript production in Italy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A salient feature of Isaac’s manuscripts is their rich decoration: some, such as the Israel Museum’s \u003Cem>Sifrei Emet\u003C/em> codex, include full-page miniatures, decorated panels, broad illuminated borders with floral and foliate ornaments, medallions, putti, birds of all sorts, peacocks, bees, lions and deers; and, in the finest manuscripts – human figures. All manuscripts belonging to this category of elaborate decoration contain gold, some bear family coats-of-arms or emblems. No doubt the typical Florentine style of the illuminated borders and miniatures indicates they had been executed by local Christian artists and workshops.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>MS Israel Museum, in addition to three full-page miniatures (featuring David triumphant over Goliath, Job, and King Solomon in Judgment), encloses a richly ornamented frontispiece which holds a unique attestation to Medici ownership: at the bottom of the frame, the family device consisting of a diamond ring with three feathers, white pink and green (possibly representing the young Lorenzo the Magnificent who had just come into power) and beneath – the motto \u003Cem>semper\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-jewish-humanist-library-in-italy\">The Jewish Humanist Library in Italy\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Federica Francesconi\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/jewish-humanist-library-italy?item=0\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Francesconi.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723mp_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/jewish-book/jewish-humanist-library-italy?item=1\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Francesconi2.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The banker Moisè Modena (1539-1630) owned a library, which in 1599 consisted of 100 titles of Latin and Italian books and 145 titles of Hebrew books. He was neither a rabbi nor a famous scholar or physician, but a wealthy and –probably– a cultured man. The two sons, the famous kabbalist Aharon Berechiah (1576-1639) and Salomone (1583-?) respectively of 24 and 17 years old, the former was already rabbi and the second not yet. In his library we can see perhaps some lines of the classical background of an acculturated Jew who lived at the turn of the 16th century to 17th century: from the commentaries of Rashi to _Sefer Ha-Kuzari_and \u003Cem>Me’or ʻenayim\u003C/em>, from Francesco Petrarca to Marsilio Ficino. What seems particularly interesting about the library of Moisè Modena is the possibility to distinguish a certain concrete connection between Jewish culture, the Medieval and Renaissance basic texts, and the general Italian culture of his time. In the library of Moisè Modena we can find in fact the classical works \u003Cem>Masoret ha-masoret\u003C/em> of ’Elie ha-Levi Ashkenazi, \u003Cem>Diqduqe\u003C/em> of Rashi, \u003Cem>Sefer ha-shorashim\u003C/em> of David Qimhi (Venice, 1542) and the rethoric treatise \u003Cem>Nofet Sufim\u003C/em> of Judah Messer Leone. Furthermore, we can see Jewish classic medieval works like \u003Cem>Sefer ha-Kuzari\u003C/em> of Judah ha-Levi, an the the late medieval book like \u003Cem>Or ‘ammin\u003C/em> of Obadia Sforno (Bologna, 1537), the \u003Cem>Or ha-Shem\u003C/em> of Hasday Crescas and a group of more Humanistic oriented books such as \u003Cem>Minkhat kenaot\u003C/em> of Yehiel Nissim da Pisa and the \u003Cem>Me’or ʻenayim\u003C/em> of Azaria de Rossi.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Moisè Modena’ library shows two different cultural trends in the libraries of the Modenese Jewish intelligentsia: books on Italian rhetoric and the so-called line of “humaniores litterae”. In fact he owned \u003Cem>Il presente libro insegna la vera arte delo excellente scrivere\u003C/em> of Giovanni Antonio Tagliente (Venice, 1524), the \u003Cem>Applicamento de i precetti della inuentione, dispositione, et elocutione, che propriamente serue allo scrittore di epistole latine, et volgari\u003C/em> of Oratio Toscanella, and specifically regarding the rethoric and the so-called line of “humaniores litterae” he had bought: Prose of Pietro Bembo (\u003Cem>nelle quali si ragiona della volgar lingua scritte al cardinale de Medici,\u003C/em> Venice, 1525), \u003Cem>Tabulae totius dialectices aliarum artiuminstrumenti praecepta vtilissima breuiter complectentes, ordine perspicuo digestae a Cornelio Valerio\u003C/em> (Venice, 1564), the \u003Cem>Dialectica Ioannis\u003C/em> Antonii Delphini (Venice, 1555), \u003Cem>Quattro lettere di monsig.

This was, in essence, the same kind of endeavor as the goal of self-improvement promulgated in ethical or moralizing literature. Philosophy and \u003Cem>musar\u003C/em> existed on an imagined spectrum of erudition. In fact, however, many of the authors were the same, and their works could be marketed on different levels to different audiences. It is important to understand that printers, editors, publishers, commentators aimed at a “popular” audience in the sense that they wanted the readership of printed books to be as wide as possible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bedersi’s \u003Cem>Beḥinat Olam\u003C/em> [Examination of the World], a philosophical meditation on the wonders and the vanities of the world, was written in Spain the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century, and became one of the most popular works of medieval Jewish thought in the early modern period and was reprinted often from the fifteenth through the eighteenth centuries. Here, we see the opening pages of two mid-sixteenth century editions from northern Italy. In 1551/52, one of the first products of the ibn Askara press in Ferrara was a quarto edition of the work, with the text of \u003Cem>Beḥinat Olam\u003C/em> printed with \u003Cem>nikud\u003C/em> (vowel points). Along with the text, we also find new introductions and commentaries by Moses ibn Habib and Joseph Frances. This edition was presumably aimed at a scholarly audience looking for quarto editions and good commentaries. At the same time, the presence of \u003Cem>nikud\u003C/em> in the text alongside the learned commentaries suggests an availability of the work to a less learned audience. Four years later, the press of Jacob ben Naftali ha-Kohen in Mantua issued an edition with a vocalized text as well as a reprint of the short, anonymous commentary included in the 1484 Soncino edition. This edition, in octavo and with a shorter commentary, appears to have been intended as a popular work.\u003Cem>Beḥinat Olam\u003C/em> could be presented to audiences as a poetic appreciation of God’s world or as the vehicle for discussion of serious philosophical issues.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Printers and publishers also offered another kind of flexibility in an era in which texts were printed and transported unbound, and then bound by the purchaser. In 1546, the press of Cornelio Adelkind in Venice printed three medieval Hebrew texts that exist on the border of learned philosophy and popular ethics: \u003Cem>Beḥinat Olam\u003C/em> ; \u003Cem>Mivḥar ha-Peninim\u003C/em>, a collection of aphorisms, anecdotes, and parables from rabbis and philosophers—attributed to Bedersi (although actually the work of Solomon ibn Gabirol); and Qalonymos ben Qalonymos’ \u003Cem>Even Boḥan\u003C/em>, a moral critique of Jewish life in early fourteenth century Provence, Italy, and northern Spain. Each work had its own title page complete with the identification of the printer and the year; and each work began in a new quire (that is no sheet printed contained pages from more than one of the texts), but the three texts were paginated consecutively: folio pages 1-43 constituted \u003Cem>Mivhar ha-Peninim\u003C/em>; 44-56 constituted \u003Cem>Beḥinat Olam,\u003C/em> and 57-88 were \u003Cem>Even Boḥan\u003C/em>. Here, we see the title page of the \u003Cem>Even Boḥan\u003C/em> edition, with the folio page number clearly indicated. A short trip up Interstate 95 would reveal a copy of the \u003Cem>Beḥinat Olam\u003C/em> edition at the Jewish Theological Seminary, and separately bound copies of the \u003Cem>Mivḥar ha-Peninim\u003C/em> and the \u003Cem>Beḥinat Olam\u003C/em> editions at Yale University. At Harvard University, one can find a “complete” copy with all three texts bound together. Farther away, at the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem, one can find two “complete” copies; one copy with \u003Cem>Mivḥar ha-Peninim\u003C/em> and _Even Boḥan_together (“missing” the middle section!); and one copy with \u003Cem>Mivḥar ha-Peninim\u003C/em> alone. That is, one printing project in 1546 yields seven different potential “books” with five of the seven combinations attested in a survey of just five library collections.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-fourth-rabbinic-bible-printed-in-venice-1568-by-giovanni-di-gara\">The Fourth Rabbinic Bible, Printed in Venice 1568 by Giovanni di Gara\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Piet van Boxel\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Boxel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>This was a reprint of the third edition produced in the years 1547-1548 by Cornelio Edel Kind (Israel Cornelius Adelkind) in the printing house of Daniel Bomberg.

That the real motives were merely political and the action against Hebrew books in 1568 retaliation for alleged Jewish hostilities against the Republic appears from the fact that the highest authorities of the Church used this censored edition as a model for censorship and expurgation.

As for other groups of this kind, its members used to gather daily, about a hour before dawn, to recite prayers and penitential hymns (\u003Cem>seliḥot\u003C/em>). The ceremony was aimed at hastening the restoration of the Jerusalem Temple and the messianic redemption, along the teachings of Palestinian \u003Cem>kabbalah\u003C/em>. As stated in the title page, the breviary was compiled by the Mantuan rabbi Mordecai Reuben Jarè - who was among the promoters of the founding of the society itself - and follows the \u003Cem>seder\u003C/em> observed by its members. Besides a bulk of \u003Cem>piyyuṭim\u003C/em> by poets of the classic period and medieval Spain, \u003Cem>Ayyelet ha-shaḥar\u003C/em> also includes about forty compositions by modern authors, an element which greatly distinguishes it from traditional collections of \u003Cem>seliḥot\u003C/em>. Most of the authors who had their compositions included were directly connected with the Mantuan community and the society of watchers, like the rabbis Samuel Raphael Marli (d. 1617) and Hananiah Eliakim Rieti (d. 1623). Particularly, the \u003Cem>piyyuṭim\u003C/em> by Rieti are drawn on his vast collection of liturgical poetry, \u003Cem>Minḥatḥananyah\u003C/em> (\u003Cem>Hananiah’s Offering\u003C/em>), still extant in manuscript, and at the time a favourite reading among the devotional circles of Mantua. Some introductory and final notes by the people who took part in the work of compilation and printing accompany the texts, illustrating in the detail the nature of the collection and the aims of its promoters. A few occasional poems in praise of the prayer book and the confraternity contribute to the strong local imprint and flavour characterizing the compilation. For the reception, circulation and the influence it exerted on the following collections compiled and printed for the \u003Cem>Shomerim la-boker,Ayyelet ha-shaḥar\u003C/em> is one of the most significant among the books commissioned for these societies.

This tradition can be said to culminate in the \u003Cem>Bibliotheca universalis\u003C/em> (Zurich, 1545) and its supplemental \u003Cem>Pandectarum sive partitionum universalium\u003C/em> (Zurich, 1548) by the Swiss naturalist cum bibliographer Conrad Gessner (1516-1565). These two works survey and classify into \u003Cem>portae\u003C/em>—“doors” to knowledge—the then-known sum of the literature of the \u003Cem>vir trilinguis\u003C/em> ideal, comprising Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. While Gessner organized Hebrew literature into his universal bibliography, Hottinger’s \u003Cem>Promtuarium\u003C/em> was the first work to address classification issues relating to the literature of a particular organic nature, according to language and culture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is evidence from the Cairo Genizah and from Jewish medieval manuscripts that notions of classification were used within Jewish cultural contexts, but these appear sporadically, with little indication of direct transmission other than that already indicated by Avot 1:1 (“Moses received the Torah from Sinai,and passed it on to Joshua; and Joshua to the elders, and the elders to the prophets; and the prophets passed it on to men of the Great Assembly…” implying Bible and Talmud as dual systems of Torah “she-bi-khtav” and “she-be-`al peh”, each with their own respective hierarchies of commentary and super-commentary). Theories of knowledge received much more attention and were published, but it was still not until Bass that a synthesis of areas of knowledge and bibliographic organization were systematically synthesized, and the bulk of Jewish literature therein arranged by title.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this sense, the \u003Cem>Sifte yeshenim\u003C/em> seems to spontaneously emerge. To be sure, Bass acknowledges the authors whose works he consulted. The closing section, entitled \u003Cem>Sha‘ar ha-ḥitsoni\u003C/em>, is a lengthy listing of the works consulted by Bass, nearly all of them the fruit of Christian Hebraism (Bass succinctly credits Hottinger and his \u003Cem>Promtuarium\u003C/em> [fol. 107a], “And here he records a great many books, placed in order according to subject.” Although Gessner is nowhere cited, Bass calls his class headings “sha`arim” (gates, portals). Some 35 year later, the \u003Cem>Sifte yeshenim\u003C/em> would serve as the foundation for the massive four volume_Bibliotheca hebraea_(Hamburg, 1715-1733) of Johann Christoph Wolf (1683-1739).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What prompted this sudden appearance? From the advent of Hebrew printing in the late 1460s up to the 1670s, technological, economic, and demographic changes had contributed to utterly change the culture of Jewish letters, of how books were produced and distributed. The printing press had made vast numbers of titles and copies available. With political upheavals and ecclesiastic censorship, older collections and their contents were brought back to light, often being redistributed into new collections. It can be argued that Jewish bibliophilia began during the 16th century, as both personal and communal collections developed. Bass arrived in Amsterdam to marvel at what can be said to be the first true Jewish Library, the Ets Haim Livraria Montezinos, founded in 1616. In a Borges-meets-Canetti kind of way: every library needs its catalogue, and every printer/monger, his inventory.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"moses-in-persia\">Moses in Persia\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Vera Moreen\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Moreen_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Judeo-Persian miniature paintings reflect traditional late and provincial styles of medieval Persian miniature paintings.

According to ancient legend Lilith, once banished from her initial relationship with Adam, swore vengeance against the offspring resulting from Adam and Eve’s union. The strange figures at the top of the amulet represent three angels Sanvei, Sansanvei, and Semenglof who were sent to warn Lilith that she and her cohort should not disturb any laboring mother if their own images were to be found there. This tale clearly emerges as a promotion for childbirth amulets and various practices arose in medieval through early modern Ashkenaz in which these angels names would be emblazoned upon the walls of laboring rooms.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Other amulets offering protection or grace appear in \u003Cem>Sefer Raziel ha-Mal’akh\u003C/em>, an anthology of mystical and magical, ancient and medieval fragments, first printed in Amsterdam 1701. The book originated in legendary form, in which the angel Raziel delivers a book to Adam after the latter’s expulsion from Eden. When Adam is lamenting his fate by the riverside, God dispatches Raziel with a book that will offer protection from the wilds of nature. At some point in medieval history various forms of this book began to take shape, with its contents remaining in flux until the printing in 1701. Because one of the ancient fragments in the book claims that the owner of the book will be protected from fire and other natural and supernatural ills, the printer exploited this detail, placing it on the book’s frontispiece resulting in the book enjoying considerable distribution and success as an amulet. Following the Six-Day War, miniaturized forms of the book circulated first among Israeli soldiers and subsequently in Sephardi and Haredi sectors of the Jewish community. Indeed, miniaturization has facilitated the development of yet a further legend—that the book should not be read at all!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"nahalat-tsvi-the-popular-yiddish-zohar\">Nahalat Tsvi: the Popular Yiddish Zohar\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Jean Baumgarten\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Baumgarten.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>From the 17th and the 18th centuries in Ahkenazi society, we observe a popularization of mysticism with the multiplication of ethical-kabbalistic texts.

The Christian printer Francesco Moücke successfully obtained an exclusive privilege (monopolio) to print and sell texts in Hebrew and Rashi typefaces in the whole State of Tuscany on December 1, 1734 from the Grand Duke Gian Gastone de’ Medici. Moücke is well known for his activity as a printer of art and literature works, and his connections to the intellectual Florentine milieu of the first half of the 18th century. He also happened to be the first to resume Hebrew printing in Tuscany, where practically no Hebrew books had appeared since 1658. The Grand Duke Peter Leopold of the Hapsburg-Lorraine house abolished the monopoly relative to Hebrew and Rashi printing in 1767, to promote the business of printing in the same spirit of free market economy that characterized other Livornese commercial activities. While Florence never became a center of Hebrew printing, in fact, the activity developed in Livorno from 1740: slowly and discontinuously at first, but with increasing success from the 1780s on. The Livornese Jewish government, on its part, attempted to regulate and discipline the activity of Hebrew printers more than the secular Tuscan authorities. The Sefer ha-Rashbash, printed by Abraham Meldola (Livorno 1742), provides the first example of the procedure that the Livornese Jewish government went through in order to approve a text for publication: 1) the Parnassim ordered the bet din to check the text and see if they found it publishable; 2) the appointed rabbis sent back their reply to the Parnassim and agreed to write an haskamah to the text; 3) the Parnassim approved it, giving permission to the printer to publish the work and to the rabbis of the community to write their haskamah. In the same year, Meldola petitioned the Grand Duke to command the Jewish government to “give up their pretensions” at controlling his activity, and allow him to print without the previous approval of the Parnassim. The Tuscan authorities granted his plea; however, subsequent Hebrew printers apparently kept submitting their books for approval and the practice was reintroduced.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"toldot-yaakov-yosef-koretz-1780\">\u003Cem>Toldot Ya’akov Yosef\u003C/em>, Koretz 1780\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Moshe Rosman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Rosman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>Generally regarded as the first Hasidic book, \u003Cem>Toldot Ya’akov Yosef\u003C/em> illustrates some of the features that typified Hasidic books. Common for these books, its genre was homiletics (\u003Cem>drash\u003C/em>), based on both the weekly Torah portion and the 613 commandments. While the origin of these \u003Cem>drashot\u003C/em> was probably oral lessons given in Yiddish by Rabbi Ya’akov Yosef of Polonne, one of the chief disciple-associates of Israel Ba’al Shem Tov (Besht), the founder of Hasidism, the book (like most early Hasidic books) was written in Hebrew. Rabbi Ya’akov Yosef is credited as author, however a printer’s note at the end of the book makes it clear that the book was compiled from various notes he had written. This and the problematic state of the text (the lack of proper introduction, material that appears to be out of order, repetitions, etc.) indicate that Rabbi Ya’akov Yosef, who was approaching his death at the time of publication, did not submit a publishable text to the printer. Rather it appears that his notes were edited by one or more of the publishers (\u003Cem>mevi’im le-veit ha-defus\u003C/em>): his son Avraham Shimshon of Rashkov, his son-in-law, Avraham Dov of Chmelnik, Shimon Ashkenazi and Shelomo Lutzker. In this way the editor or editors were actually coauthors of the text. This is usual with Hasidic books, where the named author rarely wrote a finished manuscript. Most of the time the published book appeared after the putative author’s death and represented his miscellaneous writings or oral teachings as recorded or later recalled by his associates. This raw material was then edited into a book after his death, its message shaped by the editors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the case of R. Ya’akov Yosef’s books (there were four in all) the publisher-editors apparently wanted to emphasize to potential readers that reading these books would enable them to learn not only the teachings of R. Ya’akov Yosef, but also of the Besht himself. In a long note on the verso of the title page they stressed the relationship between the Besht and R. Ya’akov Yosef. In the book itself they typographically highlighted all of the sayings that R. Ya’akov Yosef cited as his having heard directly from the Besht or in the holy man’s name, and at the end of the book they appended an additional series of Besht sayings that they found among R. Yaakov Yosef’s papers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pictured here is the first page of the text proper, after the introductory material or paratexts. Note how the traditions originating from the Besht begin with bold letters, five in all.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"american-rabbinic-imprints-1881-1939-the-paratext-as-social-history\">American Rabbinic Imprints, 1881-1939: The Paratext as Social History\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Menahem Blondheim\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200901155723im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Blondheim.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Cp>The two neat piles of seven Hebrew rabbinic books shown here differ greatly in girth; one is of tombs “fat in flesh,” the other of volumes “lean and ill-favored.” But these 14 books were in fact assorted into two groups by a non-material, if significant, attribute. While they all were published between 1900-1910—near the middle of this study’s time-frame— the set of larger ‘sphorim’ is a representative sample of books published in eastern Europe, the small set is representative of ‘sphorim’ published in America.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The striking change in the physique of traditional Hebrew rabbinical works upon the immigration of their authors to America, is only one in a series of novelties marking American rabbinic book culture. The unique features of Jewish American rabbinic books, my CAJS study suggests, can serve as a key to understanding broader social, cultural, and religious meanings of the encounter between America and traditional Jews and Judaism. It can also sharpen our understanding of the relationship between print and society generally.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The radically diminished size of the average rabbinic book in America serves to illustrate these broader concerns. A preliminary explanation would point to economic factors. And indeed, Hebrew publishing in America at the time cost roughly twice as much as in Eastern Europe, and a third more than in Palestine. But other explanations suggest themselves, and among them the seldom considered aspect of time-to-market is particularly revealing. American rabbis accumulated much less text than their European counterparts before going to the printer; and their manuscripts tended to represent more ephemeral rabbinic genres such as sermons, responsa, and polemics.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thus, there seems to have been a sense of urgency driving American authors to publish their rabbinic works. One aspect of it may have been personal: joining a chaotic assemblage of simpletons and scholars evacuating Europe, individual rabbis tried to establish their credentials and publicize their potential competence and authority to deal with the challenges of the new social and intellectual milieu as it was taking shape. They tried to introduce themselves to, and communicate with, their new peers by means of the printing press. Other features of American rabbinic works, such as authors publishing their ordinations in their books, and other telling paratexts to the same effect, underscore this dynamic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Moreover, American rabbis in their sermons and responsa, commentaries and polemics, were responding to the novel challenges America presented to traditional Judaism. Rabbis hurried with the recipes they proposed for religious survival to the print market, hoping to engage colleagues and public with their timely responses to the transformation of Jewish life in America.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Amnon Raz-Krokotzkin.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Tsenzurah ke-gorem me’atsev: ha-tsenzurah ha-Katolit veha-sifrut ha-`Ivrit ba-me`ah ha-16.\u003C/em> (Yerushalayim : ha-Universitah ha-‘Ivrit, 1989)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Avrin, Leila.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Scribes, Script and Books: The Book Arts from Antiquity to the Renaissance\u003C/em>.

What makes a definition authoritative? The modern dictionary (1) – its carefully derived etymologies (2), its hierarchically enumerated primary and secondary meanings, and its abundant literary citations of scattered historical usage – has been painstakingly compiled over the course of many centuries to respond to if not altogether answer these questions. What is known has been formatted with singular purpose and exquisite attention to detail. What is unknown or uncertain has been conscientiously omitted or else retained with a qualifying question mark. The end product of each lexical compilation, the dictionary entry, amounts to an encoded art form of presentation, concision and scholarly precision. The exact meaning of words has a book of its own: the dictionary.\n\nThis exhibit surveys a special field of dictionary-making called rabbinic lexicography (3). Rabbinic lexicography as a sub-species of dictionary-making refers to a roughly one thousand year-old corpus of literature that treats the Aramaic paraphrases of the Hebrew Bible known as Targum (4), as well as a sea of Jewish lore and legal expositions called Midrash (5) and Talmud (6). Rabbinic lexicography in a general sense can refer to successive generations of scholars, Jews and non-Jews, who have tried to understand and interpret the lexicon of post-Biblical Jewish learning. Their efforts have been complicated by the occurrence in rabbinic literature of a variety of unfamiliar loan words (e.g., from Greek, Latin, Persian, Arabic, and even Akkadian) and by the fact that Biblical and post-Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic writings were often copied without vowels (neḳudot) and accents (te’amim). Consequently, even one careless breath could alter the meaning of a sacred word. Over time, inconsistencies arose between written (ḳetiv) and spoken (ḳeri) reading traditions and among various textual witnesses; the uncertain meaning of exotic words also became increasingly problematic. To redress this situation, rabbinic scholars created new tools of exegesis (7).\n\nThe effort to extricate the words of rabbis from their literary contexts, re-arrange them alphabetically as discrete terms, define their meanings historically, and refine their modes of visual presentation evolved over many centuries. From targumic paraphrases and glossed rabbinic pages to the modern rabbinic dictionary entry, rabbinic lexicography has a complex history. It also forms a significant if often overlooked chapter in the general history of scholarship. As Solomon Schechter, a scholar of rabbinics, once put it: “dictionaries belong to that class of literature which is mostly studied but rarely quoted.”\n\n### Glossary\n\n(1) Dictionary. \u003C ad. med.

He grew up in a Yiddish-speaking family, in a German-speaking province, in what formerly had been part of the Kingdom of Poland before its three partitions between 1772 and 1795. Initially home-schooled in Hebrew and rabbinic studies, Jastrow graduated from a Prussian Gymnasium (high school) in the provincial capital of Posen in 1852. He then left for Berlin, the cosmopolitan center of Prussian culture, where he attended Berlin University while also being tutored in traditional rabbinics. Jastrow next pursued graduate studies at the University of Halle and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1855, at the age of twenty-six.  Two years later his rabbinical ordination (originally conferred in 1853 by Rabbi Moses Feilchenfeld), was confirmed and signed by Rabbi Wolf Landau, of Dresden. In 1858, on the eve of his thirtieth birthday, Jastrow moved to Warsaw to serve as a religious leader.\n\nNow living in Poland’s capital, Jastrow devoted himself to the mastery of the Polish language.  He also identified with and was active in the Polish independence movement. His involvement led to his arrest, imprisonment and eventual exile back to Prussia. In 1863, his decree of expulsion was revoked and Jastrow anticipated returning to his pulpit in Warsaw. With the outbreak of the Polish revolution that same year, however, his Prussian passport was abruptly canceled. Forced to earn a living elsewhere, Jastrow remained in Germany where he became the district rabbi of Worms. In 1866, at the age of thirty-seven, he accepted an invitation from Philadelphia to cross the Atlantic Ocean to become the officiating rabbi of that city’s Congregation Rodeph Shalom.\n\nJastrow introduced a new type of religious leadership and learning to America, one heavily influenced by the academic model of the German university, the spirit and methods of historical-critical inquiry, and the religious reform of Jewish theology and ritual observance. As David Werner Amram, a scholar of early Hebrew printing and friend, put it in a memorial address “[Jastrow’s] thought was a blend of Talmudism, classicism, and modernism.”  Jastrow’s arrival meant that familiarity with the best of European scholarship would now enter the mainstream of American Jewish cultural life. Indeed, Jastrow’s three major scholarly contributions – his English-Aramaic rabbinic dictionary, his role in the creation of the first English-language Jewish Encyclopedia, his contribution to the first Jewish critical translation into English of the Hebrew Bible – as well as the scholarship of his son Morris, all bear witness to this revolutionary cultural and intellectual transfer.\n\n### The Jastrow Dictionary\n\n![pj5205_j3_1886-tp.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/pj5205_j3_1886-tp.jpg)\n![Jastrow_02.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_02.jpg)\n\nMarcus Jastrow published the first edition of his dictionary in two volumes over the course of the last seventeen, illness-plagued years of his life.  A prefatory note dated July 1886 printed in the first volume details the plan for the complete future edition. But this single volume, covering only the first half of the Hebrew alphabet, was published, as is evident from the title page, in 1895. It may be the case that fascicles of the dictionary appeared prior to 1895 as installments of a work in progress. The complete two-volume set, however, would not appear until 1903, shortly before Jastrow’s death. In his preface to the 1903 edition, Jastrow acknowledged his scholarly debts, most notably to Jacob Levy, Alexander Kohut and to other major figures of 19th century German-Jewish scholarship. Unmentioned is the fact that the format of the Jastrow dictionary entry ultimately derives not from Jewish sources, however, but from a seventeenth-century Christian Hebraist lexicographer, Johannes Buxtorf.\n\n### Section 2\n\n![fig. 1: The second, “authorisited” \\[sic!\\], edition of the Jastrow dictionary was published in 1926 in one volume.

These efforts were by no means unprecedented. The Hebrew Bible itself contains traditions about the origins of specific Hebrew words and names. Early rabbinic literature—Mishnah, Tosefta, Gemarah, and Midrash—often employs etymological and grammatical interpretations of individual words as a means to achieve exegetical ends. For the Jews, the Hebrew consonants of the Bible embodied the fundamental elements of creation whose order—the Aleph-Bet (alphabet)—was designed by God. In the 7th century, a corpus devoted to the textual stabilization and authoritative transmission of the divine letters of the Hebrew Bible, the Masorah (from the Hebrew מסר, masar “to transmit, hand down”), began to appear. The Masoretes (the scholars who tried to determine the written text of the Hebrew Bible) intensively studied the formation and frequency of occurrence of the words of their received sacred writings. Jewish masoretic activity grew during the same period that Islamic scholars of Arabic and Christian scholars of Syriac (Christian Aramaic) began to investigate and classify their own respective languages. From the 7th-9th centuries, thus, the idea of the dictionary emerges as a systematic classification of the biblical lexicon into an organized inventory for consultation.\n\nDuring the time of the masoretes, two sects of Judaism were consolidating. Rabbanite Jews followed the text of the Bible (Torah she-bi-khtav, the written tradition) and recognized the authority of orally transmitted traditions of interpretation (Torah she-be-‘al peh) by rabbis whose teachings were eventually collected and written down in two different recensions of what was called Talmud. About 760 C.E., the heads of the Jewish Academies in Babylonia elected Hananiah ben David exilarch, the head of Babylonian diasporic Jewry. Hananiah, however, was second in the line of succession. His older brother Anan ben David, first in line, rebelled against the academies and the proponents of the Talmud, and delclared himself anti-exilarch. Anan rejected the legitimacy of the rabbanite traditions of interpretation and instead claimed the Bible, not the rabbis and their schools, as the authoritative voice of tradition. Anan’s followers were known as Karaites (from the Hebrew קרא ḳara —“ to call out or read,” i.e., the Bible). Both Karaites and Rabbanites believed in the sacred authority of the Hebrew Bible and both sects perpetuated the masoretic tradition. Rabbanites, however, possessed an additional, and immense, literary corpus repudiated by the Karaites. The Geonim (the heads of the rabbanite academies of Babylonia) Sa‘adiah ben Joseph al-Fayyumi (882-942), and Ḥai ben Sherira (939–1038) composed the first rabbinic lexicons in the 9th and 10th centuries. Much of the evidence for this period’s activity, some of which is on display here, is known today from the recovery of medieval texts stored—disposed of—in the attic of one synagogue in Fustat, the old city of Cairo. This remarkable storehold (genizah) of fragmentary documents is known as the Cairo Genizah.\n\n### Section 1\n\n![fig. 1: This Genizah fragment is from a commentary on a piyyut, or liturgical poem, in which thirteen difficult and rare words are used.

Its root (فسر F-S-R) IS the same as that of the Hebrew Pesher (פשר P-Š-R), which in the Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls refers to a short running commentary that also serves as an explanation. The tafsir in this fragment contains definitions of words and terms that rarely occur in the Mishnah, and therefore can only represent an early form of rabbinic lexicographic interpretation.](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/imag3.jpeg)\nfig. 3: The Jewish translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, or Targum, served dual purposes: they provided a relatively equivalent paraphrase of the text in the contemporary Jewish (non-Hebrew) vernacular, and they simultaneously explained and elucidated the meaning of the text to the common reader.

Rashi was a student of the head of the German academy in Mainz, Rabbenu Gershom (c. 960-1028). His commentaries to both the Bible and the Talmud remain as the fundamental key to the _peshat_, that is, “plain, basic meaning” of these texts.  Rashi’s contribution to rabbinic lexicography assumes the form of glosses, which include translations in old French (Rashi’s vernacular) of difficult and rare words throughout the Bible and Talmud. Rashi’s commentaries transmit the best known and most widely diffused of this glossary tradition. For the Bible, the masoretes  had already identified most of these rare and obscure words. Rashi, then and since the most important commentator, was one of a number of glossers active throughout France, Provence, Spain, and Italy to offer a traditional word-by-word translation and explanation of the biblical Hebrew text.\n\nIn 1102 Nathan ben Jehiel of Rome (1035-ca. 1110) completed his magnum opus, the _‘Arukh_ (“thesaurus”). From an ancient family of Roman Jewish scholars (Anaw), Nathan’s peregrinations would bring him to Sicily, Narbonne, Pavia, and Bari, and finally back to Rome before 1070.  Nathan was exposed to the last generation of Babylonian scholarship, the school of Cordoba, and Franco-Ashkenaz exegesis. The _‘Arukh_ would mark the most comprehensive lexicon of rabbinic Hebrew, encompassing the entire rabbinic literary corpus.  It has since stood as the rabbinic Hebrew dictionary _par excellence_:  not merely a dictionary, Nathan provides ample citations for his hundreds of sources, not an insignificant number of which are otherwise unknown.\n\nWhat Nathan did for the talmudic corpus, David Kimḥi (1160-ca. 1235) would do for the biblical corpus. The scion of the family, Joseph ben Isaac Kimḥi (1105-ca. 1170), a follower of Ibn Janah, was forced out Muslim Spain during the Almohades persecutions of 1146. Joseph settled in Narbonne, in Christian Provençe. Both he and his older son Moses (d. ca. 1190) defined the same system of verbal constructions and conjugations in use today. Joseph’s younger son David was raised under Moses’ mentorship. His grammar, the _Sefer Mikhlol_, a masterful reconciliation of the contrasting schools of Menaḥem and Dunash, became the definitive rabbinic grammar of biblical Hebrew. The second part of the _Mikhlol_ took its name from Ibn Janah’s dictionary: the _Sefer ha-Shorashim_, or “Book of Roots. ”\n\nEight books, at most, were produced by the first Hebrew printing press, active in Rome from ca. 1469-1472.  Among the six Hebrew imprints definitely produced in Rome at this time, were Rashi’s _Commentary to the Pentateuch_, Nathan ben Jehiel’s _‘Arukh_ , and the _Sefer ha-Shorashim_ by David Kimḥi.\n\n### The ‘Arukh of Nathan ben Jehiel\n\n![fig. 1:This fragment from the Cairo Genizah, shows the entries for אוב, אובא — _’uv, uva’ tamya’_—Hebrew and Aramaic terms found in the Bible, Targum and Gemara, which Jastrow translates into English as “ghost, necromancer”.

Censors would then examine the book for passages considered contradictory or offensive to Christianity, and obliterate them by pen stroke.  The censors of Hebrew books, some of whom were Jewish converts to Christianity, signed their names at the end of the book, stating that the they had thoroughly examined the work.\n### Section 3\n\n![fig. 1: This is one of the earliest known copies of Kimḥi’s “Dictionary of Roots”, copied in Spain in the last quarter of the 13th century.  The entry shown here is for the triliteral root עלם (_‘alam_).  Among its various constructions is the feminine noun form _‘almah_.  The word’s meaning is still among the most debated between Christians and Jews, and Kimḥi’s definition of _ha-‘almah_, citing Isaiah 7:13:  “Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: behold, _the young woman_ shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” This same “young woman”, however, was translated in Christian Bibles as “_virgin_”, and prefigured in the Old Testament as basis for the dogma of the virgin birth in the New Testament.  Kimḥi contended that this was a mistranslation, citing abundant examples elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible to demonstrate that the word _betulah_, not _‘alma_ is the term used for virgin.](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_21_01.jpg)\nfig. 1: This is one of the earliest known copies of Kimḥi’s “Dictionary of Roots”, copied in Spain in the last quarter of the 13th century.  The entry shown here is for the triliteral root עלם (_‘alam_).  Among its various constructions is the feminine noun form _‘almah_.  The word’s meaning is still among the most debated between Christians and Jews, and Kimḥi’s definition of _ha-‘almah_, citing Isaiah 7:13:  “Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: behold, _the young woman_ shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” This same “young woman”, however, was translated in Christian Bibles as “_virgin_”, and prefigured in the Old Testament as basis for the dogma of the virgin birth in the New Testament.  Kimḥi contended that this was a mistranslation, citing abundant examples elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible to demonstrate that the word _betulah_, not _‘alma_ is the term used for virgin.\n\n### Section 4\n\n![fig. 1: Soon after the Rome Hebrew printing press began in Rome, other Hebrew presses were established in Reggio di Calabria, Piove di Sacco, Mantua, and possibly Spain.  No part of the Hebrew Bible was printed until 1477.  This Hebrew Psalter, probably printed in Bologna, with David Kimḥi’s commentary, is the first printed edition of any section of the Bible.  Kimḥi’s commentary, arranged interlinearly, is set off from the biblical text by the size and style of the typeface.

It was first introduced into Hebrew printing in Ferrara, in Abraham ben Hayim’s May 1477 first edition of Job with commentary by Gersonides. The frame format quickly became associated with Hebrew printing, although it was probably borrowed from the format used in Christian manuscripts of the Latin Bible accompanied by the two commentaries called the Glossa ordinaria (“arranged commentaries”).\n\nNumerous presses were active in this period prior to the Spanish Expulsion, and extended throughout the Italian and the Iberian peninsulas. Hebrew printing flourished from 1486 until 1492 in Naples, then under Spanish Catholic rule, where two Jewish families of printers, the Soncinos and the Gunzenhausers, both of German origin, competed with each other.\n\n### Section 6 \n\n![fig. 1:The polyglot, or “multi-language” Bible allowed Christian scholars to compare scriptures  in their traditional languages.

Printing brings with it new ways of producing, diffusing, and reading information. Hebrew printing begins in Italy about 1469, about fourteen years after Gutenberg’s fourty-two line Bible, printed in Mainz.   If Obadiah, Menasseh, and Benjamin of Rome based their choices of titles along notions of supply and demand, then their production of both Kimḥi’s _Sefer ha-Shorashim_ and Nathan ben Jehiel’s _‘Arukh_ may tell us something of the importance of these works, and the position of and interest in rabbinic lexicography at that time.\n\nPrinting allowed for an increase in new lexicographic works, from the mundane _Makre dardeke_ (Naples, 1488), a dictionary of biblical Hebrew modeled after the _Shorashim,_ replete with citations as well as Judeo-Italian and Judeo-Arabic glosses provided for the youngest of students, to Elijah Levita’s _Masoret ha-masoret_ (Venice: Bomberg, 1538), the monumental achievement of masoretic activity.   Printing also shows how Jewish demography, as well as lexicographic activity, was shifting:   from the Iberian and Italian penisulas to the Venetian Republic, Constantinople, Basel, Prague, Amsterdam. Despite the turmoils, segregations, and caprices of tolleration to which Jews were subject, amidst Reformation and Counter-reformation, new Jewish works on rabbinic lexicography emerged.\n![25Key.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/25Key.jpg)\n### Section 1\n![fig. 1: This is Daniel Bomberg’s famous second edition of the _Mikraot gedolot,_ the Great _Rabbinic_ Bible.

Through its inclusion of the Hebrew text, the Aramaic Targum, and multiple commentaries, all conveniently arranged around the centrality (physically as well as doctrinally) of the Hebrew original text.\n\nThe authority of this edition is due in large part to the revision of Tunisian Jacob ben Hayim ibn Adonijah (ca. 1470-ca. 1538) of the 1517 edition. This new edition was thoroughly recorrected and vastly more complete than the 1517.   However, David Kimḥi’s commentary on Psalms, which appeared in the 1517 edition, is notably absent, replaced by those of Rashi and Abraham ibn Ezra.   By 1524 Kimḥi’s commentary was perceived as blatantly anti-Christian, and therefore too controversial to print.\n### Section 2\n![fig. 1: Early Hebrew printing formatted the fruits of medieval rabbinic lexicography.

What Bomberg did for the Hebrew Bible, he also achieved for the Talmud.  He printed the first complete edition of the Babylonian Talmud (1520-1522), as well as the _editio princeps_ (the absolute first printed edition) of the Jerusalem Talmud (1526). This complete version won such favor among its Jewish readership that its pagination became standardized, and is nearly identical with the editions in use today.\n### Section 3\n\nElijah Levita (1468 or 9-1549, also known as Elijah Bahur) is regarded as the single most important Jewish grammarian of his time.  This reputation could have rested alone on his exhaustive Masoretic works and activity with Daniel Bomberg’s press.  In 1509 he was living in Padua, but warfare drove him and his family from the city. Taking refuge in Rome, Levita and his family were hosted by Aegidius of Viterbo, Cardinal and general of the Augustine order, in exchange for Hebrew lessons.  He was admired by Jews and Christians alike: King Francis I offered Levita the position of professor of Hebrew at the University of Paris, which he declined, being unwilling to settle in a city forbidden to his coreligionists. He declined also invitations from several cardinals, bishops, and princes to accept a Hebrew professorship in Christian colleges.\n\n![fig. 1: Levita’s _Sefer meturgeman_ is the first dictionary dedicated to the Aramaic of the Targum.](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_27_01.jpg)\n![fig. 2: Levita’s _Sefer meturgeman_ is the first dictionary dedicated to the Aramaic of the Targum.](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_27_02.jpg)\nfig. 1 & 2: Levita’s _Sefer meturgeman_ is the first dictionary dedicated to the Aramaic of the Targum.\n![fig. 3: The _Sefer ha-Tishbi,_ based on the _‘Arukh,_ was first published in 1541 in Isny, in collaboration with the German scholar and printer Paul Fagius.

His dictionary focuses on the terminology used in the narrative and non-legal portions of the Talmud known as _Aggadah_ (“narration”). The first two editions, on display here, were printed, respectively, in Constantinople 1552, and Prague 1663.   Jewish cultural activities, including lexicography and printing, were profoundly affected by the events—expulsions, ghetto, Inquisition—of the 16th century, and follow the same paths of migration and shift.\n\n### Section 5\n![Jastrow_29.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_29.jpg)\n\nDe Pomis (1525-ca. 1593), a native of Umbria, was a member of the same Anaw family as Nathan ben Jehiel.

All were ultimately dependent on the _‘Arukh_ of Nathan ben Jehiel and the _Shorashim_ of Kimḥi.\n### Section 1\n![](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_31a_01.jpg)\n![](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_31a_02.jpg)\nJewish Hebrew speakers remaining in Spain after the Expulsion, Ximénez comissioned several Jewish converts to Christianity to translate the Hebrew Bible into Latin and assist in the editing of the Hebrew text.  Among these were: Alfonso, son of Juan de Zamora, baptized in 1506 and professor of Hebrew at Salamanca; Paul Nuñez Coronel (d. 1534), originally instructed for the rabbinate, baptized prior to1492, and also professor of Hebrew at the University of Salamanca; Diego López de Zúñiga (d. 1530). In addition to his work as translator and editor, Alfonso compiled this alphabetically arranged Hebrew-Latin dictionary, appended as volume 6 to the polyglot.\n### Section 2\n![](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/stephanus_grammar1548.jpg)\n![](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_32_new.jpg)\nPagnini, whose initial formation began under the tutelage of Girolamo Savonarola in Florence, is an emblematic figure of Renaissance Christian Hebraism in Italy. His commentaries, grammars and translations were hailed by Christians and Jews alike, and his erudition.  His industry so impressed Pope Leo X that he assumed the expenses of Pagnini's _Veteris et__Novi Testamenti nova translatio_ (Lyons, 1527). The _Thesaurus linguae sanctae_ is Pagnini's translation of and exposition on Kimḥi’s _Sefer ha-shorashim_.\n### Section 3\n![](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_36.jpg)\n![](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_36_01.jpg)\n![](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_35_01.jpg)\nThe collaboration of Sebastian Münster and Johann Froben left a permanent mark on Christian Hebraism, transplanting its center to Basel.  Born in Germany, Münster studied with Elijah Levita and translated his works into Latin, adding to the fame and reputation of the Venetian Levita.  Johann Froben’s family, proprietors of the press at the University of Basel had begun printing in Hebrew in 1516, in a beautiful and characteristic Ashkenazic typface. On display are Münster’s translation of Kimhi’s Shorashim and Nathan ben Jehiel’s ‘Arukh. By the time of their printings, and in part thanks to Münster and Froben, these works became  canonical to the practice of rabbinic lexicography by Christian Hebraists.\n### Section 4\nPhilippe d'Aquin was born Mardochée Cresque in the city of Carpentras in southern France.  His family had long resided in the Comtat Venaissin, where Jews had been permitted to settle from the time of the Avignon Papacy.  While in the central Italian city of Aquino—the native city of Thomas Aquinus—he converted to Christianity and assumed the name Philippe. In 1610 he went to Paris, where he was appointed professor of Hebrew by Louis XIII.  Among other works, he published both Latin and Italian translations of Pirke Avot, a treatise on Hebrew roots (_Primigenae Voces, seu Radices Breves Linguae Sanctae_) , and participated in the production of the Paris _Biblia poliglotta_ (1629-1645), the “Third Great Polyglot”, a French endeavor to update Plantin’s polyglot Bible (Antwerp, 1575, the “Second Great Polyglot”, successor to Completensian Bible.\n![Fig. 1: The _Ma’arikh ha-Ma’arekhot_ (“Dictionary of Dictionaries” a play on the title _‘Arukh_) was issued in Paris in 1629, and is another Latin translation of Nathan ben Jehiel’s chief work.](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_35.jpg)\nFig. 1: The _Ma’arikh ha-Ma’arekhot_ (“Dictionary of Dictionaries” a play on the title _‘Arukh_) was issued in Paris in 1629, and is another Latin translation of Nathan ben Jehiel’s chief work.\n### Section 5\n![](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_38_01.jpg)\nJohann Buxtorf, considered the principal founder of rabbinical study among Christian scholars, was born Christmas day, 1564, at Kamen, Westphalia. He studied at Marburg and afterward at Herborn, where Johann Piscator persuaded him to study Hebrew. He continued his studies at Basel in 1584 and graduated as doctor of philosophy in 1590.  The following year he was appointed professor of Hebrew at the University of Basel, a position he continued to fill until his death there on September 13, 1629.  Buxtorf's work as a lexicographer began with the _Epitome Radicum Hebraicarum et Chaldaicarum_ (Basel, 1607), afterward published in numerous. As especially important was his _Concordance_, based upon the older work of Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus (14th-15th century) and published after Buxtorf’s death by his son, Johann Buxtorf the younger (Basel, 1599-1664). Buxtorf began work on his _Lexicon chaldaicum, talmudicum et rabbinicum_ in 1609; it was also completed by his son in 1639, after nine years of indefatigable labor. This lexicon became an indispensable guide to specialists, and was published as late as 1866.\n\n## Specialized Christian Hebraist Rabbinic Lexicons\n \nChristian Hebraic activity extended to all areas of Jewish learning, and developed, sometimes in tandem with Jewish authors, new approaches to analyzing and working with rabbinic literature.  Some of the great efforts are in the nascent period of comparative philology.  Assessing the lexicon of the Talmud, scholars realize that many of the words in rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic derive from other languages, such as Greek, Latin, and Persian, and derive from earlier contacts between Jewish and non-Jewish cultures.  Early comparative Semitic dictionaries are another development, in which Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic are identified as members of a larger family of languages.\n\nThe expansion of the polyglot Bible, culminating in England in 1657 with the publication of Bryan Walton’s nine-language edition, spawns the development of multi-lingual dictionaries, concentrating less on the genealogy of words, but more on their cross-cultural usage.  Finally, aids such as dictionaries of abbreviations and guides to Hebrew letter writing are developed as aids for the Christian scholar working in the field of rabbinic literature.\n### Section 1\n![](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_40.jpg)\nJust as Buxtorf’s _Bibliotheca Rabbinica_—containing about 324 rabbinical writings arranged according to the Hebrew alphabet—was the first serious endeavor toward a compilation of a Jewish bibliography, so the _De Abbreviaturis Hebraicis_ furnished the basis for a knowledge of Hebrew rabbinic abbreviations.\n### Section 2\n![Fig. 1: David Cohen de Lara (ca. 1600-1674), was _Haham_ (chief Rabbi), of the Sefardic Hamburg Jewish Community, as well as lexicographer.

As Wolf himself points out in his footnote, the work had been taken from a history of Hebrew lexicons that he had submitted for his doctoral dissertation (_Rath Sifrai Shirshaim, sive Historia lexicorum Hebraicorum_, Wittenberg: 1705).\n### Section 4\n![](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/buxtorf-1-comp.jpg)\nBuxtorf's Institutio Epistolaris Hebraica, although not a dictionary per se, was printed to guide Christian Hebraists in the then contemporary rabbinic epistolary styles. The work contains over one hundred letters, partly supplied with vowels, translations into Latin, and furnished with explanations of select words. Many letters were taken from the earlier epistolary guides, such as the Megillat Sefer (Venice, 1552), Iggarot Shelomim (Augsburg, 1603), and the Ma‘ayan Ganim (Venice, 1553).  However, some of the letters reflect Buxtorf’s own correspondence with rabbis of his time.\n\n## Early Modern Jewish Rabbinic Lexicography\nJews of the 17th and 18th centuries were generally less active in the field of lexicography.  The authority of the _‘Arukh_ and the _Shorashim_ had undergone a kind of canonization, due to their comprehensiveness and availability.  Furthermore, it was not easy to propose new works:  new endeavors encountered the dual problems of commercial demand and the obstacle of civil, Christian, and Jewish censorship. Therefore, what one rabbinic court approved in Italy, others elsewhere in Europe or North Africa might very well reject, and with rejection, the disinterest of the publisher.\n\nNonetheless, some innovations did appear. Jews such as David Cohen de Lara and Benjamin Mussafia began examining non-Jewish components of the rabbinic lexicon, and new types of reference works were developed, among them talmudic encyclopedias, the first Hebrew thesaurus, catalogues of Jewish literature, and biobibliographic listings of Jewish authors and their works. Most of these, however, were printed in Amsterdam, Hamburg, and Livorno, the western European cities where Jews and their activities were least restricted.\n### Section 1\n![](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_47_01.jpg)\nMussafia may have been a _converso_, a Christian of Jewish origin who left Spain and returned to his Jewish heritage.  Little is known about his origin:  he may have been born in Spain around 1606, and in his Latin works went by the name _Dionysius_. He was Physician in ordinary to King Christian IV of Denmark until the latter’s death in 1648.  Mussafia then went to Amsterdam, where he became a member of the college of rabbis, until his death in 1675. In his new edition of the _‘Arukh_, he explains the Greek and Latin words and also contributed much to the knowledge of the customs and conditions of Jewish life. In the preface to this work, he states that he had been collecting his material since his early youth. Many of these additions to the _‘Arukh_, based on the lexicon of Buxtorf, although they contain much original matter, have been retained as a component part of the later editions, and are specially indicated by Kohut in his _Aruch Completum_.\n### Section 2\n![Fig. 1:The Physician and Rabbi Isaac Lampronti (Ferrara, 1679-1756) spent much of his life compiling this encyclopedia to the Talmud and talmudic literature.

He served as Chief Rabbi of Minsk from 1711 until his death. On display is his dictionary, the first Hebrew thesaurus, containing synonyms and antonyms as they occur throughout the Bible, Talmud, and other rabbinic and mystical works.\n\n## Rabbinic Lexicography & Wissenschaft des Judentums\nThe 19th century introduced revolutionary new approaches to the scientific study of the Jewish past.  Rabbinic lexicography was a key area of research profoundly affected by new methods of comparative linguistic analysis and by controversial efforts to differentiate the chronological strata of religious literature. The general spirit of the age was reflected in the founding in Berlin in 1819 of a Society (_Verein_) to promote what would come to be known as the _Wissenschaft des Judentums_ (“Science of Judaism”).  In the first and only volume of the Society’s journal, the programmatic study of Judaism proclaimed there is animated by a clear desire to belong to the mainstream of modern research; new historical criteria would be required for the study and evaluation of the history and literature of the Jews; new periodizations would be introduced to delineate the way the Jewish experience changed over time. Despite its apologetic impulses and practical communal concerns, the goal of the movement was to create an objective, scientific understanding of the Jewish past on par with the non-Jewish histories that characterized their time. This new science of Judaism rapidly spread across Europe and entered the curricula of institutions of higher Jewish learning like the _Jüdisch-Theologisches Seminar,_ established in Breslau in 1854.  Many of the leading contributers to this generation of rabbinic lexicography were trained at Breslau , or at other new types of rabbinical seminaries and German universities.\n### Section 1\nZunz, widely acclaimed as one of the founding figures of the _Wissenschaft des Judentums,_ served as editor of its first journal, _Zeitschrift für die Wissenschaft des Judentums,_ started in Berlin in 1822. Zunz’s historical studies of the language and customs of the Jewish religion are credited by Marcus Jastrow in the preface to his dictionary as being one of the important Jewish scholarly resources he drew upon in the course of his lexicographical labors.\n![](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_53.jpg)\n\n### Section 2\nIn the same year that the Society for Culture and Science of the Jews was established in Berlin , the printer and lexicographer Moses Landau began publishing his rabbinic dictionary in Prague. Landau served as the head of the Prague Jewish community and was well-versed in secular German as well as rabbinical literature. Though its Hebrew title echoes the Jewish lexicographical traditions of Nathan and Mussafia, Landau’s “Wörterbuch” clearly is imbued with the historical spirit of his own time and in fact was criticized by traditional rabbis for its innovations. Notably, Berlin includes German translations of rabbinic terms and examines topics and evidence from philology, archaeology, nature and art.   The difficult and self-conscious nature of the undertaking, which took sixteen years to complete, is evident from a rhymed poem found at the beginning of Part Three that begs the reader’s forbearance for the slow pace of the dictionary’s completion.\n![Jastrow_54_02.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_54_02.jpg)\n![Jastrow_54_01thumb.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_54_01thumb.jpg)\n### Section 3\n![Fig. 1: Abraham Geiger was among the most outspoken and controversial leaders of the nineteenth-century Jewish reform movement.

Geiger believed that rabbinic Hebrew literature, far from reflecting a daily vernacular, bore witness to an artificial construct of “Hebraized Aramaic” employed by rabbis to cohere the Jews as a people and to counter the threat of linguistic assimilation.   Subsequently, Geiger’s critics, such as M.H. Segal, determined continuities between Biblical and early rabbinic Hebrew.

Rapoport authored a lengthy biography of Nathan Ben Yehiel, including a study of his _‘Arukh_ against the background of medieval rabbinic lexicography. He also tried to produce what he called an _“opus encyclopedium”_ of Talmudic terms that (like Isaiah ben Judah Loeb Berlin’s dictionary) steered a critical course between the historical dimensions of the Talmud and reverence for the authority and sanctity of rabbinic tradition.   This autograph copy is presented to “Dr. Marcus Jost,” who like Geiger and others with whom Rapoport fiercely contended , was a reform-minded historian. Rapoport only was able to publish this first volume, covering the letter aleph (a) during his lifetime. A posthumously published two-volume second edition that appeared in Warsaw in 1914 incorporated many of his otherwise disparately published lexicographical studies.\n### Section 5\n![img3_3.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img3_3.jpg)\n![img4_3.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img4_3.jpg)\nJoseph Schönhak’s Aramaic-Rabbinic-German dictionary also illustrates the mixed sensibilities of tradition and change characteristic of many Jews living in Central and Eastern Europe during the nineteenth century. This “New _‘Arukh,_” as it is called in Hebrew, provides a commentary in German written in Hebrew characters, thus limiting its access to presumably enlightened Hebrew readers. The format essentially follows that laid down by Johannes Buxtorf, though the ordering of entries follows the traditional arrangement of the previously printed editions of the _'Arukh_.\n\n### Section 6\n![img5_3.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img5_3.jpg)\n![img6_3.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img6_3.jpg)\nWilhelm Bacher, who received his doctorate from the University of Leipzig and his rabbinical degree from the Seminary in Breslau , was a scholar of rabbinic hermeneutics and the leading scholar of his time of Judeo-Persian literature. Bacher introduced his relatively arcane research to English readers via _The Jewish Encyclopedia._ Published there, for example, is an article by Bacher on Tanhum ben Joseph Yerushalmi, a virtually unknown thirteenth-century Jewish exegete who lived in Egypt, wrote in Judeo-Arabic, knew Greek, studied natural sciences, medicine and mathematics, and belonged to the rationalist camp of medieval Jewish philosophy. Bacher based the article in part on his critical study of the original text of Tanhum’s dictionary (until then known only in manuscript) entitled _“Al-Murshid al-Kafi.”_ This lexicon, whose cited sources include the _‘Arukh_ of Nathan ben Yehiel, as well as the works of Saadia, Ibn Janah, Dunash and others, provides alphabetized etymologies and meanings of the rabbinic Hebrew of the Mishnah and of the Mishneh Torah (a codification of post-Biblical Jewish law by Maimonides, the leader of Egyptian Jewry during the latter part of the twelfth-century).\n\n## Specialized Rabbinic Dictionaries\nDuring the 19th century, scholars systematically extracted from the rabbinic corpus “loan” words from Arabic, Greek, Latin and Persian and presented them separately in dictionaries of their own. These specialized dictionaries reflected new advances in the critical study of rabbinic literature and addressed a practical need to better understand obscure words and concepts.   Specialized lexicons also were produced to help students decipher mysterious forms of rabbinic abbreviations.   Acronyms and initials (_rashe tevot_), acrostics (_notarikonim_) and elided spellings (_kitsurim_) severely handicapped inexperienced readers.   For those seeking entrée into this closed world, as well as for those with advanced training, abbreviations posed special difficulties because a single abbreviation could refer to a multitude of possible meanings.   The abbreviation “a-b-a” (aleph-bet-aleph), for example, potentially can refer to 1) the word for “father”; 2) a genealogical relationship (“his sister, daughter of his father”); 3) any of a variety of rabbinic personalities quoted in the literature; 4) an indication of an alternative explanation; 5) “literally”; etc.. In addition to dictionaries of abbreviations, specialized subject dictionaries of legal, philosophical scientific and medical terms as well as dictionaries of pseudonyms and bio-bibliographies also were published.   The field of rabbinic lexicography, in short, developed its own polyglot sub-specializations, both as a consequence of new critical-historical research and in response to the needs of the time.\n### Section 1\n![img1.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img1.jpg)\n\nAdolph Jellinek, the renowned preacher and scholar, served as rabbi at Leipzig from 1845 to 1856 and at Vienna from 1857 until his death there in 1893.   His famous six-volume compilation of obscure midrashic works entitled “Bet ha-Midrash (vols. 1-4 in Leipzig, 1853-57; vols. 5-6 in Vienna, 1873-77) spans his career in both these cities.   Jellinek, lenient towards ritual observance and liberal in his politics, also took a keen interest in Jewish mystical literature at a time when scholars of his generation embraced a rational picture of Judaism and spurned the Kabbalah as superstitious nonsense. Less well known is Jellinek’s important lexicographical study entitled _Sefat hakhamim,_ published in Leipzig in 1844. It is the first published glossary of Persian loan words in rabbinic literature.\n\n### Section 2\n![Fig. 1: In the preface to his dictionary, Marcus Jastrow commented that Samuel Krauss’s “_Griechische und lateinische Lehnworter_,” for all its merits, suffered from the author’s “proclivity to find Latin and Greek in words indisputably Semitic” thus leading him into a “labyrinth of fatal errors.” Krauss, who studied at the _Hochschule fuer die Wisssenschaft des Judentums_ in Berlin and received his Ph.D. from the University of Giessen in Germany, nonetheless was the first to treat in depth over three thousand words found in rabbinic literature which he considered to be of Greek and Latin origin.

Its author, Aaron Masie, was born near the town of Moghilev in White Russia, was orphaned at the age of five, attended the elite Mir yeshiva at the age of sixteen, then turned to socialism and later became a physician. Masie supported the Jewish nationalist movement and moved to Palestine where he became a member of the “Committee for the Expansion of the Hebrew Language” [_Va’ad ha-lashon_], forerunner of the Israeli Academy of Hebrew Languages.   Notably, Masie advised Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, the “father” of the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language, on the creation of a modern Hebrew medical and scientific vocabulary. Masie reserved Latin for technical terms and English for popular usage as equivalents to these newly fashioned Hebrew words. Curiously, Masie’s dictionary is arranged not according to the Hebrew but the Latin alphabet. After forty years of work, Masie died in 1930 before he could finish the project. His manuscript and source material was edited and published posthumously four years later by the poet and physician Saul Tchernichowsky, along with a preface by the Hebrew poet Hayim Nahman Bialik and a biographical sketch of Masie by the historian Nahum Slouschz.\n![img6.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img6.jpg)\n![img7.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img7.jpg)\n![img8.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img8.jpg)\n\n## Advent of Modern Rabbinic Lexicography\nThe modern Rabbinic dictionary that came into existence towards the end of the nineteenth century emerged in the context of profound reevaluations of the authority of revealed traditions, the historicity of written documents, and the nature of orally transmitted beliefs. What had once been taken to be eternal and unchanging was now shown to have evolved over time. Ancient languages, such as Ugaritic and Akkadian were being discovered and deciphered while stupendous new archeological discoveries were changing the face of the historical past.   To further complicate matters, Jews were engaged in the greatest population movement in their entire history as they migrated from Central and Eastern Europe to North America and Palestine.\n\nIn the face of these modern upheavals, one seemingly unremarkable element of rabbinic lexicography quietly remained virtually unchanged. Not unlike the way the formatted page of the rabbinic Bible and the Talmud in the 16th century was patterned on Christian scholastic glossed texts, modern Jewish rabbinic lexicographers continued to replicate the format of the dictionary entry popularized by the Christian Hebraist lexicographer Johannes Buxtorf, the Elder. This is especially evident in the formatting of Jacob Levy’s rabbinic dictionary, considered the first modern critical work of its kind. From Buxtorf to Jacob Levy to Alexander Kohut to Marcus Jastrow to Barukh Krupnik, continuity of form, if not content, persisted.   Those who adopted a scientific approach to the study of religious texts, no matter where that path might take them, often invested their methods with a new kind of rational conviction.   Consequently, the task of the rabbinic lexicographer (secular or devout, Jewish or Christian), like the format of the lexical entry itself, would in some sense remain the same: to establish the authentic meaning of the most sacred words on the most secure grounds and in the most stable way possible\n### Section 1\n![img1_0.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img1_0.jpg)\n![img2_0.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img2_0.jpg)\n![img3_0.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img3_0.jpg)\n![img4_0.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img4_0.jpg)\nJacob Levy is widely regarded as the founder of modern critical rabbinic lexicography and his dictionary had a tremendous influence on subsequent scholarship. In particular, Levy is credited with promoting the importance of the study of Syriac for determining the correct reading and/or etymology of a given word — probably relying, as Michael Sokoloff surmises, on the _Lexicon heptaglotton_ of Edmund Castell. His format, however, is clearly patterned after that of Buxtorf's Lexicon chaldaicum.  Levy’s dictionary was published in at least two distinct editions, under two different titles. The first edition, _Chaldäisches Wörterbuch über die Targumim,_ was published in Leipzig (1867-1868).  Levy’s _“Neuhebräisches und chaldäisches Wörterbuch über die Talmudim und Midraschim”_ was published in Leipzig (1876-1889) and was accompanied by the notes and corrections of Heinrich Fleischer.   The Berlin and Vienna edition of 1924, entitled  _“Wörterbuch über die Talmudim und Midraschim,”_ was significantly revised by Lazarus Goldschmidt. This edition became the standard “Levy” dictionary subsequently consulted by scholars.\n### Section 2\n![img5_4.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img5_4.jpg)\n![kohut-comp.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/kohut-comp.jpg)\nThe Hungarian-born Alexander Kohut, whose career spanned two oceans and at least two generations of scholarship, was a pivotal figure in the modern history of rabbinic lexicography. Kohut studied at the Breslau Seminary and at the University of Leipzig , where he received a thorough grounding in Greek, Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persian and Semitic languages as well as his doctorate. By his own account, Kohut was thirteen years old when he first set out to thoroughly revise the ‘Arukh of Nathan ben Yehiel after he was unable to find what he was looking for in Moses Landau’s revised edition of it.   Subsequently, Kohut started correcting and/or expanding Nathan’s entries and quotations from rabbinic literature and the project eventually turned into a systematic revision of all the subsequent scholarship.   Notably, Kohut made use of previously uncited sources and new critical tools, such as the variant readings of rabbinic texts compiled in Raphael Rabinowitz’s cumbersome _Dikduke Soferim._  Kohut completed his scholarly efforts in the United States after moving from his post as rabbi of Nagyvard (German: Grosswardein, in Hungary ), to New York City in May of 1885 and died there in 1894.\n### Section 3\n![img8_0.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img8_0.jpg)\nJastrow’s dictionary, while generally well-received, also endured a fair amount of criticism.   Recent scholarship has faulted Jastrow for lumping together all Hebrew and Aramaic vocabulary under one cover and for not taking into account the different times and places when and where each was used. At the time of its publication, some critics also took issue with new etymologies Jastrow proposed for various words. In at least one area, however, Jastrow certainly could not be faulted for adopting a radical new approach.   The visual presentation of the Jastrow dictionary entries did not depart from the traditional format transmitted from Johannes Buxtorf to Jacob Levy to Alexander Kohut to himself.\n### Section 4\n![img9.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img9.jpg)\n![img10.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img10.jpg)\nPaula Arnold-Kellner is the first woman to have published a dictionary under her own name which explicity includes “words of Talmudic origin” .  Arnold was born and raised in Vienna, was a skilled linguist and translator, and eventually moved to British mandate Palestine in 1933 at the age of forty-eight, where she continued to write and translate.   This Hebrew-English dictionary (it does not include an English-Hebrew component), written with Moses David Gross, also contains a supplementary list of abbreviations.\n### Section 5\nBarukh Karu (Krupnik) was born in Podolia (Ukraine), worked as a journalist, editor, translator and lexicographer, before migrating to Palestine. His practical dictionary of rabbinic literature, written with the scholar and translator A. M. Silberman, was published in London in two volumes in 1927.   Its entries are alphabetically arranged for easy use. Its format clearly follows the pattern established by Johannes Buxtorf and subsequently adopted by Jewish rabbinic lexicographers from Jacob Levy to Marcus Jastrow.\n![img11.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img11.jpg)\n![img12.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img12.jpg)\n\n## Modern Hebrew and Yiddish Rabbinic Lexicography\nThe absorption of classical and medieval rabbinic language, concepts, and terms by modern, spoken Hebrew and Yiddish meant that modern “Hebrew” and “Yiddish” dictionaries also had to take into account the extensive rabbinic Aramaic heritage present in living Jewish languages. For Eliezer ben-Yehudah, credited with reviving Hebrew as a spoken language, foreign words and languages, ancient or European, needed to be purged from the Hebrew vernacular before a new, national Jewish language could be born. Consequently, Ben-Yehuda deliberately omitted many Aramaic and other “foreign” words from his modern Hebrew dictionary and invented many neologisms of his own. At the same time, the Committee for the Expansion of the Hebrew Language that he founded had to take into account the autonomous character of Hebrew as a living language. Newly minted words in the language laboratory were not always accepted by Hebrew speakers. The Zionist notion of the “negation of the diaspora” (_shelilat ha-galut_)—associated with the concept of the ingathering of the Jewish people to their national homeland from their foreign places of residence—also expressed itself through the politicization of language. Yiddish, a language born in the diaspora and spoken by the majority of world Jewry, was perceived by Ben-Yehuda and others as a threat to the revival of Hebrew.  At the tumultuous Yiddish Language Conference held in Czernowitz in 1908 Yiddishists, reacting against the nationalization of Hebrew, rejected Hebrew as a dead language reserved for prayer and declared Yiddish to be a truly national living Jewish language.\nThis controversial relationship between Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people and Yiddish as the spoken mother tongue of the largest Jewish population centers outside the Land of Israel , persisted.  The politics of language began to soften only decades after the founding of the state of Israel when “diaspora” languages like Yiddish, once banned from the Israeli classroom, received renewed popular and academic interest.  But throughout this time, Yiddishisms had already found their way into modern spoken Hebrew. Hebraisms meanwhile always had existed in Yiddish.  Dictionaries of both bore unmistakable traces of the classical rabbinic Aramaic lexicon.\n### Section 1\n![Fig. 1: The Lithuanian-born Perelman became a passionate Zionist and more than anyone else is credited with reviving Hebrew as a spoken language in the Land of Israel.

As a modern Yiddish lexicographer, Harkavy, not unlike what Ben-Yehuda did for the Hebrew language, helped pioneer the rebirth of Yiddish as a literary language and defended its status against those who regarded it as an unseemly “zhargon.” He established the first Yiddish newspaper in Canada (_Di Tsayt_), founded other Yiddish periodicals, and published a large volume of practical handbooks, translations of European literature into Yiddish, literary criticism as well as scholarly articles.  This second, revised edition (first edition, 1891) of Harkavy’s dictionary is bi-lingual (English to Yiddish only).  Each English word is vocalized in the Hebrew alphabet for the practical use of the Yiddish speakers trying to learn English.  At the end of the work are lists of personal names, place names, and foreign terms, arranged alphabetically in English to Yiddish (from left to right on the page).  Purists of the Yiddish language criticized Harkavy for introducing too many words of modern German, rather than of traditional Yiddish origin, as well as popular Anglicized Yiddish vocabulary, such as ‘vindo’ (window).\n### Section 3\n![img10_0.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img10_0.jpg)\n![img11_0.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img11_0.jpg)\nThe Russian-born Spivak, a physician and writer, and the Lithuanian-born Bloomgarden, one of the major translators of European literature into Yiddish, collaborated in the United States to produce a Yiddish dictionary that paid special attention to the occurrence of Biblical and rabbinic terms in the Yiddish vernacular.  This illustrated edition contains a general introduction to the Yiddish language, its grammar and pronunciation, and is arranged from right to left.\n### Section 4\n![img12_0.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img12_0.jpg)\n![img13.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img13.jpg)\nYiddish lexicography as a scientific endeavor came into its own during the 20th century.    Following the pioneering work of Harkavy, Nahum Stutchkoff and Max Weinreich continued the scientific study of the Yiddish language. Stutchkoff’s “Oytser” (thesaurus) lists “over one hundred fifty-thousand words, idioms, phrases and proverbs.”  The work is arranged “according to concepts,” and was accompanied by an alphabetical index.  It was published by the YIVO Institute, the major center for Yiddish and Eastern European Jewish studies (started in Vilna and transplanted to New York City), five years after the Holocaust.  The redacter’s son, Uriel Weinreich, later published a “Modern English-Yiddish Yiddish-English Dictionary” that became the standard reference work for students of Yiddish.\n## Contemporary Rabbinic Lexicography\nNew discovers, methodological innovations and technological breakthroughs have greatly enhanced our historical understanding of the meaning of ancient words.  Contemporary scholarship has benefited enormously from the discovery of new physical evidence, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, medieval manuscript fragments from Cairo, and epigraphic sources of information. There is a general recognition today of the methodological need to stop lumping Hebrew and Aramaic together and there is a keener understanding of the different regions and time periods implicit in rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic. Known sources have been reexamined in light of these new discoveries and increasingly sophisticated digital technologies and software applications have had a significant impact on traditional areas of humanistic research.\n\nThere is perhaps no better, albeit bitter-sweet, symbol of the revolutionary transformation of rabbinic scholarship on the cusp of the digital age than the monumental, multi-volume concordances to the Mishnah, the Tosefta and the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds compiled manually by Chaim Yehoshua Kasowsky, who died in 1960 and completed after his death by his son Biniamin. It is true that these alphabetical lists of words are essentially navigational aids, not dictionaries. Concordances can address issues of orthography and pronunciation, but certainly not signification or usage, at least not directly. Still, the Kasowskys’ manual achievements, accomplished over the course of more than four decades, frame this conclusion by pointing out that the basic manner in which Jastrow and his predecessors have worked has been on the wane for over two decades. Following are examples that reflect the nature of these changes for the evolving craft of rabbinic lexicography.\n### Section 1\n![kasovsky-comp.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/kasovsky-comp.jpg)\nWorking without the aid of a computer, the Kasowskys compiled hundreds of thousands of words in the course of creating their unprecedented concordances.  In the majority of their concordances, each word is arranged according to its root structure; each word has been meticulously vocalized; each noun, verb, adverb, adjective, preposition, particle, prefix and suffix formation has been assembled; each entry is accompanied by illustrative quotations and linguistic notes. Displayed here is the first of a five-volume supplement to a forty-two volume concordance started by Chaim Kasowsky in 1954. The supplement lists in alphabetical order all occurrences of personal names, nicknames and place names in the Babylonian Talmud and all the passages where they can be found.\n### Section 2\n![Fig. 1: Daniel Sperber, working with the Bar Ilan University Institute for Lexicography in Israel, has revised and moved far beyond the pioneering work of Samuel Krauss.

His Palestinian Aramaic Dictionary of the Byzantine period (2nd edition, 2002); his dictionary of Jewish Babylonia Aramaic of the Talmudic and Geonic periods (2002); and most recently his dictionary of Judean Aramaic (2003), which heavily relies on epigraphic sources, all reflect his methodological emphasis on the need to distinguish between different periods, morphologies and sources of Aramaic. Sokoloff has incorporated variant textual readings found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, in medieval manuscripts and in Cairo genizah fragments to establish a critical understanding of the vast sea of rabbinic literature. To reach his goals, he has utilized new tools and digital resources.  In the preface to his dictionary of Jewish Babylonia Aramaic, for example, Sokoloff states that “[...] the basis of the present dictionary was a database in the form of a Key Word in Context [concordance] (KWIC) of the entire corpus of rabbinic literature” (p. 18). Similarly, he has consulted the “Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon” (CAL) computer project, directed by S. Kaufman, at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, and the “Hebrew Language historical dictionary project” at the Academy of Hebrew Language in Jerusalem.\n### Section 4\n![img9_1.jpg](../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img9_1.jpg)\nThe historical dictionary of the Hebrew language, a project begun in 1959 by Zeev Ben Hayim, and currently headed by Abraham Tal, author of a dictionary of Samaritan Aramaic, is a monumental effort to provide a scientifically reliable guide to all periods and literary types of the Hebrew language, including “… the most reliable sources of Halakha and Aggada, liturgical texts, the Dead Sea Scrolls, documents and inscriptions, the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds, as well as from medieval, Haskala and modern literature.”  Its format is modeled on European historical dictionaries like the Oxford English Dictionary and employs a “quadruple system of signs” to indicate the accuracy of the transmitted source; the text-critical treatment of a source; its potentially bi-lingual (especially Hebrew-Aramaic) character; indications of the period or historical strata reflected by a particular source. Intended to be an up-to-date (and updatability) resource, the _Ma’agarim_ project utilizes the most recent lexicographical research and modern digital technologies.\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Brisman, Shimon.** _History and Guide to Judaic Dictionaries and Concordances._ (Hoboken, N.J.: Ktav Publishing House, 2000).\n    \n*   **Carmilly-Weinberger, Moshe.** _Eliezer Ben-Yehuda’s Modern Hebrew Dictionary and Jewish Scholars._ In _Studia Judaica,_ 8 (1999): 60–73.\n    \n*   **Epstein, Y.

fall of 2003 marked the 100th anniversary of the publication of the first major English-language dictionary of rabbinic literature: A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli, and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature … With an Index of Scriptural Quotations, compiled by Marcus Jastrow, a Philadelphia rabbi and a University of Pennsylvania honorary Doctor of Literature. Jastrow dedicated his dictionary to his wife Bertha Wolfsohn, with whom he had seven children, including their son Morris Jastrow, one of the founders of Religious Studies in the United States, professor of ancient Semitic languages and Penn’s University Librarian from 1898 until his death in 1921. Marcus Jastrow died in Germantown, Pennsylvania on October 13, 1903. This exhibit at Penn fittingly celebrates the anniversary of Jastrow’s dictionary and honors the centenary of its creator for his contributions to the distinguished tradition of rabbinic learning and lexicography.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Arthur Kiron, Curator of Judaica Collections\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Seth Jerchower, Public Services Librarian, Center for Advanced Judaic Studies Library.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>How do we know what words mean? What makes a definition authoritative? The modern dictionary (1) – its carefully derived etymologies (2), its hierarchically enumerated primary and secondary meanings, and its abundant literary citations of scattered historical usage – has been painstakingly compiled over the course of many centuries to respond to if not altogether answer these questions. What is known has been formatted with singular purpose and exquisite attention to detail. What is unknown or uncertain has been conscientiously omitted or else retained with a qualifying question mark. The end product of each lexical compilation, the dictionary entry, amounts to an encoded art form of presentation, concision and scholarly precision. The exact meaning of words has a book of its own: the dictionary.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This exhibit surveys a special field of dictionary-making called rabbinic lexicography (3). Rabbinic lexicography as a sub-species of dictionary-making refers to a roughly one thousand year-old corpus of literature that treats the Aramaic paraphrases of the Hebrew Bible known as Targum (4), as well as a sea of Jewish lore and legal expositions called Midrash (5) and Talmud (6). Rabbinic lexicography in a general sense can refer to successive generations of scholars, Jews and non-Jews, who have tried to understand and interpret the lexicon of post-Biblical Jewish learning. Their efforts have been complicated by the occurrence in rabbinic literature of a variety of unfamiliar loan words (e.g., from Greek, Latin, Persian, Arabic, and even Akkadian) and by the fact that Biblical and post-Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic writings were often copied without vowels (neḳudot) and accents (te’amim). Consequently, even one careless breath could alter the meaning of a sacred word. Over time, inconsistencies arose between written (ḳetiv) and spoken (ḳeri) reading traditions and among various textual witnesses; the uncertain meaning of exotic words also became increasingly problematic. To redress this situation, rabbinic scholars created new tools of exegesis (7).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The effort to extricate the words of rabbis from their literary contexts, re-arrange them alphabetically as discrete terms, define their meanings historically, and refine their modes of visual presentation evolved over many centuries. From targumic paraphrases and glossed rabbinic pages to the modern rabbinic dictionary entry, rabbinic lexicography has a complex history. It also forms a significant if often overlooked chapter in the general history of scholarship. As Solomon Schechter, a scholar of rabbinics, once put it: “dictionaries belong to that class of literature which is mostly studied but rarely quoted.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"glossary\">Glossary\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>(1) Dictionary. &#x3C; ad. med.

He grew up in a Yiddish-speaking family, in a German-speaking province, in what formerly had been part of the Kingdom of Poland before its three partitions between 1772 and 1795. Initially home-schooled in Hebrew and rabbinic studies, Jastrow graduated from a Prussian Gymnasium (high school) in the provincial capital of Posen in 1852. He then left for Berlin, the cosmopolitan center of Prussian culture, where he attended Berlin University while also being tutored in traditional rabbinics. Jastrow next pursued graduate studies at the University of Halle and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1855, at the age of twenty-six.  Two years later his rabbinical ordination (originally conferred in 1853 by Rabbi Moses Feilchenfeld), was confirmed and signed by Rabbi Wolf Landau, of Dresden. In 1858, on the eve of his thirtieth birthday, Jastrow moved to Warsaw to serve as a religious leader.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now living in Poland’s capital, Jastrow devoted himself to the mastery of the Polish language.  He also identified with and was active in the Polish independence movement. His involvement led to his arrest, imprisonment and eventual exile back to Prussia. In 1863, his decree of expulsion was revoked and Jastrow anticipated returning to his pulpit in Warsaw. With the outbreak of the Polish revolution that same year, however, his Prussian passport was abruptly canceled. Forced to earn a living elsewhere, Jastrow remained in Germany where he became the district rabbi of Worms. In 1866, at the age of thirty-seven, he accepted an invitation from Philadelphia to cross the Atlantic Ocean to become the officiating rabbi of that city’s Congregation Rodeph Shalom.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Jastrow introduced a new type of religious leadership and learning to America, one heavily influenced by the academic model of the German university, the spirit and methods of historical-critical inquiry, and the religious reform of Jewish theology and ritual observance. As David Werner Amram, a scholar of early Hebrew printing and friend, put it in a memorial address “[Jastrow’s] thought was a blend of Talmudism, classicism, and modernism.”  Jastrow’s arrival meant that familiarity with the best of European scholarship would now enter the mainstream of American Jewish cultural life. Indeed, Jastrow’s three major scholarly contributions – his English-Aramaic rabbinic dictionary, his role in the creation of the first English-language Jewish Encyclopedia, his contribution to the first Jewish critical translation into English of the Hebrew Bible – as well as the scholarship of his son Morris, all bear witness to this revolutionary cultural and intellectual transfer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-jastrow-dictionary\">The Jastrow Dictionary\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/pj5205_j3_1886-tp.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;pj5205_j3_1886-tp.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\n\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_02.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Jastrow_02.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Marcus Jastrow published the first edition of his dictionary in two volumes over the course of the last seventeen, illness-plagued years of his life.  A prefatory note dated July 1886 printed in the first volume details the plan for the complete future edition. But this single volume, covering only the first half of the Hebrew alphabet, was published, as is evident from the title page, in 1895. It may be the case that fascicles of the dictionary appeared prior to 1895 as installments of a work in progress. The complete two-volume set, however, would not appear until 1903, shortly before Jastrow’s death. In his preface to the 1903 edition, Jastrow acknowledged his scholarly debts, most notably to Jacob Levy, Alexander Kohut and to other major figures of 19th century German-Jewish scholarship. Unmentioned is the fact that the format of the Jastrow dictionary entry ultimately derives not from Jewish sources, however, but from a seventeenth-century Christian Hebraist lexicographer, Johannes Buxtorf.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"section-2\">Section 2\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/Jastrow_03.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;fig. 1: The second, “authorisited” [sic!], edition of the Jastrow dictionary was published in 1926 in one volume.

These efforts were by no means unprecedented. The Hebrew Bible itself contains traditions about the origins of specific Hebrew words and names. Early rabbinic literature—Mishnah, Tosefta, Gemarah, and Midrash—often employs etymological and grammatical interpretations of individual words as a means to achieve exegetical ends. For the Jews, the Hebrew consonants of the Bible embodied the fundamental elements of creation whose order—the Aleph-Bet (alphabet)—was designed by God. In the 7th century, a corpus devoted to the textual stabilization and authoritative transmission of the divine letters of the Hebrew Bible, the Masorah (from the Hebrew מסר, masar “to transmit, hand down”), began to appear. The Masoretes (the scholars who tried to determine the written text of the Hebrew Bible) intensively studied the formation and frequency of occurrence of the words of their received sacred writings. Jewish masoretic activity grew during the same period that Islamic scholars of Arabic and Christian scholars of Syriac (Christian Aramaic) began to investigate and classify their own respective languages. From the 7th-9th centuries, thus, the idea of the dictionary emerges as a systematic classification of the biblical lexicon into an organized inventory for consultation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>During the time of the masoretes, two sects of Judaism were consolidating. Rabbanite Jews followed the text of the Bible (Torah she-bi-khtav, the written tradition) and recognized the authority of orally transmitted traditions of interpretation (Torah she-be-‘al peh) by rabbis whose teachings were eventually collected and written down in two different recensions of what was called Talmud. About 760 C.E., the heads of the Jewish Academies in Babylonia elected Hananiah ben David exilarch, the head of Babylonian diasporic Jewry. Hananiah, however, was second in the line of succession. His older brother Anan ben David, first in line, rebelled against the academies and the proponents of the Talmud, and delclared himself anti-exilarch. Anan rejected the legitimacy of the rabbanite traditions of interpretation and instead claimed the Bible, not the rabbis and their schools, as the authoritative voice of tradition. Anan’s followers were known as Karaites (from the Hebrew קרא ḳara —“ to call out or read,” i.e., the Bible). Both Karaites and Rabbanites believed in the sacred authority of the Hebrew Bible and both sects perpetuated the masoretic tradition. Rabbanites, however, possessed an additional, and immense, literary corpus repudiated by the Karaites. The Geonim (the heads of the rabbanite academies of Babylonia) Sa‘adiah ben Joseph al-Fayyumi (882-942), and Ḥai ben Sherira (939–1038) composed the first rabbinic lexicons in the 9th and 10th centuries. Much of the evidence for this period’s activity, some of which is on display here, is known today from the recovery of medieval texts stored—disposed of—in the attic of one synagogue in Fustat, the old city of Cairo. This remarkable storehold (genizah) of fragmentary documents is known as the Cairo Genizah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"section-1\">Section 1\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/image2.jpeg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;fig. 1: This Genizah fragment is from a commentary on a piyyut, or liturgical poem, in which thirteen difficult and rare words are used.

Rashi was a student of the head of the German academy in Mainz, Rabbenu Gershom (c. 960-1028). His commentaries to both the Bible and the Talmud remain as the fundamental key to the \u003Cem>peshat\u003C/em>, that is, “plain, basic meaning” of these texts.  Rashi’s contribution to rabbinic lexicography assumes the form of glosses, which include translations in old French (Rashi’s vernacular) of difficult and rare words throughout the Bible and Talmud. Rashi’s commentaries transmit the best known and most widely diffused of this glossary tradition. For the Bible, the masoretes  had already identified most of these rare and obscure words. Rashi, then and since the most important commentator, was one of a number of glossers active throughout France, Provence, Spain, and Italy to offer a traditional word-by-word translation and explanation of the biblical Hebrew text.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 1102 Nathan ben Jehiel of Rome (1035-ca. 1110) completed his magnum opus, the \u003Cem>‘Arukh\u003C/em> (“thesaurus”). From an ancient family of Roman Jewish scholars (Anaw), Nathan’s peregrinations would bring him to Sicily, Narbonne, Pavia, and Bari, and finally back to Rome before 1070.  Nathan was exposed to the last generation of Babylonian scholarship, the school of Cordoba, and Franco-Ashkenaz exegesis. The \u003Cem>‘Arukh\u003C/em> would mark the most comprehensive lexicon of rabbinic Hebrew, encompassing the entire rabbinic literary corpus.  It has since stood as the rabbinic Hebrew dictionary \u003Cem>par excellence\u003C/em>:  not merely a dictionary, Nathan provides ample citations for his hundreds of sources, not an insignificant number of which are otherwise unknown.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What Nathan did for the talmudic corpus, David Kimḥi (1160-ca. 1235) would do for the biblical corpus. The scion of the family, Joseph ben Isaac Kimḥi (1105-ca. 1170), a follower of Ibn Janah, was forced out Muslim Spain during the Almohades persecutions of 1146. Joseph settled in Narbonne, in Christian Provençe. Both he and his older son Moses (d. ca. 1190) defined the same system of verbal constructions and conjugations in use today. Joseph’s younger son David was raised under Moses’ mentorship. His grammar, the \u003Cem>Sefer Mikhlol\u003C/em>, a masterful reconciliation of the contrasting schools of Menaḥem and Dunash, became the definitive rabbinic grammar of biblical Hebrew. The second part of the \u003Cem>Mikhlol\u003C/em> took its name from Ibn Janah’s dictionary: the \u003Cem>Sefer ha-Shorashim\u003C/em>, or “Book of Roots. ”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eight books, at most, were produced by the first Hebrew printing press, active in Rome from ca. 1469-1472.  Among the six Hebrew imprints definitely produced in Rome at this time, were Rashi’s \u003Cem>Commentary to the Pentateuch\u003C/em>, Nathan ben Jehiel’s \u003Cem>‘Arukh\u003C/em> , and the \u003Cem>Sefer ha-Shorashim\u003C/em> by David Kimḥi.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-arukh-of-nathan-ben-jehiel\">The ‘Arukh of Nathan ben Jehiel\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/image_jpeg2.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;fig. 1 fragment from the Cairo Genizah, shows the entries for אוב, אובא — ’uv, uva’ tamya’—Hebrew and Aramaic terms found in the Bible, Targum and Gemara, which Jastrow translates into English as “ghost, necromancer”.

Rabbinic lexicography was a key area of research profoundly affected by new methods of comparative linguistic analysis and by controversial efforts to differentiate the chronological strata of religious literature. The general spirit of the age was reflected in the founding in Berlin in 1819 of a Society (\u003Cem>Verein\u003C/em>) to promote what would come to be known as the \u003Cem>Wissenschaft des Judentums\u003C/em> (“Science of Judaism”).  In the first and only volume of the Society’s journal, the programmatic study of Judaism proclaimed there is animated by a clear desire to belong to the mainstream of modern research; new historical criteria would be required for the study and evaluation of the history and literature of the Jews; new periodizations would be introduced to delineate the way the Jewish experience changed over time. Despite its apologetic impulses and practical communal concerns, the goal of the movement was to create an objective, scientific understanding of the Jewish past on par with the non-Jewish histories that characterized their time. This new science of Judaism rapidly spread across Europe and entered the curricula of institutions of higher Jewish learning like the \u003Cem>Jüdisch-Theologisches Seminar,\u003C/em> established in Breslau in 1854.

These specialized dictionaries reflected new advances in the critical study of rabbinic literature and addressed a practical need to better understand obscure words and concepts.   Specialized lexicons also were produced to help students decipher mysterious forms of rabbinic abbreviations.   Acronyms and initials (\u003Cem>rashe tevot\u003C/em>), acrostics (\u003Cem>notarikonim\u003C/em>) and elided spellings (\u003Cem>kitsurim\u003C/em>) severely handicapped inexperienced readers.   For those seeking entrée into this closed world, as well as for those with advanced training, abbreviations posed special difficulties because a single abbreviation could refer to a multitude of possible meanings.   The abbreviation “a-b-a” (aleph-bet-aleph), for example, potentially can refer to 1) the word for “father”; 2) a genealogical relationship (“his sister, daughter of his father”); 3) any of a variety of rabbinic personalities quoted in the literature; 4) an indication of an alternative explanation; 5) “literally”; etc.. In addition to dictionaries of abbreviations, specialized subject dictionaries of legal, philosophical scientific and medical terms as well as dictionaries of pseudonyms and bio-bibliographies also were published.   The field of rabbinic lexicography, in short, developed its own polyglot sub-specializations, both as a consequence of new critical-historical research and in response to the needs of the time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"section-1-6\">Section 1\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img1.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;img1.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Adolph Jellinek, the renowned preacher and scholar, served as rabbi at Leipzig from 1845 to 1856 and at Vienna from 1857 until his death there in 1893.

What had once been taken to be eternal and unchanging was now shown to have evolved over time. Ancient languages, such as Ugaritic and Akkadian were being discovered and deciphered while stupendous new archeological discoveries were changing the face of the historical past.   To further complicate matters, Jews were engaged in the greatest population movement in their entire history as they migrated from Central and Eastern Europe to North America and Palestine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the face of these modern upheavals, one seemingly unremarkable element of rabbinic lexicography quietly remained virtually unchanged. Not unlike the way the formatted page of the rabbinic Bible and the Talmud in the 16th century was patterned on Christian scholastic glossed texts, modern Jewish rabbinic lexicographers continued to replicate the format of the dictionary entry popularized by the Christian Hebraist lexicographer Johannes Buxtorf, the Elder. This is especially evident in the formatting of Jacob Levy’s rabbinic dictionary, considered the first modern critical work of its kind. From Buxtorf to Jacob Levy to Alexander Kohut to Marcus Jastrow to Barukh Krupnik, continuity of form, if not content, persisted.   Those who adopted a scientific approach to the study of religious texts, no matter where that path might take them, often invested their methods with a new kind of rational conviction.   Consequently, the task of the rabbinic lexicographer (secular or devout, Jewish or Christian), like the format of the lexical entry itself, would in some sense remain the same: to establish the authentic meaning of the most sacred words on the most secure grounds and in the most stable way possible\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"section-1-7\">Section 1\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img1_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;img1_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\n\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img2_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;img2_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\n\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img3_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;img3_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\n\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img4_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;img4_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\nJacob Levy is widely regarded as the founder of modern critical rabbinic lexicography and his dictionary had a tremendous influence on subsequent scholarship. In particular, Levy is credited with promoting the importance of the study of Syriac for determining the correct reading and/or etymology of a given word — probably relying, as Michael Sokoloff surmises, on the \u003Cem>Lexicon heptaglotton\u003C/em> of Edmund Castell. His format, however, is clearly patterned after that of Buxtorf’s Lexicon chaldaicum.  Levy’s dictionary was published in at least two distinct editions, under two different titles. The first edition, \u003Cem>Chaldäisches Wörterbuch über die Targumim,\u003C/em> was published in Leipzig (1867-1868).

By his own account, Kohut was thirteen years old when he first set out to thoroughly revise the ‘Arukh of Nathan ben Yehiel after he was unable to find what he was looking for in Moses Landau’s revised edition of it.   Subsequently, Kohut started correcting and/or expanding Nathan’s entries and quotations from rabbinic literature and the project eventually turned into a systematic revision of all the subsequent scholarship.   Notably, Kohut made use of previously uncited sources and new critical tools, such as the variant readings of rabbinic texts compiled in Raphael Rabinowitz’s cumbersome \u003Cem>Dikduke Soferim.\u003C/em>  Kohut completed his scholarly efforts in the United States after moving from his post as rabbi of Nagyvard (German: Grosswardein, in Hungary ), to New York City in May of 1885 and died there in 1894.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"section-3-8\">Section 3\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img8_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;img8_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\nJastrow’s dictionary, while generally well-received, also endured a fair amount of criticism.

For Eliezer ben-Yehudah, credited with reviving Hebrew as a spoken language, foreign words and languages, ancient or European, needed to be purged from the Hebrew vernacular before a new, national Jewish language could be born. Consequently, Ben-Yehuda deliberately omitted many Aramaic and other “foreign” words from his modern Hebrew dictionary and invented many neologisms of his own. At the same time, the Committee for the Expansion of the Hebrew Language that he founded had to take into account the autonomous character of Hebrew as a living language. Newly minted words in the language laboratory were not always accepted by Hebrew speakers. The Zionist notion of the “negation of the diaspora” (\u003Cem>shelilat ha-galut\u003C/em>)—associated with the concept of the ingathering of the Jewish people to their national homeland from their foreign places of residence—also expressed itself through the politicization of language. Yiddish, a language born in the diaspora and spoken by the majority of world Jewry, was perceived by Ben-Yehuda and others as a threat to the revival of Hebrew.  At the tumultuous Yiddish Language Conference held in Czernowitz in 1908 Yiddishists, reacting against the nationalization of Hebrew, rejected Hebrew as a dead language reserved for prayer and declared Yiddish to be a truly national living Jewish language.\nThis controversial relationship between Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people and Yiddish as the spoken mother tongue of the largest Jewish population centers outside the Land of Israel , persisted.  The politics of language began to soften only decades after the founding of the state of Israel when “diaspora” languages like Yiddish, once banned from the Israeli classroom, received renewed popular and academic interest.  But throughout this time, Yiddishisms had already found their way into modern spoken Hebrew. Hebraisms meanwhile always had existed in Yiddish.  Dictionaries of both bore unmistakable traces of the classical rabbinic Aramaic lexicon.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"section-1-8\">Section 1\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/ben-yehuda-comp.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Fig. 1: The Lithuanian-born Perelman became a passionate Zionist and more than anyone else is credited with reviving Hebrew as a spoken language in the Land of Israel.

As a modern Yiddish lexicographer, Harkavy, not unlike what Ben-Yehuda did for the Hebrew language, helped pioneer the rebirth of Yiddish as a literary language and defended its status against those who regarded it as an unseemly “zhargon.” He established the first Yiddish newspaper in Canada (\u003Cem>Di Tsayt\u003C/em>), founded other Yiddish periodicals, and published a large volume of practical handbooks, translations of European literature into Yiddish, literary criticism as well as scholarly articles.  This second, revised edition (first edition, 1891) of Harkavy’s dictionary is bi-lingual (English to Yiddish only).  Each English word is vocalized in the Hebrew alphabet for the practical use of the Yiddish speakers trying to learn English.  At the end of the work are lists of personal names, place names, and foreign terms, arranged alphabetically in English to Yiddish (from left to right on the page).  Purists of the Yiddish language criticized Harkavy for introducing too many words of modern German, rather than of traditional Yiddish origin, as well as popular Anglicized Yiddish vocabulary, such as ‘vindo’ (window).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"section-3-9\">Section 3\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img10_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;img10_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\n\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/TheMeaningofWords/img11_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;img11_0.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\nThe Russian-born Spivak, a physician and writer, and the Lithuanian-born Bloomgarden, one of the major translators of European literature into Yiddish, collaborated in the United States to produce a Yiddish dictionary that paid special attention to the occurrence of Biblical and rabbinic terms in the Yiddish vernacular.

Following the pioneering work of Harkavy, Nahum Stutchkoff and Max Weinreich continued the scientific study of the Yiddish language. Stutchkoff’s “Oytser” (thesaurus) lists “over one hundred fifty-thousand words, idioms, phrases and proverbs.”  The work is arranged “according to concepts,” and was accompanied by an alphabetical index.  It was published by the YIVO Institute, the major center for Yiddish and Eastern European Jewish studies (started in Vilna and transplanted to New York City), five years after the Holocaust.  The redacter’s son, Uriel Weinreich, later published a “Modern English-Yiddish Yiddish-English Dictionary” that became the standard reference work for students of Yiddish.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"contemporary-rabbinic-lexicography\">Contemporary Rabbinic Lexicography\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>New discovers, methodological innovations and technological breakthroughs have greatly enhanced our historical understanding of the meaning of ancient words.  Contemporary scholarship has benefited enormously from the discovery of new physical evidence, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, medieval manuscript fragments from Cairo, and epigraphic sources of information. There is a general recognition today of the methodological need to stop lumping Hebrew and Aramaic together and there is a keener understanding of the different regions and time periods implicit in rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic. Known sources have been reexamined in light of these new discoveries and increasingly sophisticated digital technologies and software applications have had a significant impact on traditional areas of humanistic research.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is perhaps no better, albeit bitter-sweet, symbol of the revolutionary transformation of rabbinic scholarship on the cusp of the digital age than the monumental, multi-volume concordances to the Mishnah, the Tosefta and the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds compiled manually by Chaim Yehoshua Kasowsky, who died in 1960 and completed after his death by his son Biniamin. It is true that these alphabetical lists of words are essentially navigational aids, not dictionaries. Concordances can address issues of orthography and pronunciation, but certainly not signification or usage, at least not directly. Still, the Kasowskys’ manual achievements, accomplished over the course of more than four decades, frame this conclusion by pointing out that the basic manner in which Jastrow and his predecessors have worked has been on the wane for over two decades.

Sokoloff has incorporated variant textual readings found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, in medieval manuscripts and in Cairo genizah fragments to establish a critical understanding of the vast sea of rabbinic literature. To reach his goals, he has utilized new tools and digital resources.

What defines each of these religious cultures, however, is not only their common heritage in the Biblical past but the distinctive traditions that each of them has developed for interpreting the Bible and what they believed to be its message and meaning. Indeed, it is the different ways in which they have interpreted the Bible that have decisively shaped the development of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. And all too often, perhaps, their different understandings of the Bible have also determined and complicated the tangled relations of these religious communities with each other.\n\nHistorically, the distinctive character of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Biblical interpretation is reflected not only in the substance of their exegetical traditions but equally so in the material forms through which their authors have recorded and transmitted their interpretations. These have ranged from modes of oral recitation to scrolls to books of many different kinds. In some cases, in fact, particular religious groups consciously adopted new or different material forms for transmitting their sacred Scriptures or exegetical traditions precisely in order to distinguish and differentiate themselves from each other. In other cases, the similarity of their material forms belies the oft-repeated claims of each tradition to absolute originality and uniqueness, and demonstrates, in fact, their frequent dependence and shared qualities.\n\nIn this virtual exhibit, Fellows of the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies share with you some examples of the different exegetical traditions they have found most intriguing, and the various material forms in which those traditions have been recorded. Participating fellows have each chosen an example, written a short description of it and picked a sample illustration to go with it. Each of these examples may be found in the library of the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies or at the main library of the University of Pennsylvania (unless otherwise noted). These examples, as you will see, trace the history of these traditions of interpretation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and their changing material forms, from the ancient period to the early modern. And while our examples are far from exhaustive - even with the endless possibilities of virtual reality, we still could not manage to include oral tradition - it is our hope that these selections will show you both the variety and commonality of Biblical interpretation that has informed the three main religious communities of Western culture.\n\nDavid Stern\n\n# Exhibit\n\n## Bible & Inner Biblical Exegesis\n\n### Facing Destruction and Exile: Inner-Biblical Exegesis in Jeremiah and Ezekiel\n![Fig. 1: Measuring only 17 cm in height, this was only the third edition of the complete Hebrew Bible, and the first to have been printed in the octavo format.

In his colophon (printer's statement) the scion of the great Hebrew printing dynasty writes: _I chose to print this Bible in a small format so that, day and night, it might accompany its reader, who may easily carry this book, to read it wherever walking, wherever lying down, wherever rising up.._\n\n\nPictured here are two passages from the Book of Ezekiel (Chapter 20) that highlight one of the major issues that preoccupied the Jews in the beginning of the Babylonian exile (597 BCE onwards). Moreover, the verses demonstrate the phenomenon of inner-biblical interpretation.\n\nInner-biblical exegesis and allusion suggest diverse points of view about the interrelationship between texts written over a vast geographical as well as chronological span. Scholars have identified constitutive assumptions that guided biblical authors in the exertion of inner interpretation. Three of them are considered essential for both allusion and exegesis. First, deliberate literary connections relate a later-alluding text to its earlier-source text. Second, the source text is considered authoritative and valid to the present. Third, among other reasons, the motivation of the alluding text is often to accord the present disastrous reality with the theological traditional concepts and with the historical heritage.\n\nExamining the phenomenon of interpretation, the prophets are usually held responsible for the inner interpretation. However, inner-biblical exegesis is not restricted to the prophets at all. Focusing on one social-historical setting can illuminate the evolvement of inner-biblical interpretation. Debates and disputation-speeches in the Books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel elucidate an exegetical discourse between the prophets and their audiences, quoted as \"other voices\" in Jerusalem and in Babylon. Coping with kernel questions of existence in face of the destruction and the exiles, the opponents rely on different types of source texts. Nevertheless, they share one of the most constructive aspects of exegesis, namely Correlation, consisting of two contrasting phases: Analogy and Polarity. Based on different lines of argumentation, each of the quotations and their prophetical refutations treat this mode of Correlation differently. Yet the motives of the speakers and the prophets are equally exegetical. Thus, inner-biblical interpretation can be traced down in non-prophetical sources as well. This reveals a multifaceted internal exegesis already within biblical texts of the first half of the sixth century BCE.\n\nDalit Rom-Shiloni\n\n\n### King Solomon made him a palanquin of wood from Lebanon . . .

Some scholars claim that this song was composed in honor of King Solomon's marriage to the daughter of a foreign king, possibly Pharaoh's daughter. If this assumption is correct then this song embodies the oldest song in the book of the Song of Songs; it forms the Book's nucleus and all the other poems were assembled and composed around it.\n\nThe Song of Songs Rabbah (an exegetical Midrash, that comprises sayings of sages that lived in the land of Israel, between the first and fourth century CE, although it was redacted at somewhat later period) on these verses introduces a series of five allegorical interpretations on verses 9-10. Each interpretation (Petira) represents a complete and systematic allegorical exegesis for these verses. The palanquin is used as an image to following themes: the Tabernacle, the Ark, the Temple, the Creation of the World and the Throne of Glory.  \n\nTamar Kadari\n\n\n### Syriac Biblical Exegesis\n![img_29.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_29.png)\nFig 1\n![Fig. 2: Rear cover, showing details of original binding.

Stitching at center and left effectively repairs splits in the wooden board.\n\n \n\nThe Syriac language, a dialect of Aramaic, is the liturgical language of the Christians of the East. Beginning in the third century at least Syriac-speaking Christians flourished in Mesopotamia. The various communities lived along the ever-changing borderlands between the Roman and Persian Empires and later between the Byzantine and Arab empires. They thrived and grew amidst the cross-cultural admixture of the late ancient Near East.\n\nAccording to tradition, Edessa and its king were converted to Christianity in the second century by Addai (Thaddeus?) one of the 70 disciples of Luke 10.1 This history is recorded in the Syriac treatise, the Doctrine of Addai. Whether this trajectory is accurate or not, the Bible was soon translated into Syriac at Edessa. The Peshitta of the Old Testament was probably first translated from the Hebrew for the Jewish community, but it eventually became standard for the Christians. The New Testament gospels circulated in several versions, one of which, the Evangelion da-Mehallate, was a homogenization of the four gospels into one.\n\nFrom the fourth-century onward the Christian community produced many homiletic, exegetical and liturgical works. The fourth-century produced the likes of Ephrem Syrus who was known for his lyrical poetry and extensive biblical commentaries as well as community leadership. Ephrem's older contemporary Aphrahat the Persian Sage interpreted biblical passages in unique (among fourth-century Christians) ways. His Persian-Mesopotamian Semitic milieu, minimally influenced by the developing Greco-Roman Christian tradition, afforded Aphrahat the opportunity to innovate in his biblical readings. Yet, much of his homiletic writings reflect similar patterns in the contemporaneous rabbinic writings illuminating the cross-cultural matrices of the late ancient Near East.\n\nSyriac writing continued to flourish into the Arab period. Yet as Arabic became the lingua franca of the Syriac Christian community in the Arab lands, Syriac was relegated mostly for liturgical uses. The page of manuscript displayed here is from an 18th century Takhsa damkurayya, a written betrothal agreement. This manuscript is written in the Nestorian hand, one of the three standard Syriac scripts.  \n\nNaomi Koltun-Fromm\n\n\n### The Bible as Read: The Idea of Election in the Ritual of Scriptural Reading\n![img_31.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_31.png)\nFig. 1\n![Fig. 2: The highlighted lines at bottom show the blessing cited in Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 11b: \"who has chosen us from all peoples and given us the Torah.\" The highlighted section above contains the respective blessings: \"who has not made me a heathen\" (goy), and \"who has not made me a woman.\" Both are crossed out; note that the text to the first blessing has been entirely obliterated, due to censorship.](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_32.png)\nFig. 2: The highlighted lines at bottom show the blessing cited in Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 11b: \"who has chosen us from all peoples and given us the Torah.\" The highlighted section above contains the respective blessings: \"who has not made me a heathen\" (goy), and \"who has not made me a woman.\" Both are crossed out; note that the text to the first blessing has been entirely obliterated, due to censorship.\n\n\nThe blessings recited before and after the scriptural reading defines the reading as something separated from everyday life, as a ritual. In the blessing which is recited before the Torah reading, we meet the idea of the election of Israel:\n\n\"Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has chosen us from all peoples and given us the Torah\" (Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 11b)\n\nScholars explain that this blessing emphasizes the connection between the election of Israel and giving the Torah. The election of Israel was implemented by giving them the Torah. But why is the idea of election is mentioned here, in the context of reading the Torah in public? What role does this blessing fulfill in this specific liturgical context?\n\nIt appears that the election of Israel in the Torah blessing is connected to the \"democratization\" of the public reading in the rabbinic custom. In ancient sources where rituals of Torah reading are found, the reader is always a priest or the political leader. In \"Hakhel\" gathering, at the festival of Sukkoth after the seventh year (the Shemitah), the king is the one who reads from the Torah (Deuteronomy 31,10-13; Mishnah Sotah 7,8). In the description of the public reading in Nehemiah 8, the reader is Ezra the priest, and in the description of the Torah reading after the service of the high priest at the Day of Atonement, the reader is the high priest himself (Mishnah Yoma 7,1). The same picture rises from Philos' description of the Torah reading on Saturdays (Hypothetica 7.12-13). Compared to that we find a very different picture in the rabbinic literature. According to the rabbinic sources every Jew (in principle) may read the Torah, not only the priest or the leader (Tosefta Megilah 3,11). It appears that the idea of election of Israel that mentioned in the Torah blessing is not an abstract theological idea. It is rather connected to the performance of scriptural reading. In order to justify the active participation of lay people in this worship, which is not trivial at all, the reader mentions in his blessing that God elected the entire people of Israel and gave them his Torah.  \n\nAdiel Kadari\n\n\n## Dead Sea Scrolls\n\n### Lamentations at Qumran\n![img_5.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_5.png)\n \nMore interesting than the recent controversies surrounding their publication are the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves, especially what they tell us about how the Bible was used and interpreted by this Jewish community at Qumran. All the books of the Hebrew Bible except for Esther have been found among the Scrolls, most in multiple copies, and several with commentaries (pesharim). Among the most popular books were Genesis, Deuteronomy, Isaiah, and Psalms, but verses from all the books could find their way into the community's own writings, in the form of proof texts, citations, and allusions. The allusions are a particularly subtle but effective way to make the Bible relevant to a contemporary situation.\n\nSuch is the case with Lamentations, a book commemorating the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. Many verses from Lamentations were woven throughout two lament-like poems from Qumran giving voice to the community's sense of alienation from other Jews. To the people at Qumran, Jerusalem was still destroyed (since they rejected as being corrupt the Jerusalem priesthood and worship at the Second Temple). They likened their Jewish opponents, in the war of words over biblical interpretation and religious doctrine and observance, to the Babylonians of old, who were responsible for Jerusalem's destruction. They felt besieged, mentally and spiritually, if not physically, no less than their ancestors in 586. The people at Qumran were, in their own eyes, the true heirs of biblical Israel, and their use of the Bible reflects and supports that belief.\n\nAdele Berlin\n\n## Rabbinic Midrash & Patristic Exegesis\n\n### The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael\n\n![img.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img.png)\n![img_1.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_1.png)\nThe _Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael_ is one of the earliest midrashim, or rabbinic commentaries on the Bible, and signals the emergence of Rabbinic Judaism in the early centuries of the Common Era. Its line-by-line, even word by word, commentary on large sections of the book of Exodus makes it a literary and conceptual counterpoint and complement to the non-exegetical Mishnah. One of the key features of this midrash is its interweaving of detailed legal commentary with non-legal (or aggadic) interpretation into one cohesive work. The _Mekhilta,_ like the other halakhic midrashim, presents the complexity of the rabbinic exegetical tradition, demonstrating both its unique conception of a densely significant rabbinic scripture, as well as dramatizing the forms of dialogical and dialectical thinking that become the hallmarks of rabbinic composition.\n\nIn recent years scholars have revised their understanding of the place of the rabbis in the first three centuries of the Common Era. Where rabbinic texts were once assumed to represent a sort of Normative Judaism of the post Temple era, and the rabbis to be the leaders of the Jewish community living under Roman rule, we now understand the early rabbis to have been a small and decentralized \"movement,\" claiming few adherents outside their own limited circles. This shift in historical thinking means we need to return to these texts and read them anew. The text above is part of an introduction to the civil laws collected in the Mekhilta (Tractate Mishpatim or Nezikin) and worries about the status of rabbinic legal authority in a Roman world. It is one of the texts that invites the reader to re-imagine the group that composed this midrash to be marginal, but ambitious, asserting an exegetical authority able and willing to lead the Jewish community.\n\nNatalie Dohrmann\n\n### Patristics and Portraiture? Typological Interpretation\n![img_3.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_3.png)\nPatristic typological interpretation of Scripture must be distinguished from other varieties of typology like the recurrence of a character type, e.g., \"holy man\" or \"martyr,\" or the assimilation of later figures to a superior antecedent model, e.g., Moses, David. Typological interpretation is applied primarily to the Old Testament, although types are identified in the New Testament as well. Types may be persons, objects, or patterns of events. They are regarded as antecedent to, but, in effect, retrojected from later realities which are considered their fulfillments. Types are regarded as predictive of and propaedeutic to their fulfillments, which may be evangelical, ecclesial, or eschatological. While they must have a distinct similarity to the persons, objects, events which they prefigure, a type is always an inferior approximation of a revelation to come.\n\nDan Sheerin\n\n\n### The Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer\n![img_2.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_2.png)\nA late Midrash that is \"rewriting\" the biblical events from creation to the story of the punishment of Miriam for her criticism of Moses (Num. 12). The work alludes to Arab rule on one side (chapters 28, 30) but on the other side uses traditions that were adopted from the Apocrypha and the Pseudepigrapha.\n\nThis eighth-century midrash was attributed to R. Eliezer b. Hyrcanus and frequently called Baraita de-Rabbi Eliezer in medieval rabbinic literature. This attribution, its mystical air and the way that the midrash is dealing with subjects of halakhah built up its popularity. Many manuscripts have been preserved, and it was reprinted time and again after its first publication in Constantinople 1514.\n\nThe most popular edition of the midrash, itself reprinted many times over, is the Warsaw 1852 with a commentary by R. David Luria, and with lacunae due to censorship. A semi-critical edition by C. M. Horowitz was published in Jerusalem, 1972 as a facsimile, and is based on the Venice 1544 edition.\n\nJacob Elbaum\n\n### The Pesikta Rabbati and Christian Hebraism in Italy\n![img_4.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_4.png)\nThe Pesikta Rabbati is a collection of midrashic readings that were recommended for particular holidays and occasions. The text appears to have been redacted in Palestine sometime before the ninth century, although certain elements may be as early as the fourth century. Very few manuscripts have survived, but those that have, particularly the Parma, Casantensis (Rome) and CJS (formerly \"Dropsie\"; also known as the \"London manuscript\"), differ significantly from the printed editions. With respect to the printed versions, the manuscripts present a wider and more complete range of texts. They also differ in that they present variants that positively link the Pesikta Rabbati to the Minhag Yerushalmi, or Minhag Erets Israel, that is, the Palestinian rite. By the thirteenth century, Palestinian Jewish communities had been assimilated into communities that followed the predominant Babylonian (\"Bavli\") custom. The Pesikta Rabbati, especially in its manuscript witnesses, remains one of the limited number of sources informing us on the practices of the now long extinct Palestinian community.\n\nSeth Jerchower\n## Medieval Jewish, Christian & Islamic Exegesis\n### Scripture in Islamic Tradition\n![img_25.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_25.png)\n![img_24.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_24.png)\n\nFor Muslims, as for Jews and Christians, the notion of scripture lies at the core of faith. That a common scriptural heritage links all three faiths is already announced in the Qur'an, which refers to followers of the shared Judaeo-Christian tradition with the phrase \"ahl al-kitab\" (\"people of the Book,\" e.g., 3:199). The Qur'an is, of course, \"the Book about which there is no doubt, guidance for the God-fearing\" (2:2). But the Qur'an also suggests that it is only the most recent iteration of the very same \"the Book\" on which its sister faiths are founded. God says \"We brought the family of Abraham the Book and wisdom\" (4:54). God also \"revealed the Book which Moses brought, as light and guidance for the people\" (6:91). Jesus receives from God, \"the Book, wisdom, the Torah, and the Evangelium\" (5:110). God's message reaches its final form with Muhammad, whom God sends, following in the path of these biblical figures, as \"a messenger\" to \"recite His signs and teach ... the Book and wisdom\" (2:129).\n\nJoseph Lowry\n\n \n### Liturgy and Music in Byzantium\n![Fig. 1: Illuminated floral carapaces in brightly colored weavings common to a Dalmatian or Southern Balkan pallet.

Possible Italianate influence in decorative traceries.\n\n![img_22.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_22.png)\nThe specific genre of collections of liturgical texts known as a Stikherarion usually contain the Stikhera, or verses specific to the daily, festal or sanctoral commemorations for the services of Vespers and Matins (Orthros) for the liturgical year. These volumes often, but not always contain musical notation. These stikhera, fixed in number, are inserted between the final verses of the fixed psalms appointed in the ordo for the daily cycle of vespers and matins. Three sets of stikhera make up the bulk of a complete Stikherarion: from the Menaion [a set of 12 books, one for each month, containing the variable hymns and text appointed for vespers and orthros of the fixed yearly cycle ]; from the Triodion [the liturgical collection containing the variable parts of the services for the moveable Lenten and Paschal cycle] and the Pentekostarion [the liturgical collection containing the appointed variable elements for the 50 day Pentecost cycle; these two separate larger collections excerpted and combined into one volume for the Stikherarion] and from the Oktoechos [a liturgical collection containing the texts for the daily cycles for every day of the year excluding Lent, arranged according to each of the eight modal cycles, or echoi]. Stikhera were frequently included for special saint's days or feasts of local significance. Presumably both the sheer mass of the material involved, and the fact of its seasonal or cyclic usage divided these volumes into separate collections.\n\nAn 11th C. revision of the post-iconoclastic controversy Stikherarion (with sanctoral additions and deletions subsequent to those controversies) continued in use until the 15th century, when a similar revision occurred, and when more highly developed (ornamented and melismatic; Neo-Byzantine notation) melodies replaced the previous simpler, syllabic notation. Several hundred stikheraria survive, each normally containing about 2000 Stikhera.\n\nAccording to the dedicatory colophon [97v], RAR Ms. 226 was collected and arranged by Iakovos [James] the 'Protopsaltis' [Head Chanter] and completed by George of Smyrna on 25 October 1800. Written on glazed paper in a precise secretarial cursive with a ferrite black inking for the text and Neo-Byzantine musical neumes written above the text, and a cuprite rose-red inking for rubrical and modal superscriptions, Capitals and leads to inter-stikheral verses.\n\nThe size, abridgement and decorative illumination of RAR Ms. 226 may point more to private usage rather than as part of a formal ecclesiastical aumbry. Such privately owned volumes became increasingly popular in the late 15th C and often functioned in the same manner as private books of hours did in the Latin traditions of the Middle Ages and Renaissance.\n\nJosef Gulka\n\n \n### Judeo-Arabic Polemics\n![Fig. 1: The author of this leaf, a fragment from the Cairo Genizah, refutes the astronomical soundness of the Christian calendar in general, and of the computation of Easter in particular.

It was aimed by Jews against other faiths, and within Judaism between Karaites and Rabbanites. In fact every Karaite Halakhic or exegetical work contains extensive polemical sections.\n\nThe Geonic period (9th-11th centuries) opens an entirely new chapter in the history of Jewish learning and Jewish culture. New activity in Halakhic monographs, Biblical exegesis and religious philosophy, starts suddenly, from nothing as it were, with very little antecedents to rely on. The beginning of this new chapter is coupled with a most fundamental cultural change, namely the emergence of Judeo-Arabic culture. Jews adopted the Arabic language, indeed Arab culture, for all needs and purposes. This important change affected all areas of literary activity, both religious and secular, with the exception of liturgical poetry. As a result of this change Jews shared the same language with all other inhabitants of the political system of Islam - Muslims, Christians (a very large and conspicuous community within the boundaries of Islam) and members of other faiths. Socially it involved all segments of the Jewish population, including the highest echelons of Jewish spiritual and cultural leadership of the largest communities at the time. The importance of this change cannot be overestimated, as it brought Jewish spiritual activity in direction contact and interaction with the cultural environment at large (including Islam, Christianity and the heritage of Classical philosophy and sciences). It should be mentioned though that as a rule Judeo-Arabic (with the exception of several hundred Karaite Medieval manuscripts) is written in Hebrew script (like some more recent Jewish languages). This has constituted in some measure a cultural divide between Jews and members of other faiths. Judeo-Arabic has been used by Arabic speaking Jews until the 20th century.\n\nThe Geonic period witnessed also the most important development in the history of Jewish sectarianism during the Middle Ages, namely the schism between Rabbanites and Karaites. In principle the Karaites rejected (and still do to this day) the authority of the Rabbinic tradition in favor of independent interpretation of the Bible. In practical terms this led to the development of an independent system of commandments and prohibitions. The differences between them and other Jews were most evident in the areas of communal and family affairs - liturgy, calendar, holidays and laws of marriage.\n\nThis is the background to the emergence of a rich and varied polemical literature in Judeo-Arabic, aimed by Jews against other faiths, and within Judaism between Karaites and Rabbanites. In fact every Karaite Halakhic or exegetical work contains extensive polemical sections.\n\nHaggai Ben-Shammai\n\n \n### Rashi: Commentary and Plain Meaning\n\n![Fig. 1: Fol.

Joseph Cohen, National and University Library, Jerusalem, [1969]). The Parma copy lacks the first leaves, and fol. [1a] begins with the comment to Genesis 3.4, \"Thou shall surely not die.\", the serpent's reply to Eve.\n\nAlthough the first dated printed edition, the work is neither the first edition of Rashi's commentary, nor the first book to be printed in Hebrew. Between 1469 and 1472 three brothers, Obadiah, Menasseh, and Benjamin of Rome, were active as the first Hebrew typographers. Six works are positively known to have come off their press, among which was the first, albeit undated edition of Rashi's commentary. Nonetheless in 1475 edition Abraham Garton created and employed, for the first time, a typeface based on a Sephardic semicursive hand. It was this same style of typeface that a few years later, when commentary and text were incorporated onto one page, would be used to distinguish Rabbinic commentary from the text proper. Ultimately, this typeface would be known as \"Rashi script.\"\n\nRabbi Solomon ben Isaac of Troyes (1040-1105, known by the acronym Rashi [Rabbi Solomon Yitzchaki]) is acknowledged as the biblical commentator par excellence of the Jewish exegetical tradition. Rashi spent his early years in Troyes and then went to the rabbinical academies of Worms and Mainz where he drew upon the classical rabbinic sources that had been transmitted from both the Babylonian (Islamic) and Palestinian (Eretz Yisrael and Byzantine) traditions.\n\nRashi wrote commentaries on the entire Hebrew Bible (except Ezra-Nehemiah, Chronicles and Job). One of his fundamental principles was to balance the lexical boundaries of the biblical words or phrases against a variety of potential interpretations from rabbinic literature. He described his approach in the following way: \"There are Many aggadic Midrashim, and our Rabbis have previously set them in proper order in Genesis Rabbah and other Midrash collections. However, I have come for the plain meaning of the biblical text and for the Aggadot that settle the words of the Scriptural text in their proper order.\" (Genesis 3:8). Rashi used the Hebrew phrase unique to his writings, Peshuto shel Miqra, to describe his goal. A discerning reader of Rashi's commentaries can observe his sensitivity to the Christian environment. The initial comment on each of the Five Books of Moses presses the argument that each book is a continuous narrative of God's affection for the Jewish people. In his commentary on the Psalter there are several references to a Teshuvah le-Minim (a response to the Christians) that refute a typological reading of the Psalter as prophesies of Jesus Christ and the Incarnation. The commentaries on the prophetic books also have indications that Rashi \"answered\" the Christians [Ezekiel 1:3], and the eschatological visions indicate his sensitivity to the suffering of the Jewish people in the exile. The biblical commentaries of Rashi influenced his immediate successors in the Northern French Jewish academies such as his younger colleague Joseph Kara, and his grandson Samuel b. Meier. In addition to his influence on the Jewish exegetical tradition, Rashi's commentaries appear to have been a source for the scholars at St. Victor Abbey in Paris such as Hugh and Andrew. Furthermore, the Franciscan Nicholas of Lyre (1270-1349) made extensive use of Rashi's commentaries and thereby influenced the work of Martin Luther and other scholars of the Reformation.\n\nMichael Signer\n\n### The Glossa Ordinaria and the Development of Layout\n\n![Fig. 1: Chapter one of Isaiah, with marginal and interlinear glossa ordinaria.

Here the commentary to Isaiah is that of the Provençal Rabbi and grammarian David Kimhi (ca. 1160-ca. 1235).\n\nGloss (Gk. glossa, Lat. glossa, tongue, speech) is an interpretation or explanation of isolated words. To gloss is to interpret or explain a text by taking up its words one after another. In Canon law, glosses are short elucidations attached to the important words in the juridical texts, which make up the collections of the \"Corpus Juris Canonici\" (q.v.). But the term gloss is also given to the ensemble of such notes in any entire collection, e. g. the Gloss of the \"Decretum\" of Gratian, of the \"Liber Sextus\", etc. These brief notes, at first inserted between the lines, soon overflowed the margins, and became copious enough to form a framework, intertextually and physically, within which the real text was enshrined, as may be seen by an examination of ancient manuscripts and certain editions of the \"Corpus Juris Canonici\". Moreover, later glosses were of such ample proportions as to become at times small commentaries containing discussions on the opinions of previous canonists. As each master added his own gloss the notes began to swell in volume; but care was always taken to indicate the particular author by placing a significant abbreviation after his gloss, thus: Hug. or H. (Huguccio); Jo. Fa. or F. (Joannes Faventinus), etc. Gradually this mass of glosses took on in the schools a permanent form, a necessary condition to its usefulness in teaching; and became a kind of secondary canonical text, less authoritative, of course, than the original, but supplying material for oral commentary. Thus arose \"ordinary gloss\" (glossa ordinaria), endowed with a certain authority. While this authority was not indeed official (as though it were actually the law on the point), it was nonetheless real. It represented not only the opinion and authority of the individual canonists and commentators who wrote it down, but also expressed the summa of current teaching at the time. This glossa ordinaria model for an authoritative chain of interpretive citations found its widest distribution and application in the genre of scriptural commentaries, either on individual books the Bible, or on the entire Scriptural corpus. These glossa ordinaria became, in fact, the chief source for teaching, preaching and studying the Bible in the middle Ages.\n\nJosef Gulka\n\n\n### Nicholas of Lyra and Rabbinic Exegesis!\n[img_18.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_18.png)\nNicholas of Lyra - Franciscan, Hebraist, and biblical exegete - turned to the Hebrew Bible and rabbinic commentaries more extensively than any other medieval Christian Bible commentator. The interpretations of \"Rabbi Salomon\" (Rashi) and other \"Hebrew doctors\" are cited on almost every page of Nicholas's Old Testament commentary and with remarkable frequency in his New Testament commentary as well.\n\nNicholas was drawn to the Hebrew text (and to rabbinic exegesis as authentic interpretation of Hebrew text) in his effort to establish a clear reading of the literal sense of the Christian Bible. Because he allowed for metaphor and multiple layers of meaning within the literal sense of Scripture, Nicholas was able to make use of a wide range of rabbinic interpretations.\n\nWhile Nicholas was quick to challenge Jewish interpretations that he believed contradicted Christian doctrine, he was just as likely to abandon longstanding Christian interpretations if he thought the Jewish approach more likely or \"reasonable.\" Drawing perhaps on a lost tradition of Rashi manuscript illustration, Nicholas frequently used figures to juxtapose Jewish and Christian exegesis on specific passages, as here in Exodus 25:10-21. Nicholas describes the arrangement of the rings, staves, and cherubim upon the ark according to Christian tradition and according to Jewish tradition as presented by Rashi. In the midst of his discussion, Nicholas interrupts himself to direct his reader's attention, saying \"so that the above said things may be understood more easily, I have described them in a drawing.\" As is often the case, the drawings help support Nicholas's contention that Rashi's interpretation is more reasonable than the traditional Christian view.\n\nDeeana Klepper\n \n### The Song of Songs in Medieval Northern France - Peshat Exegesis Against its Historical and Cultural Background\n![img_13.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_13.png)\n![img_14.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_14.png)\nThe inner Jewish religious discourse and the continuous intellectual confrontation and dialogue with Christian environment, were centered in the 12th century around exegesis of Scripture. The study of this exegesis, in its forms, methods and contents, is perhaps the best means by which the common intellectual milieu and the peculiar spiritual contexts of each of these religious communities can be understood. They are all expressions of the specific sociological and cultural setting of the 12th-13th centuries. An example of this literature are the commentaries on the Song of Songs, which was one of the most popular and most commented on biblical work throughout the ages.\n\nAmong the interesting features of the history of the Song of Song's Jewish interpretation are two, probably related phenomena: a) the emergence and flourish of Peshat exegesis which focused on the literal interpretation of the Song of Songs; b) a relatively great number of medieval \"Ashkenazi\" commentaries, the authors of which are either anonymous or conjectural.\n\nThree such commentaries are Rashbam's commentary on the Song of Songs (published by A. Jellinek in 1855), which provides a unique perspective on the Peshat school of exegesis at its climax, and two more little-known anonymous commentaries of the same provenance: a commentary published by A. H|bsch in 1866 and attributed by some scholars to Joseph Kara, and a commentary published H. J. Mathews in 1896, belonging to the same northern-France provenance of the 12th-13th centuries. These two works share a unique characteristic: they have given up the allegorical interpretation of the Song of Songs and are dedicated exclusively to the literal meaning of the work: an expression of human love.\n\nThis bold deviation from the accepted traditional stand toward the Song of Songs which - on the face of the matter - is similar to modern critical philological/historical understanding of the Song of Songs, is differently motivated and expresses a unique track of the Jewish/Christian polemic.\n\nSara Japhet\n\n \n### David Kimhi - Between Philology and Exegesis \n![img_8.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_8.png)\nAny family would be proud to produce an eminent biblical exegete; the Kimhi family produced three: Joseph (ca. 1105-1170), an emigri from al-Andalus (Muslim Spain) who settled in Narbonne in Christian Provence, and his two sons, Moses (d. ca. 1190) and David (ca. 1160-1235). Together, they formed a channel through which the exegetical streams of the Andalusian rationalist-philological tradition of peshat exegesis entered the Provengal intellectual horizon, which, in their time, was dominated by the midrashic legacy of Rabbi Moses ha-Darshan of Narbonne (early 11th century) and the Midrash-laden commentaries of Rashi (1040-1105), the great northern French Talmudist, whose works spread quickly among Jewish communities in Christian Europe. Whereas midrashic exegesis applied creative and fanciful reading methods in order to extract religious meaning from Scripture, Joseph Kimhi, aided by his elder son, Moses, began to establish in Provence a stricter methodology of biblical interpretation based, first and foremost on a philological reading of Scripture, in accordance with a venerable tradition that had developed in al-Andalus over the preceding two centuries. But David, known as Radak (Rabbi David Kimhi), the youngest and brightest star of the Kimhi constellation, would refocus the entire exegetical tradition. Born and educated in Narbonne, this illustrious scion of the Spanish peshat tradition was nourished by the midrashic soil of Provence and produced an original exegetical system that integrates elements from both schools. Radak became remarkably popular in both Jewish and Christian circles; his commentaries have appeared alongside Rashi and Abraham ibn Ezra in the Rabbinic Bible (Mikra'ot Gedolot, introduced in the sixteenth century); and he earned for his family the tribute that the rabbinic adage, \"There is no Torah without flour (kema)\", was adapted poetically as, \"There is no Torah without Kimhi\".\n\nIn accord with Kimhi tradition, Radak began his writing career around 1205 with a monumental work on biblical Hebrew language, the first part of which is a grammar, Sefer Mikhlol, the second a dictionary, Sefer ha-Shorashim. Our Provengal exegete went on to write commentaries on Chronicles, Psalms, Proverbs, Former Prophets, Latter Prophets and Genesis. Inspired by the great twelfth century Andalusian philosopher, Maimonides, Radak also composed separate esoteric philosophical commentaries on the `account of creation' (ma`aseh bereshit; Gen 2:7-5:1) and `account of the Chariot' (ma`aseh merkavah; Ezekiel 1). Although Radak wrote no separate polemical work, he addresses (and aims to refute) christological readings throughout his writings, often drawing upon Joseph Kimhi's Sefer ha-Berit, a literary record of a disputation between a Christian and Jew.\n\nFeatured here is a passage from CJS RAR MS 375, a late thirteenth-early fourteenth century manuscript of the Shorashim, which is perhaps Radak's most influential work. It quickly became standard in Jewish learning and even achieved popularity among Christian Hebraists well into the seventeenth century. (It was used, for example, by the translators of the 1611 King James Bible.) In the post-script to the Shorashim, Radak mentions that his two-part linguistic work was produced at the request of biblical scholars in Provence who found it difficult to understand \"the books of the authors who came before [which were] translated from one language to another and are difficult to understand.\" This would seem to be a reference to the great Hebrew linguist, Jonah ibn Janah, whose grammar-dictionary combination (Kitab al-Luma` and Kitab al-Usul, written in Arabic) is indeed the model of Radak's work. Although Ibn Janah's magnum opus was indeed translated into Hebrew in twelfth century Provence by Judah ibn Tibbon, evidently there was a need for a clearer Hebrew work of this type, which Radak aimed to fill.\n\nA glimpse of Radak's daily life emerges in another note in the post-script to the Shorashim, where the author apologizes to the reader for any errors that might have crept into his grammatical-linguistic work and attributes them to the fact that \"all the days that I worked on [the Mikhlol and Shorashim], most of my time was spent on my [primary] work teaching young men Talmud.\" This remark helps to explain the extensive citations of Talmud and Midrash in Radak's commentaries, a feature unusual in the peshat school our Provengal exegete inherited and would have seen, for example, in the commentaries of Abraham ibn Ezra (1089-1164), the eminent Andalusian imigri exegete who represents the \"pure\" hermeneutics of that tradition. Although Radak did indeed take ibn Ezra to be his peshat mentor, this Provengal Talmud teacher was also at home in rabbinic exegesis and evidently was moved by its creativity, depth and inspirational force. Manifesting a special talent for integration, Radak harnessed the two exegetical streams that converged in twelfth century Provence to biblical commentaries that combine linguistic acuity and historical sensitivity with interpretive creativity, imagination and religious passion. All of these qualities contribute to the lasting impact of his work to this day, especially among readers of Scripture who seek a historical-philological interpretation that does not forfeit the spiritual dimension of Holy Writ.\n\nMordechai Cohen\n\n \n### Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Polemics in Spain\n![img_6.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_6.png)\n![img_7.png](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_7.png)\nServing his Barcelona community for almost half a century, Rabbi Shelomoh ibn Adret (the \"Rashba,\" ca. 1235-1310) inherited Nahmanides' (Ramban's) mantle, whose student he was, in the latter's leading position in Spanish Jewry and was recognized as the outstanding Halakhic authority of his generation on the Iberian Peninsula and beyond. Questions were addressed to Ibn Adret from all over the Jewish world, and even the king of Aragon, Pedro III, submitted to him for adjudication a number of complicated cases that had arisen between Jews of different communities. Already Yosef Caro started to collect Ibn Adret's Responsa, which served him as a major source of his Shulhan Arukh. The more than 10,000 known Teshuvot were subsequently published in different printed editions and other collections, posing a difficult literary problem. The first collection of Ibn Adret's Responsa was published in Rome between 1469 and 1471 and the second, of which only a few copies remain, in Constantinople in 1516. The CAJS rare book room includes a Bologna print from the Jewish year (5)299, i.e. 1538 or 1539, containing 1255 Teshuvot. Moreover, most of the Responsa attributed to Nahmanides and included in the 1519 Venice print, another treasure of the CAJS library, actually are the work of Ibn Adret.\n\nIn his Responsa as in his other writings, Ibn Adret often deals with exegetical questions, thereby referring to the inner-Jewish debate about allegorization, an exegetical technique he was opposing to. Moreover, Ibn Adret shows his familiarity with the arguments of contemporary Christian polemicists against Judaism, e.g. the Dominican friar Raymond Martini (Ramsn Martm) and the Franciscan Raymond Lull (Ramsn Llull), both of whom were arguing about specific questions of how to understand the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud.\n\nA polemical treatise authored by Ibn Adret and called Ma'amar 'al Yishma'el (\"Treatise against the Muslim\") responds to the 11th-century Muslim scholar Ibn Hazm of Cordoba. Having written the fullest Bible criticism of any Muslim scholar, Ibn Hazm had claimed that the Hebrew Bible cannot be identical with the original text revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai but must be a later corruption. A closer look at Ibn Adret's response to Ibn Hazn shows that the Rabbi, when refuting classical Muslim literature, was also aiming against contemporary Christian exegesis, since he saw certain commonalities between Islamic Bible criticism and the Christian claim that the Jews had abandoned the religion of the \"Old Testament\" and replaced it by the Talmud.\n\nMartin Jacobs\n\n## Printed & Glossed Bible\n\n### Miqra'ot Gedolot - the Format is the Function\n![Fig. 1: Exodus 1, chapter 1, in the 1951 New York reprint of the Warsaw 1860-69 edition.

It is most common with texts from the Pentateuch but has been used for all the books of the Bible. The edition pictured here, originally printed in Warsaw from 1860 through 1869, is a particularly comprehensive one. It was reprinted in the middle decades of the 20th century in the United States. It includes Onkelos' Aramaic translation; the commentaries of Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Nahmanides, and Sforno; marginal Masoretic notes (Masorah Parva) and a separate, more detailed apparatus of Masoretic comments (Masorah Magna); marginal references to rabbinic literature; and Masoretic and numerological comments by Jacob b. Asher, the \"Baal ha-Turim.\"\n\nA new English-language edition of the Book of Exodus is in preparation for publication, in a format that mimics the traditional Miqra'ot Gedolot. Of the four major commentators, Sforno, from Renaissance Italy, is replaced by Rashi's grandson R. Samuel b. Meir (\"Rashbam\"), whose willingness to contradict traditional interpretation has at last put him \"on the page\" even in Miqra'ot Gedolot editions from Orthodox presses. The Aramaic translation is replaced with two English translations made under the auspices of the Jewish Publication Society, the older one more literal and the newer one more free. A digest of comments offers a glimpse at a range of commentators from Bekhor Shor (a contemporary of Rashbam) to Sforno. Explanatory notes complete the edition.\n\nMichael Carasik\n\n### Margins and Mirrors in England\n\n![Fig. 1: The Byble, that is to say all the Holy Scripture; in whych are co[n]tayned the Olde and New Testamente, truly & purely tra[n]slated into English, & nowe lately with greate industry & dilige[n]ce recognised.\n](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_9.png)![Fig. 2: The Byble, that is to say all the Holy Scripture; in whych are co[n]tayned the Olde and New Testamente, truly & purely tra[n]slated into English, & nowe lately with greate industry & dilige[n]ce recognised.\n](/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_10.png)\nFig. 1 & Fig. 2: The Byble, that is to say all the Holy Scripture; in whych are co[n]tayned the Olde and New Testamente, truly & purely tra[n]slated into English, & nowe lately with greate industry & dilige[n]ce recognised.\n\n\nAfter the Reformation, it became increasingly common for Protestants, particularly in England, to own vernacular bibles. Some translations, following the tradition of the medieval glossed bibles, had extensive notes printed in the margins. But readers often added their own notes as well. This \"Matthew\" Bible from the CJS Library is a folio, the largest format for a printed book, and was published in London in 1549 by John Day. Large bibles like this were printed for liturgical use but, given later versions and the brief reassertion of Catholicism by Mary I (1553-8), such bibles migrated into private households. This is clearly the case with this bible, in which there are notes by at least five different readers from the mid-sixteenth century to the eighteenth century.\n\nOne seventeenth- or eighteenth-century reader has marked up a passage in Isaiah 44, which has the following printed note at the top of the page: \"Christ promeseth to delyuer his churche, whiche he hath redeamed. Idolatry & knelyng before ymages .etc. are confuted.\" Such attacks upon \"idolatry\" and images were a common feature of anti-Catholic polemics. But a few pages later, the same reader has written in the margins of Isaiah 51, in mirror writing, a record of an economic transaction: \"Iohn Spencer dothe owe me xxs for halfe a yares wagys of the whyche xxs I haue receyved thre nobels.\" Such secular notes are surprisingly frequent since bibles were secure places to \"file\" information. At the same time, writing paper remained expensive and scarce until the invention of wood-pulp paper in the nineteenth century and a bible was often the only book that a household owned. Bibles were consequently used not only for exegetical purposes but also for family records, household accounts, and a variety of other notes. Children's alphabets and owners' signatures are two of the commonest forms of writing found in bibles and are frequently found in the margins as well as on the blank pages at the beginning and end.\n\nIn this copy, one reader has practiced various letters in the margins of Revelation, while another has tried to copy the capital letter \"E\" and has got as far as writing \"Ely\" beside \"Elyzabeth\" in the printed text. A third reader has twice written his signature, \"John Welster,\" in the margins. Finally, a nineteenth-century reader has inserted a newspaper cutting at Psalm 100. It reads: \"'Many persons,' says The Chambers Journal, 'must have been struck with the awkward beginning of the line in the 100th Psalm: 'For why? The Lord our God is good.'\"\n\nThe truth is, popular ingenuity - represented in this case perhaps by the printer - has taken the liberty of changing the old word, 'forwhy,' meaning 'because,' which gave good sense and translated the original, but which had fallen out of common use, into the modern 'for why?' Surely the restoration of the word might still be attempted before it is too late.\"\n\nPeter Stallybrass\n\n\n# Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Allemanno, Johanan ben Isaac.** _Hay ha-\\`olamim = L'immortale.

What defines each of these religious cultures, however, is not only their common heritage in the Biblical past but the distinctive traditions that each of them has developed for interpreting the Bible and what they believed to be its message and meaning. Indeed, it is the different ways in which they have interpreted the Bible that have decisively shaped the development of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. And all too often, perhaps, their different understandings of the Bible have also determined and complicated the tangled relations of these religious communities with each other.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Historically, the distinctive character of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Biblical interpretation is reflected not only in the substance of their exegetical traditions but equally so in the material forms through which their authors have recorded and transmitted their interpretations. These have ranged from modes of oral recitation to scrolls to books of many different kinds. In some cases, in fact, particular religious groups consciously adopted new or different material forms for transmitting their sacred Scriptures or exegetical traditions precisely in order to distinguish and differentiate themselves from each other. In other cases, the similarity of their material forms belies the oft-repeated claims of each tradition to absolute originality and uniqueness, and demonstrates, in fact, their frequent dependence and shared qualities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this virtual exhibit, Fellows of the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies share with you some examples of the different exegetical traditions they have found most intriguing, and the various material forms in which those traditions have been recorded. Participating fellows have each chosen an example, written a short description of it and picked a sample illustration to go with it. Each of these examples may be found in the library of the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies or at the main library of the University of Pennsylvania (unless otherwise noted). These examples, as you will see, trace the history of these traditions of interpretation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and their changing material forms, from the ancient period to the early modern. And while our examples are far from exhaustive - even with the endless possibilities of virtual reality, we still could not manage to include oral tradition - it is our hope that these selections will show you both the variety and commonality of Biblical interpretation that has informed the three main religious communities of Western culture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David Stern\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"exhibit\">Exhibit\u003C/h1>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"bible--inner-biblical-exegesis\">Bible &#x26; Inner Biblical Exegesis\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"facing-destruction-and-exile-inner-biblical-exegesis-in-jeremiah-and-ezekiel\">Facing Destruction and Exile: Inner-Biblical Exegesis in Jeremiah and Ezekiel\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_26.png\" alt=\"Fig. 1: Measuring only 17 cm in height, this was only the third edition of the complete Hebrew Bible, and the first to have been printed in the octavo format.

Moreover, the verses demonstrate the phenomenon of inner-biblical interpretation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Inner-biblical exegesis and allusion suggest diverse points of view about the interrelationship between texts written over a vast geographical as well as chronological span. Scholars have identified constitutive assumptions that guided biblical authors in the exertion of inner interpretation. Three of them are considered essential for both allusion and exegesis. First, deliberate literary connections relate a later-alluding text to its earlier-source text. Second, the source text is considered authoritative and valid to the present. Third, among other reasons, the motivation of the alluding text is often to accord the present disastrous reality with the theological traditional concepts and with the historical heritage.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Examining the phenomenon of interpretation, the prophets are usually held responsible for the inner interpretation. However, inner-biblical exegesis is not restricted to the prophets at all. Focusing on one social-historical setting can illuminate the evolvement of inner-biblical interpretation. Debates and disputation-speeches in the Books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel elucidate an exegetical discourse between the prophets and their audiences, quoted as “other voices” in Jerusalem and in Babylon. Coping with kernel questions of existence in face of the destruction and the exiles, the opponents rely on different types of source texts. Nevertheless, they share one of the most constructive aspects of exegesis, namely Correlation, consisting of two contrasting phases: Analogy and Polarity. Based on different lines of argumentation, each of the quotations and their prophetical refutations treat this mode of Correlation differently. Yet the motives of the speakers and the prophets are equally exegetical. Thus, inner-biblical interpretation can be traced down in non-prophetical sources as well. This reveals a multifaceted internal exegesis already within biblical texts of the first half of the sixth century BCE.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dalit Rom-Shiloni\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"king-solomon-made-him-a-palanquin-of-wood-from-lebanon--song-of-songs-39\">King Solomon made him a palanquin of wood from Lebanon … (Song of Songs 3:9)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_27.png\" alt=\"Fig. 1: King Solomon made him a palanquin of wood from Lebanon: He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple wood, within, it was decked with love by the maidens of Jerusalem. -Song of Songs: 3:9-10 (JPS Translation)\n\">\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_28.png\" alt=\"Fig. 2: King Solomon made him a palanquin of wood from Lebanon: He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple wood, within, it was decked with love by the maidens of Jerusalem. -Song of Songs: 3:9-10 (JPS Translation)\n\">\nFig. 1 &#x26; Fig. 2: \u003Cem>King Solomon made him a palanquin of wood from Lebanon: He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple wood, within, it was decked with love by the maidens of Jerusalem\u003C/em>. -Song of Songs: 3:9-10 (JPS Translation)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The third chapter of the Song of Songs, verses 9-10, describes the nuptial bed of King Solomon, known as the palanquin (Apirion). Some scholars claim that this song was composed in honor of King Solomon’s marriage to the daughter of a foreign king, possibly Pharaoh’s daughter. If this assumption is correct then this song embodies the oldest song in the book of the Song of Songs; it forms the Book’s nucleus and all the other poems were assembled and composed around it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Song of Songs Rabbah (an exegetical Midrash, that comprises sayings of sages that lived in the land of Israel, between the first and fourth century CE, although it was redacted at somewhat later period) on these verses introduces a series of five allegorical interpretations on verses 9-10. Each interpretation (Petira) represents a complete and systematic allegorical exegesis for these verses. The palanquin is used as an image to following themes: the Tabernacle, the Ark, the Temple, the Creation of the World and the Throne of Glory.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Tamar Kadari\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"syriac-biblical-exegesis\">Syriac Biblical Exegesis\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_29.png\" alt=\"img_29.png\">\nFig 1\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_30.png\" alt=\"Fig. 2: Rear cover, showing details of original binding.

Beginning in the third century at least Syriac-speaking Christians flourished in Mesopotamia. The various communities lived along the ever-changing borderlands between the Roman and Persian Empires and later between the Byzantine and Arab empires. They thrived and grew amidst the cross-cultural admixture of the late ancient Near East.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>According to tradition, Edessa and its king were converted to Christianity in the second century by Addai (Thaddeus?) one of the 70 disciples of Luke 10.1 This history is recorded in the Syriac treatise, the Doctrine of Addai. Whether this trajectory is accurate or not, the Bible was soon translated into Syriac at Edessa. The Peshitta of the Old Testament was probably first translated from the Hebrew for the Jewish community, but it eventually became standard for the Christians. The New Testament gospels circulated in several versions, one of which, the Evangelion da-Mehallate, was a homogenization of the four gospels into one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From the fourth-century onward the Christian community produced many homiletic, exegetical and liturgical works. The fourth-century produced the likes of Ephrem Syrus who was known for his lyrical poetry and extensive biblical commentaries as well as community leadership. Ephrem’s older contemporary Aphrahat the Persian Sage interpreted biblical passages in unique (among fourth-century Christians) ways. His Persian-Mesopotamian Semitic milieu, minimally influenced by the developing Greco-Roman Christian tradition, afforded Aphrahat the opportunity to innovate in his biblical readings. Yet, much of his homiletic writings reflect similar patterns in the contemporaneous rabbinic writings illuminating the cross-cultural matrices of the late ancient Near East.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Syriac writing continued to flourish into the Arab period. Yet as Arabic became the lingua franca of the Syriac Christian community in the Arab lands, Syriac was relegated mostly for liturgical uses. The page of manuscript displayed here is from an 18th century Takhsa damkurayya, a written betrothal agreement. This manuscript is written in the Nestorian hand, one of the three standard Syriac scripts.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Naomi Koltun-Fromm\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-bible-as-read-the-idea-of-election-in-the-ritual-of-scriptural-reading\">The Bible as Read: The Idea of Election in the Ritual of Scriptural Reading\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_31.png\" alt=\"img_31.png\">\nFig. 1\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_32.png\" alt=\"Fig. 2: The highlighted lines at bottom show the blessing cited in Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 11b: &#x22;who has chosen us from all peoples and given us the Torah.&#x22; The highlighted section above contains the respective blessings: &#x22;who has not made me a heathen&#x22; (goy), and &#x22;who has not made me a woman.&#x22; Both are crossed out; note that the text to the first blessing has been entirely obliterated, due to censorship.\">\nFig. 2: The highlighted lines at bottom show the blessing cited in Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 11b: “who has chosen us from all peoples and given us the Torah.” The highlighted section above contains the respective blessings: “who has not made me a heathen” (goy), and “who has not made me a woman.” Both are crossed out; note that the text to the first blessing has been entirely obliterated, due to censorship.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The blessings recited before and after the scriptural reading defines the reading as something separated from everyday life, as a ritual. In the blessing which is recited before the Torah reading, we meet the idea of the election of Israel:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has chosen us from all peoples and given us the Torah” (Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 11b)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Scholars explain that this blessing emphasizes the connection between the election of Israel and giving the Torah. The election of Israel was implemented by giving them the Torah. But why is the idea of election is mentioned here, in the context of reading the Torah in public? What role does this blessing fulfill in this specific liturgical context?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It appears that the election of Israel in the Torah blessing is connected to the “democratization” of the public reading in the rabbinic custom. In ancient sources where rituals of Torah reading are found, the reader is always a priest or the political leader. In “Hakhel” gathering, at the festival of Sukkoth after the seventh year (the Shemitah), the king is the one who reads from the Torah (Deuteronomy 31,10-13; Mishnah Sotah 7,8). In the description of the public reading in Nehemiah 8, the reader is Ezra the priest, and in the description of the Torah reading after the service of the high priest at the Day of Atonement, the reader is the high priest himself (Mishnah Yoma 7,1). The same picture rises from Philos’ description of the Torah reading on Saturdays (Hypothetica 7.12-13). Compared to that we find a very different picture in the rabbinic literature. According to the rabbinic sources every Jew (in principle) may read the Torah, not only the priest or the leader (Tosefta Megilah 3,11). It appears that the idea of election of Israel that mentioned in the Torah blessing is not an abstract theological idea. It is rather connected to the performance of scriptural reading. In order to justify the active participation of lay people in this worship, which is not trivial at all, the reader mentions in his blessing that God elected the entire people of Israel and gave them his Torah.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Adiel Kadari\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"dead-sea-scrolls\">Dead Sea Scrolls\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"lamentations-at-qumran\">Lamentations at Qumran\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_5.png\" alt=\"img_5.png\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>More interesting than the recent controversies surrounding their publication are the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves, especially what they tell us about how the Bible was used and interpreted by this Jewish community at Qumran. All the books of the Hebrew Bible except for Esther have been found among the Scrolls, most in multiple copies, and several with commentaries (pesharim). Among the most popular books were Genesis, Deuteronomy, Isaiah, and Psalms, but verses from all the books could find their way into the community’s own writings, in the form of proof texts, citations, and allusions. The allusions are a particularly subtle but effective way to make the Bible relevant to a contemporary situation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Such is the case with Lamentations, a book commemorating the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. Many verses from Lamentations were woven throughout two lament-like poems from Qumran giving voice to the community’s sense of alienation from other Jews. To the people at Qumran, Jerusalem was still destroyed (since they rejected as being corrupt the Jerusalem priesthood and worship at the Second Temple). They likened their Jewish opponents, in the war of words over biblical interpretation and religious doctrine and observance, to the Babylonians of old, who were responsible for Jerusalem’s destruction. They felt besieged, mentally and spiritually, if not physically, no less than their ancestors in 586. The people at Qumran were, in their own eyes, the true heirs of biblical Israel, and their use of the Bible reflects and supports that belief.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Adele Berlin\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"rabbinic-midrash--patristic-exegesis\">Rabbinic Midrash &#x26; Patristic Exegesis\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-mekhilta-of-rabbi-ishmael\">The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img.png\" alt=\"img.png\">\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_1.png\" alt=\"img_1.png\">\nThe \u003Cem>Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael\u003C/em> is one of the earliest midrashim, or rabbinic commentaries on the Bible, and signals the emergence of Rabbinic Judaism in the early centuries of the Common Era. Its line-by-line, even word by word, commentary on large sections of the book of Exodus makes it a literary and conceptual counterpoint and complement to the non-exegetical Mishnah. One of the key features of this midrash is its interweaving of detailed legal commentary with non-legal (or aggadic) interpretation into one cohesive work. The \u003Cem>Mekhilta,\u003C/em> like the other halakhic midrashim, presents the complexity of the rabbinic exegetical tradition, demonstrating both its unique conception of a densely significant rabbinic scripture, as well as dramatizing the forms of dialogical and dialectical thinking that become the hallmarks of rabbinic composition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In recent years scholars have revised their understanding of the place of the rabbis in the first three centuries of the Common Era. Where rabbinic texts were once assumed to represent a sort of Normative Judaism of the post Temple era, and the rabbis to be the leaders of the Jewish community living under Roman rule, we now understand the early rabbis to have been a small and decentralized “movement,” claiming few adherents outside their own limited circles. This shift in historical thinking means we need to return to these texts and read them anew. The text above is part of an introduction to the civil laws collected in the Mekhilta (Tractate Mishpatim or Nezikin) and worries about the status of rabbinic legal authority in a Roman world. It is one of the texts that invites the reader to re-imagine the group that composed this midrash to be marginal, but ambitious, asserting an exegetical authority able and willing to lead the Jewish community.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Natalie Dohrmann\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"patristics-and-portraiture-typological-interpretation\">Patristics and Portraiture?

Typological interpretation is applied primarily to the Old Testament, although types are identified in the New Testament as well. Types may be persons, objects, or patterns of events. They are regarded as antecedent to, but, in effect, retrojected from later realities which are considered their fulfillments. Types are regarded as predictive of and propaedeutic to their fulfillments, which may be evangelical, ecclesial, or eschatological. While they must have a distinct similarity to the persons, objects, events which they prefigure, a type is always an inferior approximation of a revelation to come.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dan Sheerin\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-pirke-de-rabbi-eliezer\">The Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_2.png\" alt=\"img_2.png\">\nA late Midrash that is “rewriting” the biblical events from creation to the story of the punishment of Miriam for her criticism of Moses (Num. 12).

With respect to the printed versions, the manuscripts present a wider and more complete range of texts. They also differ in that they present variants that positively link the Pesikta Rabbati to the Minhag Yerushalmi, or Minhag Erets Israel, that is, the Palestinian rite. By the thirteenth century, Palestinian Jewish communities had been assimilated into communities that followed the predominant Babylonian (“Bavli”) custom.

Jesus receives from God, “the Book, wisdom, the Torah, and the Evangelium” (5:110).

These stikhera, fixed in number, are inserted between the final verses of the fixed psalms appointed in the ordo for the daily cycle of vespers and matins. Three sets of stikhera make up the bulk of a complete Stikherarion: from the Menaion [a set of 12 books, one for each month, containing the variable hymns and text appointed for vespers and orthros of the fixed yearly cycle ]; from the Triodion [the liturgical collection containing the variable parts of the services for the moveable Lenten and Paschal cycle] and the Pentekostarion [the liturgical collection containing the appointed variable elements for the 50 day Pentecost cycle; these two separate larger collections excerpted and combined into one volume for the Stikherarion] and from the Oktoechos [a liturgical collection containing the texts for the daily cycles for every day of the year excluding Lent, arranged according to each of the eight modal cycles, or echoi].

New activity in Halakhic monographs, Biblical exegesis and religious philosophy, starts suddenly, from nothing as it were, with very little antecedents to rely on. The beginning of this new chapter is coupled with a most fundamental cultural change, namely the emergence of Judeo-Arabic culture. Jews adopted the Arabic language, indeed Arab culture, for all needs and purposes. This important change affected all areas of literary activity, both religious and secular, with the exception of liturgical poetry. As a result of this change Jews shared the same language with all other inhabitants of the political system of Islam - Muslims, Christians (a very large and conspicuous community within the boundaries of Islam) and members of other faiths. Socially it involved all segments of the Jewish population, including the highest echelons of Jewish spiritual and cultural leadership of the largest communities at the time. The importance of this change cannot be overestimated, as it brought Jewish spiritual activity in direction contact and interaction with the cultural environment at large (including Islam, Christianity and the heritage of Classical philosophy and sciences). It should be mentioned though that as a rule Judeo-Arabic (with the exception of several hundred Karaite Medieval manuscripts) is written in Hebrew script (like some more recent Jewish languages). This has constituted in some measure a cultural divide between Jews and members of other faiths. Judeo-Arabic has been used by Arabic speaking Jews until the 20th century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Geonic period witnessed also the most important development in the history of Jewish sectarianism during the Middle Ages, namely the schism between Rabbanites and Karaites. In principle the Karaites rejected (and still do to this day) the authority of the Rabbinic tradition in favor of independent interpretation of the Bible. In practical terms this led to the development of an independent system of commandments and prohibitions. The differences between them and other Jews were most evident in the areas of communal and family affairs - liturgy, calendar, holidays and laws of marriage.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is the background to the emergence of a rich and varied polemical literature in Judeo-Arabic, aimed by Jews against other faiths, and within Judaism between Karaites and Rabbanites.

Between 1469 and 1472 three brothers, Obadiah, Menasseh, and Benjamin of Rome, were active as the first Hebrew typographers. Six works are positively known to have come off their press, among which was the first, albeit undated edition of Rashi’s commentary. Nonetheless in 1475 edition Abraham Garton created and employed, for the first time, a typeface based on a Sephardic semicursive hand. It was this same style of typeface that a few years later, when commentary and text were incorporated onto one page, would be used to distinguish Rabbinic commentary from the text proper. Ultimately, this typeface would be known as “Rashi script.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac of Troyes (1040-1105, known by the acronym Rashi [Rabbi Solomon Yitzchaki]) is acknowledged as the biblical commentator par excellence of the Jewish exegetical tradition. Rashi spent his early years in Troyes and then went to the rabbinical academies of Worms and Mainz where he drew upon the classical rabbinic sources that had been transmitted from both the Babylonian (Islamic) and Palestinian (Eretz Yisrael and Byzantine) traditions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Rashi wrote commentaries on the entire Hebrew Bible (except Ezra-Nehemiah, Chronicles and Job). One of his fundamental principles was to balance the lexical boundaries of the biblical words or phrases against a variety of potential interpretations from rabbinic literature. He described his approach in the following way: “There are Many aggadic Midrashim, and our Rabbis have previously set them in proper order in Genesis Rabbah and other Midrash collections. However, I have come for the plain meaning of the biblical text and for the Aggadot that settle the words of the Scriptural text in their proper order.” (Genesis 3:8). Rashi used the Hebrew phrase unique to his writings, Peshuto shel Miqra, to describe his goal. A discerning reader of Rashi’s commentaries can observe his sensitivity to the Christian environment. The initial comment on each of the Five Books of Moses presses the argument that each book is a continuous narrative of God’s affection for the Jewish people. In his commentary on the Psalter there are several references to a Teshuvah le-Minim (a response to the Christians) that refute a typological reading of the Psalter as prophesies of Jesus Christ and the Incarnation. The commentaries on the prophetic books also have indications that Rashi “answered” the Christians [Ezekiel 1:3], and the eschatological visions indicate his sensitivity to the suffering of the Jewish people in the exile. The biblical commentaries of Rashi influenced his immediate successors in the Northern French Jewish academies such as his younger colleague Joseph Kara, and his grandson Samuel b. Meier. In addition to his influence on the Jewish exegetical tradition, Rashi’s commentaries appear to have been a source for the scholars at St. Victor Abbey in Paris such as Hugh and Andrew. Furthermore, the Franciscan Nicholas of Lyre (1270-1349) made extensive use of Rashi’s commentaries and thereby influenced the work of Martin Luther and other scholars of the Reformation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Michael Signer\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-glossa-ordinaria-and-the-development-of-layout\">The Glossa Ordinaria and the Development of Layout\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_17.png\" alt=\"Fig. 1: Chapter one of Isaiah, with marginal and interlinear glossa ordinaria.

To gloss is to interpret or explain a text by taking up its words one after another. In Canon law, glosses are short elucidations attached to the important words in the juridical texts, which make up the collections of the “Corpus Juris Canonici” (q.v.). But the term gloss is also given to the ensemble of such notes in any entire collection, e. g. the Gloss of the “Decretum” of Gratian, of the “Liber Sextus”, etc. These brief notes, at first inserted between the lines, soon overflowed the margins, and became copious enough to form a framework, intertextually and physically, within which the real text was enshrined, as may be seen by an examination of ancient manuscripts and certain editions of the “Corpus Juris Canonici”. Moreover, later glosses were of such ample proportions as to become at times small commentaries containing discussions on the opinions of previous canonists. As each master added his own gloss the notes began to swell in volume; but care was always taken to indicate the particular author by placing a significant abbreviation after his gloss, thus: Hug. or H. (Huguccio); Jo. Fa. or F. (Joannes Faventinus), etc. Gradually this mass of glosses took on in the schools a permanent form, a necessary condition to its usefulness in teaching; and became a kind of secondary canonical text, less authoritative, of course, than the original, but supplying material for oral commentary. Thus arose “ordinary gloss” (glossa ordinaria), endowed with a certain authority. While this authority was not indeed official (as though it were actually the law on the point), it was nonetheless real. It represented not only the opinion and authority of the individual canonists and commentators who wrote it down, but also expressed the summa of current teaching at the time. This glossa ordinaria model for an authoritative chain of interpretive citations found its widest distribution and application in the genre of scriptural commentaries, either on individual books the Bible, or on the entire Scriptural corpus. These glossa ordinaria became, in fact, the chief source for teaching, preaching and studying the Bible in the middle Ages.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Josef Gulka\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"nicholas-of-lyra-and-rabbinic-exegesis\">Nicholas of Lyra and Rabbinic Exegesis!\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_18.png\">img_18.png\u003C/a>\nNicholas of Lyra - Franciscan, Hebraist, and biblical exegete - turned to the Hebrew Bible and rabbinic commentaries more extensively than any other medieval Christian Bible commentator.

Nicholas describes the arrangement of the rings, staves, and cherubim upon the ark according to Christian tradition and according to Jewish tradition as presented by Rashi. In the midst of his discussion, Nicholas interrupts himself to direct his reader’s attention, saying “so that the above said things may be understood more easily, I have described them in a drawing.” As is often the case, the drawings help support Nicholas’s contention that Rashi’s interpretation is more reasonable than the traditional Christian view.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Deeana Klepper\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-song-of-songs-in-medieval-northern-france---peshat-exegesis-against-its-historical-and-cultural-background\">The Song of Songs in Medieval Northern France - Peshat Exegesis Against its Historical and Cultural Background\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_13.png\" alt=\"img_13.png\">\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_14.png\" alt=\"img_14.png\">\nThe inner Jewish religious discourse and the continuous intellectual confrontation and dialogue with Christian environment, were centered in the 12th century around exegesis of Scripture.

Together, they formed a channel through which the exegetical streams of the Andalusian rationalist-philological tradition of peshat exegesis entered the Provengal intellectual horizon, which, in their time, was dominated by the midrashic legacy of Rabbi Moses ha-Darshan of Narbonne (early 11th century) and the Midrash-laden commentaries of Rashi (1040-1105), the great northern French Talmudist, whose works spread quickly among Jewish communities in Christian Europe. Whereas midrashic exegesis applied creative and fanciful reading methods in order to extract religious meaning from Scripture, Joseph Kimhi, aided by his elder son, Moses, began to establish in Provence a stricter methodology of biblical interpretation based, first and foremost on a philological reading of Scripture, in accordance with a venerable tradition that had developed in al-Andalus over the preceding two centuries. But David, known as Radak (Rabbi David Kimhi), the youngest and brightest star of the Kimhi constellation, would refocus the entire exegetical tradition. Born and educated in Narbonne, this illustrious scion of the Spanish peshat tradition was nourished by the midrashic soil of Provence and produced an original exegetical system that integrates elements from both schools. Radak became remarkably popular in both Jewish and Christian circles; his commentaries have appeared alongside Rashi and Abraham ibn Ezra in the Rabbinic Bible (Mikra’ot Gedolot, introduced in the sixteenth century); and he earned for his family the tribute that the rabbinic adage, “There is no Torah without flour (kema)”, was adapted poetically as, “There is no Torah without Kimhi”.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In accord with Kimhi tradition, Radak began his writing career around 1205 with a monumental work on biblical Hebrew language, the first part of which is a grammar, Sefer Mikhlol, the second a dictionary, Sefer ha-Shorashim. Our Provengal exegete went on to write commentaries on Chronicles, Psalms, Proverbs, Former Prophets, Latter Prophets and Genesis. Inspired by the great twelfth century Andalusian philosopher, Maimonides, Radak also composed separate esoteric philosophical commentaries on the \u003Ccode dir=\"auto\">account of creation' (ma\u003C/code>aseh bereshit; Gen 2:7-5:1) and \u003Ccode dir=\"auto\">account of the Chariot' (ma\u003C/code>aseh merkavah; Ezekiel 1). Although Radak wrote no separate polemical work, he addresses (and aims to refute) christological readings throughout his writings, often drawing upon Joseph Kimhi’s Sefer ha-Berit, a literary record of a disputation between a Christian and Jew.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Featured here is a passage from CJS RAR MS 375, a late thirteenth-early fourteenth century manuscript of the Shorashim, which is perhaps Radak’s most influential work. It quickly became standard in Jewish learning and even achieved popularity among Christian Hebraists well into the seventeenth century. (It was used, for example, by the translators of the 1611 King James Bible.) In the post-script to the Shorashim, Radak mentions that his two-part linguistic work was produced at the request of biblical scholars in Provence who found it difficult to understand “the books of the authors who came before [which were] translated from one language to another and are difficult to understand.” This would seem to be a reference to the great Hebrew linguist, Jonah ibn Janah, whose grammar-dictionary combination (Kitab al-Luma` and Kitab al-Usul, written in Arabic) is indeed the model of Radak’s work. Although Ibn Janah’s magnum opus was indeed translated into Hebrew in twelfth century Provence by Judah ibn Tibbon, evidently there was a need for a clearer Hebrew work of this type, which Radak aimed to fill.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A glimpse of Radak’s daily life emerges in another note in the post-script to the Shorashim, where the author apologizes to the reader for any errors that might have crept into his grammatical-linguistic work and attributes them to the fact that “all the days that I worked on [the Mikhlol and Shorashim], most of my time was spent on my [primary] work teaching young men Talmud.” This remark helps to explain the extensive citations of Talmud and Midrash in Radak’s commentaries, a feature unusual in the peshat school our Provengal exegete inherited and would have seen, for example, in the commentaries of Abraham ibn Ezra (1089-1164), the eminent Andalusian imigri exegete who represents the “pure” hermeneutics of that tradition. Although Radak did indeed take ibn Ezra to be his peshat mentor, this Provengal Talmud teacher was also at home in rabbinic exegesis and evidently was moved by its creativity, depth and inspirational force. Manifesting a special talent for integration, Radak harnessed the two exegetical streams that converged in twelfth century Provence to biblical commentaries that combine linguistic acuity and historical sensitivity with interpretive creativity, imagination and religious passion. All of these qualities contribute to the lasting impact of his work to this day, especially among readers of Scripture who seek a historical-philological interpretation that does not forfeit the spiritual dimension of Holy Writ.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Mordechai Cohen\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"jewish-christian-and-islamic-polemics-in-spain\">Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Polemics in Spain\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_6.png\" alt=\"img_6.png\">\n\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_7.png\" alt=\"img_7.png\">\nServing his Barcelona community for almost half a century, Rabbi Shelomoh ibn Adret (the “Rashba,” ca. 1235-1310) inherited Nahmanides’ (Ramban’s) mantle, whose student he was, in the latter’s leading position in Spanish Jewry and was recognized as the outstanding Halakhic authority of his generation on the Iberian Peninsula and beyond. Questions were addressed to Ibn Adret from all over the Jewish world, and even the king of Aragon, Pedro III, submitted to him for adjudication a number of complicated cases that had arisen between Jews of different communities. Already Yosef Caro started to collect Ibn Adret’s Responsa, which served him as a major source of his Shulhan Arukh. The more than 10,000 known Teshuvot were subsequently published in different printed editions and other collections, posing a difficult literary problem. The first collection of Ibn Adret’s Responsa was published in Rome between 1469 and 1471 and the second, of which only a few copies remain, in Constantinople in 1516. The CAJS rare book room includes a Bologna print from the Jewish year (5)299, i.e. 1538 or 1539, containing 1255 Teshuvot. Moreover, most of the Responsa attributed to Nahmanides and included in the 1519 Venice print, another treasure of the CAJS library, actually are the work of Ibn Adret.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In his Responsa as in his other writings, Ibn Adret often deals with exegetical questions, thereby referring to the inner-Jewish debate about allegorization, an exegetical technique he was opposing to. Moreover, Ibn Adret shows his familiarity with the arguments of contemporary Christian polemicists against Judaism, e.g. the Dominican friar Raymond Martini (Ramsn Martm) and the Franciscan Raymond Lull (Ramsn Llull), both of whom were arguing about specific questions of how to understand the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A polemical treatise authored by Ibn Adret and called Ma’amar ‘al Yishma’el (“Treatise against the Muslim”) responds to the 11th-century Muslim scholar Ibn Hazm of Cordoba. Having written the fullest Bible criticism of any Muslim scholar, Ibn Hazm had claimed that the Hebrew Bible cannot be identical with the original text revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai but must be a later corruption. A closer look at Ibn Adret’s response to Ibn Hazn shows that the Rabbi, when refuting classical Muslim literature, was also aiming against contemporary Christian exegesis, since he saw certain commonalities between Islamic Bible criticism and the Christian claim that the Jews had abandoned the religion of the “Old Testament” and replaced it by the Talmud.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Martin Jacobs\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"printed--glossed-bible\">Printed &#x26; Glossed Bible\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"miqraot-gedolot---the-format-is-the-function\">Miqra’ot Gedolot - the Format is the Function\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/legacyexhibits/assets/images/AndWehaveRevealedtoYou/img_11.png\" alt=\"Fig. 1: Exodus 1, chapter 1, in the 1951 New York reprint of the Warsaw 1860-69 edition.

Meir (“Rashbam”), whose willingness to contradict traditional interpretation has at last put him “on the page” even in Miqra’ot Gedolot editions from Orthodox presses. The Aramaic translation is replaced with two English translations made under the auspices of the Jewish Publication Society, the older one more literal and the newer one more free. A digest of comments offers a glimpse at a range of commentators from Bekhor Shor (a contemporary of Rashbam) to Sforno.

Some translations, following the tradition of the medieval glossed bibles, had extensive notes printed in the margins. But readers often added their own notes as well. This “Matthew” Bible from the CJS Library is a folio, the largest format for a printed book, and was published in London in 1549 by John Day. Large bibles like this were printed for liturgical use but, given later versions and the brief reassertion of Catholicism by Mary I (1553-8), such bibles migrated into private households. This is clearly the case with this bible, in which there are notes by at least five different readers from the mid-sixteenth century to the eighteenth century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One seventeenth- or eighteenth-century reader has marked up a passage in Isaiah 44, which has the following printed note at the top of the page: “Christ promeseth to delyuer his churche, whiche he hath redeamed. Idolatry &#x26; knelyng before ymages .etc. are confuted.” Such attacks upon “idolatry” and images were a common feature of anti-Catholic polemics. But a few pages later, the same reader has written in the margins of Isaiah 51, in mirror writing, a record of an economic transaction: “Iohn Spencer dothe owe me xxs for halfe a yares wagys of the whyche xxs I haue receyved thre nobels.” Such secular notes are surprisingly frequent since bibles were secure places to “file” information. At the same time, writing paper remained expensive and scarce until the invention of wood-pulp paper in the nineteenth century and a bible was often the only book that a household owned. Bibles were consequently used not only for exegetical purposes but also for family records, household accounts, and a variety of other notes. Children’s alphabets and owners’ signatures are two of the commonest forms of writing found in bibles and are frequently found in the margins as well as on the blank pages at the beginning and end.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this copy, one reader has practiced various letters in the margins of Revelation, while another has tried to copy the capital letter “E” and has got as far as writing “Ely” beside “Elyzabeth” in the printed text. A third reader has twice written his signature, “John Welster,” in the margins. Finally, a nineteenth-century reader has inserted a newspaper cutting at Psalm 100. It reads: “‘Many persons,’ says The Chambers Journal, ‘must have been struck with the awkward beginning of the line in the 100th Psalm: ‘For why? The Lord our God is good.’”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The truth is, popular ingenuity - represented in this case perhaps by the printer - has taken the liberty of changing the old word, ‘forwhy,’ meaning ‘because,’ which gave good sense and translated the original, but which had fallen out of common use, into the modern ‘for why?’ Surely the restoration of the word might still be attempted before it is too late.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Peter Stallybrass\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"selected-bibliography\">Selected Bibliography\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Allemanno, Johanan ben Isaac.\u003C/strong> \u003Cem>Hay ha-`olamim = L’immortale.

From among the ranks of East European Jews emerged many of the key religious, intellectual, artistic, and political currents that shaped Jewish life across the modern period. Over the course of the last two decades, the historic Jewish communities that once covered the broad swathe of territory between the Baltic and the Black Seas have moved to the center of the study of the modern Jewish experience. Fueled by unprecedented access to long-hidden archival riches in the former Soviet bloc, a new generation of scholars has carved out fresh questions and new arenas of inquiry.\n\nThis year's CAJS seminar explored a wide range of issues relating to the history and culture of East European Jewry. We studied the relationship between the elite and the popular, the Jewish and the Slavic, the literary and the historical. We scrutinized representations of the Jewish past and the Jewish self as well as the genealogy of our own enterprise, the rich legacy of reflection on Jewish Eastern Europe from the early modern to the post-Holocaust periods.\n\nThe documents presented in the exhibit that follows faithfully reproduce the breadth of curiosity of this year's fellows. We hope you enjoy it.\n\n**Benjamin Nathans, University of Pennsylvania**\n\n## Exhibit\n\n### Rabbis or Noblemen? The Transformation of the Polish Rabbinate in the Early Modern Period\n\nAdam Teller\n\nכי בעו\"ה הנסמכים מרובים והיודעים מועטים ונזוחי הדעת נתרבו. שאין אחד מכיר מקומו. ומיד כשהוא נסמך מתחיל להשתרר ולקבץ בחורים בהון עתק כדרך השרים ששוכרים עבדים לרוץ לפניהם׃   \nים של שלמה, פרק ח נ\"ח\n\n> (\"Because, for our sins, the ordained are many but the learned few, and the ignorant are growing numerous; not one of them knows his place and as soon as he is ordained he begins to act like a lord and collect students at great expense, as do the noble officials who hire servants to run ahead of them.\" Yam shel Shlomo 8:58)\n\nThis is a section from the massive Halakhic compendium, _Yam shel Shlomo_, composed in the 16th century by the leading Polish rabbi, Shlomo Luria (c.1510-1573). In this part, which deals with the laws concerning what to do with those who fail to honor rabbis, Luria gives his opinion of the rabbinate in his day. Though its critical tone may be an expression of his well-known intellectual elitism, it draws an interesting comparison between the status of the rabbi in Jewish society and that of the nobleman in Polish society. In these years, Jewish society in Poland was refashioning the Ashkenazic rabbinate along Polish lines. The role played by the rabbis on behalf of the non-Jewish authorities in the administration of the Jewish communities led to the rabbinate taking on something of the character of the semi-honorific administrative posts like the _Wojewoda_ or the _Starosta_, held by members of the high Polish nobility. This process of deprofessionalizing the rabbinate, whose early stages are here criticized by Luria, would eventually lead to a steep decline in the status of the rabbi in Polish Jewish life at the end of the 18th century.\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/teller.jpg)![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/teller1.jpg)![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/teller2.jpg)\n\n### Who is Obligated to Wear Tzitzit\n\nMoshe Rosman\n\nSection 17 of the Shulhan Arukh, Orah Haim is entitled: \"Who is Obligated \\[to Wear\\] Tzitzit?\" The second paragraph, written by Joseph Karo in Safed in the mid-sixteenth century, reads: \"Women and slaves are exempt because it is a time-conditioned positive commandment.\" On this ruling, R. Moses Isserles (in Cracow ca. 1570) glossed: \n\n> \"In any case, if they want to wear \\[a _tallit_ \\] and make the blessing over it, they may as with all other time-conditioned positive commandments; however, it appears to be arrogance \\[_yohara_ \\] (see Tosefot, Ro\"sh and Ra\"n on chapter two of TB Rosh ha-Shana and chapter one of TB Kiddushin), and therefore they should not wear tzitzit, since \\[in any case\\] it is not a personal obligation \\[_hovat gavra_ \\] (see Agur section 27)\".\n\nLike all known societies, traditional Jewish society in Poland assigned differential tasks, manners and responsibilities to the two sexes. Just how essential this [gender definition](/web/20200125182338/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/tradition-and-its-discontents?tab=bibliography) was held to be is evident in the comment of Rabbi Moses Isserles (Cracow, 16c.), cited above, with regard to the permissibility of Jewish women ritually donning a garment with _tzitzit_ (i.e. a _tallit_ ). In this passage R. Isserles noted that wearing of _tzitzit_ by women was permissible by technical halakhic standards. Despite this technical permissibility, however, echoing earlier authorities he ruled that women should not wear _tzitzit_ because it betrayed _yohara_ (arrogance) on their part.\n\nComparison of the use of the term _yohara_ in other sixteenth century texts (e.g. J. Karo, Bet Yosef, Orah Haim 3:1, 24:2, 34:3, 90:24-25, quoting earlier sources), demonstrates that the term, as used here, probably connotes a person's aspiring to an inappropriate status. R. Isserles' appears to be saying that women who wear _tzitzit_ are trying to attain the status of men, a status that does not properly accrue to them. They are violating the gender boundary, a prohibition so basic, so taken for granted (and perhaps therefore unstated in classic rabbinic literature), that it overrides the technical permissibility of female _tzitzit_ wearing.\n\nR. Isserles was implying that _tzitzit_ were an important symbol of maleness and must remain so. Living in a society where reality made gender definition somewhat unstable, particularly in the economic sphere, this keeper of culture insisted that symbolic gender boundary markers remain firmly in place.\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/rosman.jpg)![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/rosman1.jpg)![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/rosman_detail1.jpg)![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/rosman_detail.jpg)\n\n### Jewish political culture between East and West: Isaak Ruelf and the Transformations of intercession (_shtadlanut_) in the 19th century\n\nFrançois Guesnet\n\nDr. Isaak Ruelf (1830-1902), the rabbi of Memel, a town on the Prussian-Russian border, shown an illustration for the Warsaw based journal _Kneset Israel_ (vol. I, 1886, ill. 1), edited by the pioneer of Hibat Tsion, Shaul Pinhas Rabinovitch (SheFeR), photographed shortly before Ruelf's death for _Die Welt_ in Vienna (ill. 2). Ruelf gained an international reputation as a helper of Russian Jews beginning with his relief actions in the late 1860s. Thereafter, he strove to establish himself as expert on Eastern European Jewry and as a spokesman and intercessor (_shtadlan_) on their behalf. He used the press and public opinion as leverage for this activity, the most important change during the 19th century in the tactics of intercession. Following the anti-jewish violence in 1881/82 in Russia, he conceived of Palestine as the location for a future Jewish state that would be one of the safe havens of Russian Jewry. He thus was one of the precursors of political Zionism. As such, he was honored with one of the first portraits to be published in the (_Kneset Israel_). It is evident that the illustrator tended to 'orientalise' this Prussian rabbi. In contrast, he appears in his photograph dressed very much like a typical (_dajtsh_ (or German). As Ruelf himself took advantage in his writings of stereotypes about Jews and Gentiles in Eastern Europe, he saw himself stereotyped for the needs of early Zionism in Eastern Europe.\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/guesnet.jpg)![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/guesnet_2.jpg)\n\n### Pale of Settlement and Movement\n\nBenjamin Nathans\n\nAn internal Russian passport dating from the 1880s, with the imprimatur of tsar Alexander III, granting permission for 26-year-old Shlomo Khaiklein to travel for six months throughout the Russian Empire. A native of Volozhin (Vilna guberniia), Khaiklein qualified for this privilege as a member of an artisan guild.\n\nThe vast majority of Russia's Jews were confined by law to the Pale of Settlement, a territory roughly the size of France, at the western periphery of the Russian Empire. State-sponsored restrictions on Jewish residence, a technique common to early modern European countries, persisted in Russia until the revolution of February 1917. By the 1880s, however, a series of laws made it possible for substantial numbers of Jews whom the government regarded as \"useful\" - veterans of Nicholas I's army, merchants of the first guild, certain kinds of artisans, graduates of institutions of higher education - to live and work outside the Pale on a permanent basis. By the end of the 19th century, more than 300,000 such Jews lived legally outside the Pale.\n\nWhether Shlomo Khaiklein sought temporary residence outside the Pale, or permanent settlement in the Russian interior, he was one of hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews on the move during the second half of the nineteenth century. The stereotype of backwardness and immobility of the shtetl is belied by the reality of massive Jewish migration both within the Pale, typically to urban centers such as Bialystok and Odessa, and beyond it - to Russia proper, to Palestine, and to North America. ![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/nathans.jpg)\n\n### \"Don't spit in the well you drink from!\"\n\nJohn D. Klier\n\nThis illustration first appeared in the Russian-language illustrated magazine _Gusli_ (_The Lyre_), published in Tiflis (Tbilisi) in 1881. It refers to anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia that had recently broken-out From this set of events comes the now well-established historiographical concept of the \"crisis of 1881-2\", and its role as the \"turning point in modern Jewish history\".\n\nThe cartoon illustrates the theme, much discussed at the time, of the responsibility of the Russian press for provoking the pogroms. There was, in fact, no sustained press campaign accusing the Jews of having \"murdered the tsar.\" Few newspapers focused on Gesia Gel'fman, the sole Jewish member of the terrorist group of \"The People's Will\" who assassinated Emperor Alexander II on 1 March 1881 (Old Style).\n\nOn the other hand, a number of newspapers had been very energetic in attacking Russian Jewry for a long catalogue of sins, the most important of which was that of \"exploiting the peasantry.\" Thus, when the pogroms broke out, it was easy to make the connection, as the artist does here. Many contemporary Jewish spokesmen would also have applauded his choice of papers, since these were the very ones that they had denounced to the authorities for stirring up popular passions against the Jews.\n\nThe cartoon, captioned with the Russian proverb, \"Don't spit in the well you drink from!\" reads from left to right. In the first scene, two well-known Russian publishers are driving two bemused Jews out of Russia. The publisher on the left is Ivan Aksakov, who carries a stick with a copy of his newspaper, _Rus'_, which was the name of the ancient Russia state. Aksakov, and his family, were associated with a movement known as the Slavophiles. The movement viewed with skepticism plans to westernize Russia, seeing the virtues of the country to lie in its old traditions. One of the symbols of westernization was Jewish emancipation, and Aksakov was well-known for opposing the grant of full rights to Russian Jews. _Rus'_, published in Moscow, had a very small circulation, and was almost entirely written by Aksakov himself, in a high-toned, intellectual style. It was a paper that few people bought, but everybody talked about.\n\nNext to Aksakov is A. S. Suvorin, one of the publishing geniuses of late imperial Russia. Suvorin took a small, liberal newspaper, _Novoe vremia_ (New Times) and took it \"downmarket\" to create one of the most popular newspapers in the Empire. It was the antithesis of _Rus'_ : filled with gossip, scandal and racy reporting. (The paper's reputation was established by its on-the-scene reporting of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-8.) The paper published many of Russia's greatest writers (including Anton Chekov, who didn't much care for Suvorin's Jew-baiting.) Suvorin quickly discovered that blaming the Jews for Russia's problems (such as difficulties with the supply of the Russian army in 1877 by Jewish contractors) was popular with his readers. _Novoe vremia_ attacked the Jews in a jocular, sarcastic tone, very unlike the rather pompous pronouncements of Aksakov. _Novoe vremia_, published in St Petersburg, was circulated throughout the Empire, so its Judeophobia was well-known and appreciated. Cheering on Aksakov and Suvorin are a group of Russian merchants (identifiable by their very distinctive garb). They clearly believe that, with the Jews driven out of Russia, their business will benefit.\n\nScene two shows a very different outcome. Masses of Jews are leaving the country, clutching their meager possessions left after the riots, and heading for Palestine or America. In the background a gigantic figure looms, marked \"Trade-Commercial Crisis\". The merchants, in great distress, try to restrain the departing Jews. The drawing takes note of the fall in Russian securities on world financial markets as a result of the pogroms, as well as the collapse of the regional economy in Ukraine, where the annual trade fairs, filled with Jews importing goods from Moscow, were cancelled or postponed.\n\nQuite appropriately the drawing is sub-titled \"A Tragi-Comedy in Two Pictures.\" The drawing is especially interesting because there are very few cartoons devoted to the impact of the pogroms (except for the topic of emigration, which was very popular with cartoonists).\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/klier.jpg)\n\n### Ojczyzna\n\nRachel Manekin\n\nThe cover of the first pro-Polish Jewish newspapers in Galicia. The papers appeared bi-monthly as a joint venture but under two separate editorial boards. The Hebrew paper, המזכיר אהבה לארץ מולדת (\"The Recorder of Love for One's Homeland\"), appeared between 1881 and 1886, and the Polish paper, _Ojczyzna_ (\"Fatherland\") between 1881 and 1892. In 1882 both papers became the organs of the Agudas Achim society.\n\nThe newspapers adopted as their symbol an eagle, the emblem of Poland, with a star of David drawn across its chest, to show the close connection between the two nations. Inside the Star of David one can see the letters 'W'W, short for the Polish King Kazimierz the Great, who was considered by Jews as their protector.\n\nUnder the title appeared in Hebrew and in Polish the famous verse from Jeremiah _Seek the peace of the city to which I have exiled you. And pray on its behalf to the Lord. For in its peace shall you have peace_ (29:7). Both newspapers are rare and the only place where all the volumes can be found is the University of L'viv in the Ukraine.\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/manekin.jpg)![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/manekin2.jpg)\n\n### The Ritual Murder Trial in Modern Jewish History: What is New?\n\nHillel J.

Acquitted at end of 10 day trial in 1892.\n    \n*   Polná, Austria-Hungary (Bohemia), 1899-1900. Leopold Hilsner accused of the aggravated ritual murder of 19 year old Anežka Hrůzová. Convicted and sentenced to death in 1899; at retrial in PC-sek in 1900, convicted a second time (this time for two murders) and again sentenced to death. Death sentence commuted by the Emperor to life imprisonment.\n    \n*   Konitz (Chojnice), Germany (West Prussia; Poland), 1900-01. Involved the murder and dismemberment of an 18 year old gymnasium student, Ernst Winter. Rumors were rampant that he had been the victim of a ritual murder. Moritz Lewy, a Jewish butcher, went on trial in February 1901 and was convicted, not of murder, but of perjury.\n    \n*   Beilis, Russia (Kiev, Ukraine), 1911-13. Mendel Beilis accused of ritually murdering a local boy, Andrei Iushchinskii. Beilis was acquitted, but, in issuing the verdict, the jury allowed for the possibility that a ritual murder had taken place.\n    \n\nThe success of the \"ritual murder\" trials against Jews in modern East Central Europe depended, not on their divergence from modern rationality (and even modern scientific discourses), but by virtue of their intersection with them. The story of the modern \"ritual murder\" trial, then, is not only one of the lasting power of myth and traditional wisdom but, more crucially, a tale of the momentary alliance of high culture and scientific authority with a certain perception of collective Jewish criminality.\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/safran.jpg)\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/safran2.jpg)\n\n### S. An-sky (Shloyme-Zanvl Rapoport 1863-1920\n\nGabriella Safran\n\nThese illustrations appear in a book that has had a complex fate. S. An-sky, born Shloyme-Zanvl Rapoport (1863-1920), was a Russian-Jewish writer, a pioneering ethnographer, and a dedicated revolutionary; he is known best today as the author of the play _The Dybbuk_. He spent much of 1918 preparing an edition of images that he had gathered during the ethnographic expeditions that he led to the Jewish communities of Volhynia and Podolia during the summers of 1912-1914. But as a Socialist Revolutionary who had been part of the Constituent Assembly elected after the February Revolution of 1917, An-sky feared for his safety under the Bolsheviks, the victors of the October Revolution. In the fall of 1918, he fled to Vilna, leaving most of his papers behind. The proofs of the \"Album of Jewish Artistic Artifacts\" were believed lost until, like many of his other manuscripts, they turned up in the 1990s in formerly Soviet archives. _The Jewish Artistic Heritage Album by Semyon An-sky_, published in Moscow in 2001 in Russian and English, includes all the plates that were found at the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine, along with two essays based on these and other recently rediscovered archival materials.\n\nThese two pictures reveal the man and his work. The photo shows him at 56 or 57, in the last year of his life, ill with diabetes and heart disease but retaining his famed energy for community work and writing. The colored image, one of the plates from the album, is a \"lubok\" or folk print that was produced in the second half of the nineteenth century in what is today Ukraine. The writing on the picture, in a mix of Yiddish and Hebrew, identifies the scene: \"How Rebecca gives the camels drink and Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, kneels and honors God, Blessed be He (Vi Rivke poit di gamolim un Eliezer eved Avrom knit un loybt tsu got borukh ha-shem).\" In his own edition, An-sky had intended to publish this image with a discussion of the Yiddish word used for Rebecca's action, \"poit,\" which is obviously of Eastern Slavic origin; the same word is used in Russian to this day to mean \"to give to drink.\" The attention he gives to this linguistic detail illustrates An-sky's sensitivity to the interaction both between languages and between nations or ethnic groups. Even though we associate him with the play he set in an exclusively Jewish world, all of An-sky's texts - including, as recent scholarship and new archival evidence shows, _The Dybbuk_ - emerged from a vision of Jewish folk culture and Jews themselves as existing in a state of constant, dynamic exchange with other peoples and other cultures. ![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/safran.jpg)\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/safran2.jpg)\n\n### Between Austria and Galicia: Jewish Nationalism and Diversity\n\nJoshua Shanes\n\nIn 1907, Austria held its first parliamentary elections based on universal manhood suffrage. Jewish nationalists, electrified by the prospect of winning parliamentary mandates, decided to enter the electoral campaign full-force. Jewish nationalists nominated candidates in nearly every district with significant Jewish settlement, even if they had no realistic chance of winning. Although they certainly hoped to win election in districts with large Jewish majorities, their primary purpose was to use the electoral campaign as a means of engaging Galician Jews in the political process. Jewish nationalists held hundreds of rallies in large and small communities throughout the entire province at which their best orators tried to convince Jews that they too constituted a nationality to which national minority rights were due.\n\nAside from the actual content of the speeches, the rallies themselves served as a critical agent in forging a common sense of national community among Galician Jews. Rallies attracted Jews from all classes, men and women, young and old, religious and secular. All stood together and often intermixed (by all of those criteria) as they listened to speeches calling for Jewish solidarity and national struggle. [This photograph of a mass rally in Buczacz](/web/20200125182338/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/tradition-and-its-discontents/between-austria-and-galicia-jewish?item=0) for the Jewish nationalist candidate Nathan Birnbaum (standing in front row center), for example, shows men and women of clearly middle-class dress, women with uncovered hair and shaved men with \"German\"-style hats, standing and sitting together with Jews of an obviously much lower social class, many of whom covered their hair (among the women) or wore long beards. Where else would such Jews stand together? Where else would women with children stand among men, as many do in this picture?\n\nThe Jewish National Party succeeded in winning four seats to parliament in 1907, and as promised they constituted the first Jewish nationalist parliamentary faction in Austrian history. The more important result of the election, however, was its contribution towards the transformation of Jewish identity, which by 1914 had become decidedly nationalist among Galician Jews, despite the relatively small size of the Zionist party itself. ![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/shanes.jpg)\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/shanes_d.jpg)\n\n### The Recognition of the Yiddish language in Lithuania during the First World War\n\nMarcos Silber\n\nThe entering of the German army to the territories brought about the elimination of Russian as societal language and culture. The German authorities published its announcements in some of the local vernaculars, including Yiddish. Official translations of regulations and regulatory texts were produced in several vernaculars, including Yiddish. This bureaucratic measure was interpreted as a great victory of the Jewish national movement and a sign of the integration of the Jews as individuals as well as collective equals in the public arena.\n\nHowever, this translation was not authoritative since only the German version was recognized as authentic. The vernaculars were not recognized as a means used to apply to the authorities. The fallacy of this measure was given away when it was impossible to avail oneself of the protection of the vernacular version during a legal proceeding.\n\nThe bureaucratic documentation necessary to control the native population was printed in the different vernaculars b for the easier understanding of the natives. Official forms, personal ID, and so on appeared in Yiddish as in Polish or Lithuanian. When Rachmilewitsch, Rosenbaum and Rubinstein, the most outstanding pro-German Jewish leaders in Vilnius complained in 1917 that the Ost-mark bill felt Yiddish translation and asked for it, the authorities tended to accept the request. Their answer is very revealing and is paradigmatic concerning the German formal recognition of the minorities during the first two years of occupation: \"doubtlessly we could promise the implementation of national demands lacking importance, like printing Hebrew letters on the \\[ostmark\\] notes\". After such an answer it is not surprising that these leaders never asked again for such symbolic signs. Over and over again, it became clear that the pattern established was that of constituting a unidirectional way of communication, from up down, between the government and the subject.\n\nThe politics regarding the recognition of the different minorities was in the best case, formal. It lacked any operative meaning. The importance of the minority rights didn't mean in the case presented here protection of the minority cultures; on the contrary, the recognition of the local vernaculars was a tool to disempower the minorities, a mean to achieve German hegemony and dominance over these lands.\n\nBut, this formal recognition had its own dynamics. In Jewish political circles the German policy generated meticulous examination of the practical aspects of topics, whether social or economic, considered cardinal to the Jewish minority, when this leadership negotiated with the Lithuanian leadership in the eve of the establishment of Lithuania as an independent State. ![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/silber.jpg)\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/silber2.jpg)\n\n### El Lissitzky\n\nKenneth Moss\n\nIn the years between 1917 and 1921, as Eastern Europe was wracked by war and transformed by national and social revolution, elements of the East European Jewish intelligentsia sought to carry out ambitious and competing programs of ideological, institutional, and aesthetic revolution in the Jewish cultural sphere and the arts. This striking image stems from that moment: it is a cover page by the Russian-Jewish modernist artist El Lissitzky to a translation of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales by the Yiddish modernist writer Der Nister, published in Kiev in 1919 by the literary publisher the Kiever Farlag under the auspices of the Yiddishist cultural organization the Kultur-Lige. Each of these isolated facts captures one of the most notable features of this endeavor.\n\n**1\\. The art itself:** The experimentation and excitement represented by this Constructivist illustration reflects a larger moment in the Jewish visual arts which emerged unexpectedly and just as quickly faded away: a burst of creative, experimental visual modernism by dozens of East European Jewish artists from Lissitzky in Moscow and Kiev to Natan Alt'man in Moscow to Marc Chagall in Vitebsk to Yosef Tshaikov in Kiev to Henryk Berlewi in Lodz and Warsaw. Pursuing their own individual and shifting aesthetic visions, these artists self-consciously engaged in a collective effort to work out a Jewish mode within European modernism and even a distinct Jewish modernist aesthetics.\n\n**2\\. Lissitzky and the fact of his involvement in this book project:** Artists of Jewish origin had long been part of Europe's metropolitan art scenes, including the Russian and Polish art academies. Some had explored Jewish themes and their own Jewish identities, but had done so within the framework of the metropolitan art-world of which they were a part. The revolutionary period saw a dramatically different development: the intensive involvement and identification of such artists in a larger effort by Jewish nationalist intellectuals and cultural producers to create a full-fledged Jewish aesthetic culture centering around Yiddish or Hebrew but encompassing all the arts. Producing illustrations for the flood of Yiddish and Hebrew books, journals, and children's books like this one was one of the key expressions of this involvement; these artists also produced extraordinary set designs for Hebrew and Yiddish modernist theaters springing up in Moscow, Kiev, and elsewhere, and many also exhibited at specially organized exhibitions of Jewish art and involve themselves in specially organized Jewish art studios, especially in Kiev. For many artists like Lissitzky, this identification was short-lived, lasting not more than two or three years. The brevity of their involvement demonstrates the difficulty and perhaps impossibilities of creating a full-fledged Jewish secular national culture in the diaspora; the depth and intensity of their involvement demonstrates the power and attractiveness of the idea at this historical juncture.\n\n**3\\. The text being illustrated, the significance of the choice of this text, and the nature of the translation:**   \nHistorians of modern Jewish culture tend to lay heavy emphasis on the way in which modern cultural producers reinterpreted \"authentically Jewish\" sources ranging from the Bible to the aggadah to East European Jewish folklore. We can see these strategies in Lissitzky's illustration, which adapts formal motifs from Jewish folk art and, as the historian Chimen Abramsky notes, signs his initials (bottom right) \"in a manner taken directly from medieval Ashkenazi Hebrew manuscripts.\" However, when it comes to the book itself, it is a different story. Especially in the period in question and especially with regard to literary texts like this one, these emphases miss the point in some important respects. The choice by Der Nister, a leading Yiddish symbolist, to translate the quite bun-Jewish' Hans Christian Andersen for Jewish children was not a fluke or an idiosyncratic decision, but represents rather a strategy of Jewish cultural development no less important for the nationalist intelligentsia in this period than that of adapting internal Jewish sources. Many Yiddishists and Hebraists regarded the proper translation and incorporation of the entirety of human literary creativity as necessary to the development of a worthwhile, unparochial modern Jewish culture. Part and parcel of this attitude was the approach to translation itself: Der Nister's translation makes no effort to Judaize or de-Christianize Andersen, thus breaking with one of the most definitive tendencies of Jewish cultural translation in the diaspora. This insistence on not Judaizing a text and on bringing core texts of other literatures and cultures into Jewish culture through neutral, artful translation was normative for the Jewish literary sphere of the time, and dozens if not hundreds of Hebrew and Yiddish writers undertook translations in this spirit.\n\n**4\\. The publisher of the book:** The Kiever Farlag was one of dozens of publishing houses created in this period with a specific commitment to promoting the creation of a new secular Jewish aesthetic culture. Kiev was a key center of this undertaking in these years, as were Moscow, Vilna, Warsaw, and Odessa; unlike the last three, Kiev and Moscow had never played such a central role in the modern Jewish cultural sphere until the disruptions and dramatic new opportunities of this era.\n\n**5\\. The distributor of the book:** By 1919, all of the Kiever Farlag publications, as well as those of nearly a dozen other Yiddishist publishing houses in Kiev and Odessa, were distributed exclusively by the Central Bookstore of the Ukrainian Kultur Lige (League for Culture). Created in Kiev in 1918 by left-wing but also independent and non-socialist Yiddishists, the Kultur Lige hoped to organize all Yiddishist cultural activity under one umbrella organization, from the hundreds of Yiddishist secular schools which emerged in this period to the most rarified art, music, theatrical, and literary experimentation. In this, it was not alone: it joined and competed directly with a similar Hebraist organization created in Moscow in 1917, the Tarbut (Culture) organization. Tarbut and the Kultur Lige spurred the creation of sister organizations allover Eastern Europe.\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/moss.jpg)\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/moss1.jpg)\n\n### Russian Poet - Jewish Muse\n\nHamutal Bar-Yosef\n\nPresented is a photo from the late 1910's of the Russian writer Leonid Andreev (1871-1919), along with a pencil drawing of L. E. Chirikova, a young Jewish woman with whom Andreev was in love. They are included in the book S. O. S. : Diaries (1914-1919), Letters (1917-1919), Essay and an Interview (1919), Memoirs of His Contemporanies (in Russian), edited by Richard Davies and Ben Hellman (1994). The title echoes Andreev's booklet from 1919, which was written when Andreev was already in exile in Finland, calling for the intervention of the West against the Bolshevik regime.\n\nDuring the first quarter of the 20th century Andreev's prose writings were widely translated into Yiddish, both in Eastern Europe and in the USA, and his dramas were included in the repertoire of the Yiddish theatre. His criticism of Christian society together with his declared philo-Semitism is among the reasons for his popularity in Yiddish. Andreev, together with M. Gorky and F. Sologub, was active for the civil rights of the Jews from 1914 until his death. Andreev was much less popular in Hebrew than in Yiddish. The difference between the enthusiastic reception of his writings in Yiddish culture, while neglected by the Hebrew, sheds an interesting light on the differences between these two Jews sub-cultures: while Yiddish was becoming an urban bourgeois culture, Hebrew was keeping artistically elite norms. ![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/bar-yosef.jpg)\n\n### Women Yiddish Poets in Poland: the 1920s\n\nKathryn Hellerstein\n\nFour of the five images here are taken from an anthology of women Yiddish poets published in Chicago in 1928, _Yidishe dikhterins: antologye_ (Yiddish Women Poets: Anthology), edited by Ezra Korman (Chicago: Farlag L. M. Stein, 1928). This anthology - the only such collection ever published - presented to the Yiddish literary community the works of 70 women poets, including four who published in the 16th through the 18th centuries, and 66 whose works appeared in print between 1888 and 1927. Modeled on an earlier anthology of Yiddish poetry, M. Bassin's _Finf hundert yor yidishe poezye_ (Five Hundred Years of Yiddish Poetry) (New York: 1917), Korman's anthology established the significance of women poets in the newly acknowledged modern Yiddish literary tradition. Korman supplemented the poems that he had selected from newspapers, journals, and books with scholarly apparatus, including a footnoted introductory essay, biographical notes, bibliographies, indexes, and photographs or drawings of many of the poets.\n\nThe first photograph, captioned, \"_Shar-bleter fun lider-zamlungen_\" (Title pages of poetry collections) in this exhibit precedes Korman's bibliography, and depicts a collage of the title pages of 12 books of Yiddish poetry by women - all published in the seven years before Korman's anthology came into print. Included in this collage (2nd from the top, on the right) is one of the first published books of poems by a woman, Miriam Ulinover's _Der bobes oyster_ (My Grandmother's Treasure) (Warsaw: Farlag Akhim Levin-Epshteyn un Shutfim, 1922). Directly below is the title page for _Mayne gezangen_ (My Songs), by Roza Yakubovitsh (Warsaw: 1924). In the center of the top row is the title page of _Kheshvndike nekht_ (Nights of Heshvan) by Kadya Molodowsky (Vilna-Warsaw: Farlag B. Kletskin, 1927). These three works, published in Warsaw and Vilna, differ from the other books of poems depicted in this collage - which came into print in New York, Chicago, Berlin, and Johannesburg, South Africa, as well as in Kovno.\n\nIn contrast to the political and/or modernist poetry written by many of their contemporaries--both male and female--the 1920s poems of Ulinover, Yakubovitsh, and Molodowsky contend with the traditional devotional texts that had defined the literacy and lives of their mothers and grandmothers. In the persona of a young woman who grew up in a _shtetele_ or small Jewish town, Ulinover's poems invoke the taytsh-_khumesh_, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Yiddish for girls, women, and uneducated men, printed from the 16th century well into the 19th century, and pay special attention to the characters of the Matriarch Rebecca, as well as to Queen Esther. Yakubovitsh's poems present dramatic monologues in the voices of biblical women, including Rachel, Hagar, Shulamit, and Queen Esther, drawing upon the _Tsenerene_, Yakov ben Yitzchak Ashkenazi's 16thcentury Yiddish translation of and commentary on the weekly Torah portions and Haftorahs, as well as the _tkhines_, the Yiddish supplicatory prayers composed for and sometimes by women. Several of Molodowsky's early poems are called \"Prayer,\" while others invoke imagery from the Hebrew liturgy of the _Siddur_ as well as of the _tkhines_ and the Bible. In the highly politicized, sophisticated, and urban context of Yiddish culture in interwar Warsaw, these three poets struggled in their poems to come to terms with the conflict between traditional Jewish texts and their modern lives. As a Fellow in Spring 2003 at the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, I have continued my work on Yiddish poetry by women, focusing on its place within the variously defined traditions of modern Yiddish literature and on the relationship between secular and devotional writings.\n\nAlongside the Korman's collage of title pages, I've provided photographs of four women Yiddish poets: Miriam Ulinover, Roza Yakubovitsh, Kadya Molodowsky, and Rokhl Korn, whose first book of poems, _Dorf_ (\"Village\"), was published in Vilna in 1928. The photographs of Yakubovitsh, Molodowsky, and Korn are taken from Korman's anthology. The photograph of Ulinover, the only existing photograph of this poet, was taken from her identification papers in the Lodz Ghetto, where she lived from 1939 until her death in Auschwitz in 1944. Yakubovitsh also spent the war years in the Lodz Ghetto and probably also died in Auschwitz. Molodowsky immigrated to the United States in 1935. Korn survived the war in the Soviet Union and came to Canada in 1948.\n\n![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/hellerstein-collage1928.jpg)![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/hellerstein-MIRIAMULINOVER.jpg)![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/hellerstein-ROZA_YAKUBOVITSH.jpg)![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/hellerstein-KADYAMOLODOWSKY.jpg)![](../../../../src/assets/tradition/hellerstein-ROKHLKORN.jpg)\n\n### YIVO, oder Yidisher visnshaftlekher institut\n\nCecile Kuznitz\n\nIn 1925, a group of Jewish intellectuals and educators founded an institution devoted to scholarship in Yiddish and on the history and culture of Yiddish-speaking Jewry. This institution, the _Yidisher visnshaftlekher institut_ \\[Yiddish Scientific Institute\\], known by its acronym YIVO, carries on its work today as the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. YIVO's founders came from the ranks of Diaspora Nationalists, who advocated rights for Jews as a national minority within the countries of Eastern Europe and a national culture based in the Yiddish language. The institute's work, therefore, was intimately connected to the _folk_, the masses of ordinary Yiddish-speaking Jews. YIVO's scholars felt compelled to address contemporary issues of concern to a broad audience even as they shied away from direct involvement in the political debates of interwar Eastern Europe, which they feared would compromise the quality of their research.\n\nWhile the original plan for YIVO came from a group of Russian Jewish intellectuals living in Berlin and headed by Nokhem Shtif, the institute established its headquarters in Vilna (then Wilno, Poland and today Vilnius, Lithuania). There, under the leadership of Max Weinreich, Zalman Reisen, and later Zelig Kalmanovitch, YIVO developed in close contact with the Yiddish cultural scene and secular school system that flourished in the interwar years. YIVO eventually built its headquarters in Vilna, an up-to-date, freestanding structure in a newly-developed neighborhood of broad streets and grassy plots. \\[see image #1\\] The building's appearance and location emphasized YIVO's distance, ideologically as well as physically, from the more traditional institutions of the revered but decrepit Jewish quarter.\n\nTo finance the construction of the headquarters, as well as most of its other projects, YIVO turned to thousands of dedicated supporters in Eastern Europe and throughout the world-wide Yiddish-speaking Diaspora. Contributors to YIVO's _boy-fund_ \\[building fund\\] received colorful receipts designed by the artist Uma Olkienicka. \\[see image #2\\] The strikingly avant-garde design of these receipts, like the headquarters itself, speaks to YIVO's desire to help East European Jewry create a new type of secular Yiddish culture that would be both fully Jewish and thoroughly modern.\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200125182311im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/kuznitz.jpg)\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200125182311im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/kuznitz2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n### Salo Baron, of Tarnow\n\nDavid Engel\n\nSalo Baron (1895-1989), a seminal figure in Jewish historiography, is generally identified with the United States, where he taught and wrote for more than six decades. However, he grew up in the west Galician town of Tarnow and began his historical studies at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. At age 17 he began publishing political commentary in the Krakow Hebrew weekly Hamicpe, including a five-part series responding to Polish nationalist leader Roman Dmowski's call for Poles to boycott Jewish businesses. Baron's experiences in Poland and as Polish a refugee in Vienna during and after the First World War shaped much of his later historiographical outlook, including his famous revision of \"the lachrymose theory of pre-Revolutionary woe.\" ![](../../../assets/tradition/engel.jpg)\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200125182311im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/engel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n### A Multi-Lingual Diary from Ghetto Lodz\n\nBatsheva Ben-Amos\n\nWhen Abraham Bankel returned from Auschwitz on July 1945 he went to his old home in Ghetto Lodz. In the dwelling next door he found an anonymous diary, written on the margins of a French novel, in four languages, Polish, Hebrew, Yiddish and English, with occasional sentences in German and a few words in Latin. This document is now among the holdings of Yad-Vashem.\n\nDiary writing by Jewish people during the war in Ghettos, camps and hiding all over Europe was an obsession. Emmanuel Ringelblum, a historian in Ghetto Warswa who organized the underground archive of \"Oneg Shabat\" in the ghetto, wrote in 1943:\n\n> \"The terror increased \\[and\\]... Jews started to write. Everybody wrote: journalists, writers, teachers, public people, teenagers and even children. most wrote diaries, describing the events of the day through the prism of personal experiences. Much has been written but most of it was lost in the expulsion and destruction of the Jews...\"\n\nWhile most diaries were written in one language, the anonymous Lodz diary is uniqe in its multi-lingual aspect. This must be seen in the context of the use of multiple languages in Jewish Polish society in the interwar years. The writer alternate use of Polish, Yiddish and Hebrew languages in the diary is consistent with the linguistic fabric of the Jewish culture which existed in Poland between the two world wars. The use of English is idiosyncratic and is not a part of the multi-lingual system in Poland among the Jews. Such a system developed through Jewish education, tradition, speech at home, and in contact with the local population and the governments.\n\nIn his diary, the writer deals with moral dilemas, his relationship with his sister, conflicts related to his Jewish identity, his hunger and anguish and his desire to survive. At the end the Russians halted their advance and the Nazis liquidated the Ghetto, transporting its residents, among them probably also the diarist and his 12 years old sister, to Auschwitz, where they perished.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200125182311im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/ben-amos.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n![](../../../assets/tradition/Ben-Amos.jpg)\n\n### Di Goldene Keyt (1949-1995)\n\nMarcus Moseley\n\nIn 1949, through the initiative of the Vilna poet Avrom Sutzkever, Di Goldene keyt was founded, published by the Histadrut/\"General Federations of Jewsish Labour in Israel\". That a Zionist organization in Israel should undertake the publication of a Yiddish literary periodical, given the background of intense and bitter rivalry between Hebraists and Yiddishists, marked a groundbreaking historical event in and of itself.\n\nIn a programmatic article, \"Between Hebrew and Yiddish\", in the first volume the Hebrew and Yiddish poet and literary critic Ya'aqov Fichman writes: \"It is a disgrace and an incomprehensibility that Hebrew poets know so little of their Yiddish fellow-writers ... that the Hebrew press provides so few appraisals of Yiddish creativity (giving so much place for general literature) ... The task of the Goldene keyt must be first and foremost to combat the mutual alienation between Hebrew and Yiddish creativity. Hebrew and Yiddish poets must help each other, and above all else, **know** each other and exert mutual influence upon each other.\"\n\nThe proclamation in bold type at the end of this essay reads:\n\n> **Not only the Jews did our mortal enemy determine to annihilate and to turn into soap, but also their language, and the golden chain. But the language outlived the enemy. And the chain, through ghettos, forests and insurrections, extended underground, wounded, agonized, saturated with the tears in the throes of death of those who forged it, sanctified by the martyrdom of those closest to us ... and it fastened its links more tightly, tunneled its way through the various cities and broke into the light of day in Israel ... the land of generations-long Jewish yearning, whence the surviving remnant of the people now stream; the land which heals our blood-stained yesterday with the blood of our great today.**\n\nThe first volume of the Goldene Keyt, constituting no less than 240 pages held true to its aims. Here we may find, inter alia: previously unpublished Yiddish texts of Bialik; a Yiddish translation of a poem by Tshernikhovsky by Aaron Tseitlin; a children's play by Sholem Aleichem published for the first time; an essay by Berl Shtok (later Dov Sadan) on Agnon; a poem by Melekh Ravitsch \"With a Diary from the Warsaw Ghetto\"; an essay \"The Yiddish and the Hebrew Folksong\"; a poem \"The Ethical Will of Nissim Laniado, by Avrom Sutzkever; translations to Yiddish of poems of Natan Alterman.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200125182311im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/moseley1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200125182311im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/moseley2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\"> \u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200125182311im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/moseley3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\n![](../../../assets/tradition/moseley2.jpg)\n\n![](../../../assets/tradition/moseley3.jpg)\n\n## Selected Bibliography\n\n*   **Assaf, Simha. \"**Lekorot harabanut be-Ashkenaz, Polania ve-Lita,\" in _Reshumot 2_ (1922): 5-46\n    \n*   **An-Ski, S.** _The Dybbuk and Other Writings.,_ Edited and with an introduction by David G.

From among the ranks of East European Jews emerged many of the key religious, intellectual, artistic, and political currents that shaped Jewish life across the modern period. Over the course of the last two decades, the historic Jewish communities that once covered the broad swathe of territory between the Baltic and the Black Seas have moved to the center of the study of the modern Jewish experience. Fueled by unprecedented access to long-hidden archival riches in the former Soviet bloc, a new generation of scholars has carved out fresh questions and new arenas of inquiry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This year’s CAJS seminar explored a wide range of issues relating to the history and culture of East European Jewry. We studied the relationship between the elite and the popular, the Jewish and the Slavic, the literary and the historical. We scrutinized representations of the Jewish past and the Jewish self as well as the genealogy of our own enterprise, the rich legacy of reflection on Jewish Eastern Europe from the early modern to the post-Holocaust periods.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The documents presented in the exhibit that follows faithfully reproduce the breadth of curiosity of this year’s fellows.

In this part, which deals with the laws concerning what to do with those who fail to honor rabbis, Luria gives his opinion of the rabbinate in his day. Though its critical tone may be an expression of his well-known intellectual elitism, it draws an interesting comparison between the status of the rabbi in Jewish society and that of the nobleman in Polish society. In these years, Jewish society in Poland was refashioning the Ashkenazic rabbinate along Polish lines. The role played by the rabbis on behalf of the non-Jewish authorities in the administration of the Jewish communities led to the rabbinate taking on something of the character of the semi-honorific administrative posts like the \u003Cem>Wojewoda\u003C/em> or the \u003Cem>Starosta\u003C/em>, held by members of the high Polish nobility. This process of deprofessionalizing the rabbinate, whose early stages are here criticized by Luria, would eventually lead to a steep decline in the status of the rabbi in Polish Jewish life at the end of the 18th century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/teller.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/teller1.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/teller2.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"who-is-obligated-to-wear-tzitzit\">Who is Obligated to Wear Tzitzit\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Moshe Rosman\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Section 17 of the Shulhan Arukh, Orah Haim is entitled: “Who is Obligated [to Wear] Tzitzit?” The second paragraph, written by Joseph Karo in Safed in the mid-sixteenth century, reads: “Women and slaves are exempt because it is a time-conditioned positive commandment.” On this ruling, R. Moses Isserles (in Cracow ca. 1570) glossed: \u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“In any case, if they want to wear [a \u003Cem>tallit\u003C/em> ] and make the blessing over it, they may as with all other time-conditioned positive commandments; however, it appears to be arrogance [\u003Cem>yohara\u003C/em> ] (see Tosefot, Ro”sh and Ra”n on chapter two of TB Rosh ha-Shana and chapter one of TB Kiddushin), and therefore they should not wear tzitzit, since [in any case] it is not a personal obligation [\u003Cem>hovat gavra\u003C/em> ] (see Agur section 27)”.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Like all known societies, traditional Jewish society in Poland assigned differential tasks, manners and responsibilities to the two sexes. Just how essential this \u003Ca href=\"/web/20200125182338/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/tradition-and-its-discontents?tab=bibliography\">gender definition\u003C/a> was held to be is evident in the comment of Rabbi Moses Isserles (Cracow, 16c.), cited above, with regard to the permissibility of Jewish women ritually donning a garment with \u003Cem>tzitzit\u003C/em> (i.e. a \u003Cem>tallit\u003C/em> ). In this passage R. Isserles noted that wearing of \u003Cem>tzitzit\u003C/em> by women was permissible by technical halakhic standards. Despite this technical permissibility, however, echoing earlier authorities he ruled that women should not wear \u003Cem>tzitzit\u003C/em> because it betrayed \u003Cem>yohara\u003C/em> (arrogance) on their part.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Comparison of the use of the term \u003Cem>yohara\u003C/em> in other sixteenth century texts (e.g. J. Karo, Bet Yosef, Orah Haim 3:1, 24:2, 34:3, 90:24-25, quoting earlier sources), demonstrates that the term, as used here, probably connotes a person’s aspiring to an inappropriate status. R. Isserles’ appears to be saying that women who wear \u003Cem>tzitzit\u003C/em> are trying to attain the status of men, a status that does not properly accrue to them.

Ruelf gained an international reputation as a helper of Russian Jews beginning with his relief actions in the late 1860s. Thereafter, he strove to establish himself as expert on Eastern European Jewry and as a spokesman and intercessor (\u003Cem>shtadlan\u003C/em>) on their behalf. He used the press and public opinion as leverage for this activity, the most important change during the 19th century in the tactics of intercession. Following the anti-jewish violence in 1881/82 in Russia, he conceived of Palestine as the location for a future Jewish state that would be one of the safe havens of Russian Jewry. He thus was one of the precursors of political Zionism. As such, he was honored with one of the first portraits to be published in the (\u003Cem>Kneset Israel\u003C/em>).

State-sponsored restrictions on Jewish residence, a technique common to early modern European countries, persisted in Russia until the revolution of February 1917. By the 1880s, however, a series of laws made it possible for substantial numbers of Jews whom the government regarded as “useful” - veterans of Nicholas I’s army, merchants of the first guild, certain kinds of artisans, graduates of institutions of higher education - to live and work outside the Pale on a permanent basis. By the end of the 19th century, more than 300,000 such Jews lived legally outside the Pale.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Whether Shlomo Khaiklein sought temporary residence outside the Pale, or permanent settlement in the Russian interior, he was one of hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews on the move during the second half of the nineteenth century.

It refers to anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia that had recently broken-out From this set of events comes the now well-established historiographical concept of the “crisis of 1881-2”, and its role as the “turning point in modern Jewish history”.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The cartoon illustrates the theme, much discussed at the time, of the responsibility of the Russian press for provoking the pogroms. There was, in fact, no sustained press campaign accusing the Jews of having “murdered the tsar.” Few newspapers focused on Gesia Gel’fman, the sole Jewish member of the terrorist group of “The People’s Will” who assassinated Emperor Alexander II on 1 March 1881 (Old Style).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the other hand, a number of newspapers had been very energetic in attacking Russian Jewry for a long catalogue of sins, the most important of which was that of “exploiting the peasantry.” Thus, when the pogroms broke out, it was easy to make the connection, as the artist does here. Many contemporary Jewish spokesmen would also have applauded his choice of papers, since these were the very ones that they had denounced to the authorities for stirring up popular passions against the Jews.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The cartoon, captioned with the Russian proverb, “Don’t spit in the well you drink from!” reads from left to right. In the first scene, two well-known Russian publishers are driving two bemused Jews out of Russia. The publisher on the left is Ivan Aksakov, who carries a stick with a copy of his newspaper, \u003Cem>Rus’\u003C/em>, which was the name of the ancient Russia state. Aksakov, and his family, were associated with a movement known as the Slavophiles. The movement viewed with skepticism plans to westernize Russia, seeing the virtues of the country to lie in its old traditions. One of the symbols of westernization was Jewish emancipation, and Aksakov was well-known for opposing the grant of full rights to Russian Jews. \u003Cem>Rus’\u003C/em>, published in Moscow, had a very small circulation, and was almost entirely written by Aksakov himself, in a high-toned, intellectual style. It was a paper that few people bought, but everybody talked about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Next to Aksakov is A. S. Suvorin, one of the publishing geniuses of late imperial Russia. Suvorin took a small, liberal newspaper, \u003Cem>Novoe vremia\u003C/em> (New Times) and took it “downmarket” to create one of the most popular newspapers in the Empire. It was the antithesis of \u003Cem>Rus’\u003C/em> : filled with gossip, scandal and racy reporting. (The paper’s reputation was established by its on-the-scene reporting of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-8.) The paper published many of Russia’s greatest writers (including Anton Chekov, who didn’t much care for Suvorin’s Jew-baiting.) Suvorin quickly discovered that blaming the Jews for Russia’s problems (such as difficulties with the supply of the Russian army in 1877 by Jewish contractors) was popular with his readers. \u003Cem>Novoe vremia\u003C/em> attacked the Jews in a jocular, sarcastic tone, very unlike the rather pompous pronouncements of Aksakov. \u003Cem>Novoe vremia\u003C/em>, published in St Petersburg, was circulated throughout the Empire, so its Judeophobia was well-known and appreciated. Cheering on Aksakov and Suvorin are a group of Russian merchants (identifiable by their very distinctive garb). They clearly believe that, with the Jews driven out of Russia, their business will benefit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Scene two shows a very different outcome. Masses of Jews are leaving the country, clutching their meager possessions left after the riots, and heading for Palestine or America. In the background a gigantic figure looms, marked “Trade-Commercial Crisis”. The merchants, in great distress, try to restrain the departing Jews. The drawing takes note of the fall in Russian securities on world financial markets as a result of the pogroms, as well as the collapse of the regional economy in Ukraine, where the annual trade fairs, filled with Jews importing goods from Moscow, were cancelled or postponed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Quite appropriately the drawing is sub-titled “A Tragi-Comedy in Two Pictures.” The drawing is especially interesting because there are very few cartoons devoted to the impact of the pogroms (except for the topic of emigration, which was very popular with cartoonists).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/klier.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ojczyzna\">Ojczyzna\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Rachel Manekin\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The cover of the first pro-Polish Jewish newspapers in Galicia.

An-sky, born Shloyme-Zanvl Rapoport (1863-1920), was a Russian-Jewish writer, a pioneering ethnographer, and a dedicated revolutionary; he is known best today as the author of the play \u003Cem>The Dybbuk\u003C/em>. He spent much of 1918 preparing an edition of images that he had gathered during the ethnographic expeditions that he led to the Jewish communities of Volhynia and Podolia during the summers of 1912-1914. But as a Socialist Revolutionary who had been part of the Constituent Assembly elected after the February Revolution of 1917, An-sky feared for his safety under the Bolsheviks, the victors of the October Revolution. In the fall of 1918, he fled to Vilna, leaving most of his papers behind. The proofs of the “Album of Jewish Artistic Artifacts” were believed lost until, like many of his other manuscripts, they turned up in the 1990s in formerly Soviet archives. \u003Cem>The Jewish Artistic Heritage Album by Semyon An-sky\u003C/em>, published in Moscow in 2001 in Russian and English, includes all the plates that were found at the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine, along with two essays based on these and other recently rediscovered archival materials.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These two pictures reveal the man and his work. The photo shows him at 56 or 57, in the last year of his life, ill with diabetes and heart disease but retaining his famed energy for community work and writing. The colored image, one of the plates from the album, is a “lubok” or folk print that was produced in the second half of the nineteenth century in what is today Ukraine. The writing on the picture, in a mix of Yiddish and Hebrew, identifies the scene: “How Rebecca gives the camels drink and Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, kneels and honors God, Blessed be He (Vi Rivke poit di gamolim un Eliezer eved Avrom knit un loybt tsu got borukh ha-shem).” In his own edition, An-sky had intended to publish this image with a discussion of the Yiddish word used for Rebecca’s action, “poit,” which is obviously of Eastern Slavic origin; the same word is used in Russian to this day to mean “to give to drink.” The attention he gives to this linguistic detail illustrates An-sky’s sensitivity to the interaction both between languages and between nations or ethnic groups. Even though we associate him with the play he set in an exclusively Jewish world, all of An-sky’s texts - including, as recent scholarship and new archival evidence shows, \u003Cem>The Dybbuk\u003C/em> - emerged from a vision of Jewish folk culture and Jews themselves as existing in a state of constant, dynamic exchange with other peoples and other cultures. \u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/safran.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:1}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/safran2.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:1}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"between-austria-and-galicia-jewish-nationalism-and-diversity\">Between Austria and Galicia: Jewish Nationalism and Diversity\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Joshua Shanes\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 1907, Austria held its first parliamentary elections based on universal manhood suffrage. Jewish nationalists, electrified by the prospect of winning parliamentary mandates, decided to enter the electoral campaign full-force. Jewish nationalists nominated candidates in nearly every district with significant Jewish settlement, even if they had no realistic chance of winning. Although they certainly hoped to win election in districts with large Jewish majorities, their primary purpose was to use the electoral campaign as a means of engaging Galician Jews in the political process. Jewish nationalists held hundreds of rallies in large and small communities throughout the entire province at which their best orators tried to convince Jews that they too constituted a nationality to which national minority rights were due.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Aside from the actual content of the speeches, the rallies themselves served as a critical agent in forging a common sense of national community among Galician Jews. Rallies attracted Jews from all classes, men and women, young and old, religious and secular. All stood together and often intermixed (by all of those criteria) as they listened to speeches calling for Jewish solidarity and national struggle. \u003Ca href=\"/web/20200125182338/https://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/online-exhibits/tradition-and-its-discontents/between-austria-and-galicia-jewish?item=0\">This photograph of a mass rally in Buczacz\u003C/a> for the Jewish nationalist candidate Nathan Birnbaum (standing in front row center), for example, shows men and women of clearly middle-class dress, women with uncovered hair and shaved men with “German”-style hats, standing and sitting together with Jews of an obviously much lower social class, many of whom covered their hair (among the women) or wore long beards.

The German authorities published its announcements in some of the local vernaculars, including Yiddish. Official translations of regulations and regulatory texts were produced in several vernaculars, including Yiddish. This bureaucratic measure was interpreted as a great victory of the Jewish national movement and a sign of the integration of the Jews as individuals as well as collective equals in the public arena.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, this translation was not authoritative since only the German version was recognized as authentic.

Official forms, personal ID, and so on appeared in Yiddish as in Polish or Lithuanian. When Rachmilewitsch, Rosenbaum and Rubinstein, the most outstanding pro-German Jewish leaders in Vilnius complained in 1917 that the Ost-mark bill felt Yiddish translation and asked for it, the authorities tended to accept the request. Their answer is very revealing and is paradigmatic concerning the German formal recognition of the minorities during the first two years of occupation: “doubtlessly we could promise the implementation of national demands lacking importance, like printing Hebrew letters on the [ostmark] notes”. After such an answer it is not surprising that these leaders never asked again for such symbolic signs. Over and over again, it became clear that the pattern established was that of constituting a unidirectional way of communication, from up down, between the government and the subject.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The politics regarding the recognition of the different minorities was in the best case, formal. It lacked any operative meaning.

This striking image stems from that moment: it is a cover page by the Russian-Jewish modernist artist El Lissitzky to a translation of Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tales by the Yiddish modernist writer Der Nister, published in Kiev in 1919 by the literary publisher the Kiever Farlag under the auspices of the Yiddishist cultural organization the Kultur-Lige.

Lissitzky and the fact of his involvement in this book project:\u003C/strong> Artists of Jewish origin had long been part of Europe’s metropolitan art scenes, including the Russian and Polish art academies. Some had explored Jewish themes and their own Jewish identities, but had done so within the framework of the metropolitan art-world of which they were a part. The revolutionary period saw a dramatically different development: the intensive involvement and identification of such artists in a larger effort by Jewish nationalist intellectuals and cultural producers to create a full-fledged Jewish aesthetic culture centering around Yiddish or Hebrew but encompassing all the arts. Producing illustrations for the flood of Yiddish and Hebrew books, journals, and children’s books like this one was one of the key expressions of this involvement; these artists also produced extraordinary set designs for Hebrew and Yiddish modernist theaters springing up in Moscow, Kiev, and elsewhere, and many also exhibited at specially organized exhibitions of Jewish art and involve themselves in specially organized Jewish art studios, especially in Kiev. For many artists like Lissitzky, this identification was short-lived, lasting not more than two or three years. The brevity of their involvement demonstrates the difficulty and perhaps impossibilities of creating a full-fledged Jewish secular national culture in the diaspora; the depth and intensity of their involvement demonstrates the power and attractiveness of the idea at this historical juncture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>3. The text being illustrated, the significance of the choice of this text, and the nature of the translation:\u003C/strong> \u003Cbr>\nHistorians of modern Jewish culture tend to lay heavy emphasis on the way in which modern cultural producers reinterpreted “authentically Jewish” sources ranging from the Bible to the aggadah to East European Jewish folklore. We can see these strategies in Lissitzky’s illustration, which adapts formal motifs from Jewish folk art and, as the historian Chimen Abramsky notes, signs his initials (bottom right) “in a manner taken directly from medieval Ashkenazi Hebrew manuscripts.” However, when it comes to the book itself, it is a different story. Especially in the period in question and especially with regard to literary texts like this one, these emphases miss the point in some important respects. The choice by Der Nister, a leading Yiddish symbolist, to translate the quite bun-Jewish’ Hans Christian Andersen for Jewish children was not a fluke or an idiosyncratic decision, but represents rather a strategy of Jewish cultural development no less important for the nationalist intelligentsia in this period than that of adapting internal Jewish sources. Many Yiddishists and Hebraists regarded the proper translation and incorporation of the entirety of human literary creativity as necessary to the development of a worthwhile, unparochial modern Jewish culture. Part and parcel of this attitude was the approach to translation itself: Der Nister’s translation makes no effort to Judaize or de-Christianize Andersen, thus breaking with one of the most definitive tendencies of Jewish cultural translation in the diaspora. This insistence on not Judaizing a text and on bringing core texts of other literatures and cultures into Jewish culture through neutral, artful translation was normative for the Jewish literary sphere of the time, and dozens if not hundreds of Hebrew and Yiddish writers undertook translations in this spirit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>4. The publisher of the book:\u003C/strong> The Kiever Farlag was one of dozens of publishing houses created in this period with a specific commitment to promoting the creation of a new secular Jewish aesthetic culture. Kiev was a key center of this undertaking in these years, as were Moscow, Vilna, Warsaw, and Odessa; unlike the last three, Kiev and Moscow had never played such a central role in the modern Jewish cultural sphere until the disruptions and dramatic new opportunities of this era.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>5. The distributor of the book:\u003C/strong> By 1919, all of the Kiever Farlag publications, as well as those of nearly a dozen other Yiddishist publishing houses in Kiev and Odessa, were distributed exclusively by the Central Bookstore of the Ukrainian Kultur Lige (League for Culture). Created in Kiev in 1918 by left-wing but also independent and non-socialist Yiddishists, the Kultur Lige hoped to organize all Yiddishist cultural activity under one umbrella organization, from the hundreds of Yiddishist secular schools which emerged in this period to the most rarified art, music, theatrical, and literary experimentation. In this, it was not alone: it joined and competed directly with a similar Hebraist organization created in Moscow in 1917, the Tarbut (Culture) organization. Tarbut and the Kultur Lige spurred the creation of sister organizations allover Eastern Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/moss.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/moss1.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"russian-poet---jewish-muse\">Russian Poet - Jewish Muse\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Hamutal Bar-Yosef\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Presented is a photo from the late 1910’s of the Russian writer Leonid Andreev (1871-1919), along with a pencil drawing of L. E. Chirikova, a young Jewish woman with whom Andreev was in love. They are included in the book S. O. S. : Diaries (1914-1919), Letters (1917-1919), Essay and an Interview (1919), Memoirs of His Contemporanies (in Russian), edited by Richard Davies and Ben Hellman (1994). The title echoes Andreev’s booklet from 1919, which was written when Andreev was already in exile in Finland, calling for the intervention of the West against the Bolshevik regime.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>During the first quarter of the 20th century Andreev’s prose writings were widely translated into Yiddish, both in Eastern Europe and in the USA, and his dramas were included in the repertoire of the Yiddish theatre. His criticism of Christian society together with his declared philo-Semitism is among the reasons for his popularity in Yiddish. Andreev, together with M. Gorky and F. Sologub, was active for the civil rights of the Jews from 1914 until his death. Andreev was much less popular in Hebrew than in Yiddish. The difference between the enthusiastic reception of his writings in Yiddish culture, while neglected by the Hebrew, sheds an interesting light on the differences between these two Jews sub-cultures: while Yiddish was becoming an urban bourgeois culture, Hebrew was keeping artistically elite norms. \u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/bar-yosef.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"women-yiddish-poets-in-poland-the-1920s\">Women Yiddish Poets in Poland: the 1920s\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Kathryn Hellerstein\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Four of the five images here are taken from an anthology of women Yiddish poets published in Chicago in 1928, \u003Cem>Yidishe dikhterins: antologye\u003C/em> (Yiddish Women Poets: Anthology), edited by Ezra Korman (Chicago: Farlag L. M. Stein, 1928). This anthology - the only such collection ever published - presented to the Yiddish literary community the works of 70 women poets, including four who published in the 16th through the 18th centuries, and 66 whose works appeared in print between 1888 and 1927. Modeled on an earlier anthology of Yiddish poetry, M. Bassin’s \u003Cem>Finf hundert yor yidishe poezye\u003C/em> (Five Hundred Years of Yiddish Poetry) (New York: 1917), Korman’s anthology established the significance of women poets in the newly acknowledged modern Yiddish literary tradition. Korman supplemented the poems that he had selected from newspapers, journals, and books with scholarly apparatus, including a footnoted introductory essay, biographical notes, bibliographies, indexes, and photographs or drawings of many of the poets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first photograph, captioned, “\u003Cem>Shar-bleter fun lider-zamlungen\u003C/em>” (Title pages of poetry collections) in this exhibit precedes Korman’s bibliography, and depicts a collage of the title pages of 12 books of Yiddish poetry by women - all published in the seven years before Korman’s anthology came into print. Included in this collage (2nd from the top, on the right) is one of the first published books of poems by a woman, Miriam Ulinover’s \u003Cem>Der bobes oyster\u003C/em> (My Grandmother’s Treasure) (Warsaw: Farlag Akhim Levin-Epshteyn un Shutfim, 1922). Directly below is the title page for \u003Cem>Mayne gezangen\u003C/em> (My Songs), by Roza Yakubovitsh (Warsaw: 1924). In the center of the top row is the title page of \u003Cem>Kheshvndike nekht\u003C/em> (Nights of Heshvan) by Kadya Molodowsky (Vilna-Warsaw: Farlag B. Kletskin, 1927). These three works, published in Warsaw and Vilna, differ from the other books of poems depicted in this collage - which came into print in New York, Chicago, Berlin, and Johannesburg, South Africa, as well as in Kovno.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In contrast to the political and/or modernist poetry written by many of their contemporaries—both male and female—the 1920s poems of Ulinover, Yakubovitsh, and Molodowsky contend with the traditional devotional texts that had defined the literacy and lives of their mothers and grandmothers. In the persona of a young woman who grew up in a \u003Cem>shtetele\u003C/em> or small Jewish town, Ulinover’s poems invoke the taytsh-\u003Cem>khumesh\u003C/em>, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Yiddish for girls, women, and uneducated men, printed from the 16th century well into the 19th century, and pay special attention to the characters of the Matriarch Rebecca, as well as to Queen Esther. Yakubovitsh’s poems present dramatic monologues in the voices of biblical women, including Rachel, Hagar, Shulamit, and Queen Esther, drawing upon the \u003Cem>Tsenerene\u003C/em>, Yakov ben Yitzchak Ashkenazi’s 16thcentury Yiddish translation of and commentary on the weekly Torah portions and Haftorahs, as well as the \u003Cem>tkhines\u003C/em>, the Yiddish supplicatory prayers composed for and sometimes by women. Several of Molodowsky’s early poems are called “Prayer,” while others invoke imagery from the Hebrew liturgy of the \u003Cem>Siddur\u003C/em> as well as of the \u003Cem>tkhines\u003C/em> and the Bible. In the highly politicized, sophisticated, and urban context of Yiddish culture in interwar Warsaw, these three poets struggled in their poems to come to terms with the conflict between traditional Jewish texts and their modern lives. As a Fellow in Spring 2003 at the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, I have continued my work on Yiddish poetry by women, focusing on its place within the variously defined traditions of modern Yiddish literature and on the relationship between secular and devotional writings.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Alongside the Korman’s collage of title pages, I’ve provided photographs of four women Yiddish poets: Miriam Ulinover, Roza Yakubovitsh, Kadya Molodowsky, and Rokhl Korn, whose first book of poems, \u003Cem>Dorf\u003C/em> (“Village”), was published in Vilna in 1928. The photographs of Yakubovitsh, Molodowsky, and Korn are taken from Korman’s anthology. The photograph of Ulinover, the only existing photograph of this poet, was taken from her identification papers in the Lodz Ghetto, where she lived from 1939 until her death in Auschwitz in 1944. Yakubovitsh also spent the war years in the Lodz Ghetto and probably also died in Auschwitz. Molodowsky immigrated to the United States in 1935. Korn survived the war in the Soviet Union and came to Canada in 1948.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/hellerstein-collage1928.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/hellerstein-MIRIAMULINOVER.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/hellerstein-ROZA_YAKUBOVITSH.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/hellerstein-KADYAMOLODOWSKY.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../../src/assets/tradition/hellerstein-ROKHLKORN.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"yivo-oder-yidisher-visnshaftlekher-institut\">YIVO, oder Yidisher visnshaftlekher institut\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Cecile Kuznitz\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 1925, a group of Jewish intellectuals and educators founded an institution devoted to scholarship in Yiddish and on the history and culture of Yiddish-speaking Jewry. This institution, the \u003Cem>Yidisher visnshaftlekher institut\u003C/em> [Yiddish Scientific Institute], known by its acronym YIVO, carries on its work today as the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. YIVO’s founders came from the ranks of Diaspora Nationalists, who advocated rights for Jews as a national minority within the countries of Eastern Europe and a national culture based in the Yiddish language. The institute’s work, therefore, was intimately connected to the \u003Cem>folk\u003C/em>, the masses of ordinary Yiddish-speaking Jews. YIVO’s scholars felt compelled to address contemporary issues of concern to a broad audience even as they shied away from direct involvement in the political debates of interwar Eastern Europe, which they feared would compromise the quality of their research.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While the original plan for YIVO came from a group of Russian Jewish intellectuals living in Berlin and headed by Nokhem Shtif, the institute established its headquarters in Vilna (then Wilno, Poland and today Vilnius, Lithuania). There, under the leadership of Max Weinreich, Zalman Reisen, and later Zelig Kalmanovitch, YIVO developed in close contact with the Yiddish cultural scene and secular school system that flourished in the interwar years. YIVO eventually built its headquarters in Vilna, an up-to-date, freestanding structure in a newly-developed neighborhood of broad streets and grassy plots. [see image #1] The building’s appearance and location emphasized YIVO’s distance, ideologically as well as physically, from the more traditional institutions of the revered but decrepit Jewish quarter.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To finance the construction of the headquarters, as well as most of its other projects, YIVO turned to thousands of dedicated supporters in Eastern Europe and throughout the world-wide Yiddish-speaking Diaspora. Contributors to YIVO’s \u003Cem>boy-fund\u003C/em> [building fund] received colorful receipts designed by the artist Uma Olkienicka. [see image #2] The strikingly avant-garde design of these receipts, like the headquarters itself, speaks to YIVO’s desire to help East European Jewry create a new type of secular Yiddish culture that would be both fully Jewish and thoroughly modern.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200125182311im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/kuznitz.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200125182311im_/https://www.library.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/kuznitz2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2588\">\n\u003Ch3 id=\"salo-baron-of-tarnow\">Salo Baron, of Tarnow\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>David Engel\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Salo Baron (1895-1989), a seminal figure in Jewish historiography, is generally identified with the United States, where he taught and wrote for more than six decades.

At age 17 he began publishing political commentary in the Krakow Hebrew weekly Hamicpe, including a five-part series responding to Polish nationalist leader Roman Dmowski’s call for Poles to boycott Jewish businesses.

This must be seen in the context of the use of multiple languages in Jewish Polish society in the interwar years. The writer alternate use of Polish, Yiddish and Hebrew languages in the diary is consistent with the linguistic fabric of the Jewish culture which existed in Poland between the two world wars. The use of English is idiosyncratic and is not a part of the multi-lingual system in Poland among the Jews. Such a system developed through Jewish education, tradition, speech at home, and in contact with the local population and the governments.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In his diary, the writer deals with moral dilemas, his relationship with his sister, conflicts related to his Jewish identity, his hunger and anguish and his desire to survive.
