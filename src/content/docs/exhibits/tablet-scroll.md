title: "Tablet, Scroll, & Book: Judaic Treasures"
description: " Since the Maccabean era, Jewish texts were often targets of destruction, especially during the Middle Ages when Christian authorities censored and burned them. Notably, in 1242, 24 cartloads of rabbinic manuscripts were burned in Paris. This pattern continued through the Holocaust, when Jewish libraries were decimated. Despite these losses, some manuscripts and early printed works (incunabula) survived, underscoring the importance of preserving Judaic heritage."
